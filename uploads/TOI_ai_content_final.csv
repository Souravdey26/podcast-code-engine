The company has introduced different versions of ChatGPT since then with the latest being GPT-4o. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has now hinted at the next iteration of ChatGPT – GPT-5 . According to a report by The Decoder, Altman talked about GPT-5 at the Aspen Ideas Festival. He said that the company still has a lot of work to do on the next version of ChatGPT. The company wants to address errors seen in GPT-4 I with GPT-5. Here’s What Sam Altman said? “We don't know yet. We are optimistic, but we still have a lot of work to do on it,"" Altman said. ""I expect it (GPT-5) to be a significant leap forward. A lot of the things that GPT-4 gets wrong, you know, can't do much in the way of reasoning, sometimes just sort of totally goes off the rails and makes a dumb mistake, like even a six-year-old would never make,"" he further added. Altman, however, did not reveal any specific detail or launch date of the ChatGPT model which is currently under the stage of development. Recently, OpenAI’s vice president Srinivas Narayanan shared two things to help India’s AI mission. Speaking at the Global India AI Summit 2024 on Wednesday (July 3), Srinivas Narayanan, vice president at OpenAI, mentioned that the Microsoft-backed company “is ready to help in any possible way.” “Language and cost are top of mind for OpenAI. We have received a lot of feedback from the Indian community, and GPT 4o was developed to address this feedback,” Narayanan said while addressing the keynote panel India AI: Large Language Models. Narayanan stated that OpenAI has been “developing a growing habit on a leadership team to keep learning from India.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-ceo-sam-altman-hints-at-gpt-5-says-i-expect-it-to-be/articleshow/111477941.cms

2024-07-04,Australia spy agency moves intelligence data to cloud in Amazon deal,Reuters,"SYDNEY: Australia will move its top-secret intelligence data to the cloud under a A$2 billion deal with Amazon Web Services that defence minister Richard Marles said would boost defence force interoperability with the United States. The director general of the Australian Signals Directorate, Rachel Noble, said the national security agency would also increase its use of artificial intelligence (AI) to analyse data under the shift, which would see top-secret data centres built in Australia. ""Artificial intelligence is an important game changer for all of us in the intelligence community, and we are working to embrace the use of it in an ethical, well governed and well-understood manner, where we understand very carefully when we bring AI tools into our environment how are they being used, what are they doing to the data and do we understand how carefully they need to be governed?"" Noble said in Canberra on Thursday. The move to cloud services run by Amazon Web Services, using distributed, purpose-built facilities, would give greater resilience to data used to support the defence force, Marles said at a press conference. ""If one server goes down you are still able to operate,"" he said. ""This is what will ensure we have a common computing operating environment with the United States defence forces in the future."" Director-General of National Intelligence, Andrew Shearer, told reporters interoperability with security partners such as the United States was a priority.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/australia-spy-agency-moves-intelligence-data-to-cloud-in-amazon-deal/articleshow/111473516.cms
2024-07-03,"This country has suspended Meta's AI privacy policy, here’s why",TOI Tech Desk,"Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta is facing a privacy policy suspension in Brazil , reports Reuters. The country's National Data Protection Authority ( ANPD ) has put on hold the social media giant’s new privacy policy for the use of personal data to train generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems in the country. As per the report, Meta’s AI policy has been suspended with immediate effect. Why Brazil has suspended Meta’s AI privacy policy? ANPD has released an official gazette notification stating that it has put on hold the processing of personal data across all Meta products – Messenger, Facebook and WhatsApp. These also include those of people who are not users of the tech giant's platforms. In its decision, ANPD has cited ""imminent risk of serious and irreparable or difficult-to-repair damage to the fundamental rights of affected holders."" What this suspension means for Meta? With the AI privacy policy suspension, Meta can not use/process users data to train its Gen AI systems. According to the Brazilian authority, the company will also need to adapt its privacy policy to exclude the section related to the processing of personal data for generative AI training. “It will also be required to present an official statement saying it suspended the processing of personal data for that purpose,” the Reuters report said. Meta said in a statement that it was ""disappointed"" by ANPD's decision. The move represents a ""setback for innovation"" and will delay the arrival of AI benefits to the people of Brazil, it added. ""We are more transparent than many players in this industry who have used public content to train their models and products,"" Meta said. ""Our approach complies with privacy laws and regulations in Brazil."" In another news, Meta may be fined by the European Union (EU) for breaking the bloc’s digital laws. Worried about Meta’s ‘pay or consent’ models, the EU regulators are expected to issue preliminary findings this week, reported Financial Times.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-country-has-suspended-metas-ai-privacy-policy-heres-why/articleshow/111451690.cms

2024-07-02,Apple eyes paid subscriptions for advanced AI features,TOI Tech Desk,"Apple's foray into artificial intelligence (AI) might take a turn towards paid services, according to a report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. While Apple Intelligence, , the AI platform, will initially be free, whispers suggest plans to eventually monetise advanced features through a subscription model. This strategy mirrors existing services like iCloud+, where basic features are free, but enhanced functionality requires a monthly fee. As per the report, Apple Intelligence could offer a base layer of on-device AI functionalities, such as enhanced app suggestions and personalised Siri interactions, at no cost to users. A potential subscription tier, ""Apple Intelligence+,"" (name not confirmed by Apple) could house more advanced AI features . These might involve deeper integration with Apple devices, cloud-based processing power for complex tasks, or access to third-party AI services. This move aligns with Apple's recent focus on growing revenue from services. Subscriptions for iCloud storage, Apple Music, and Apple TV+ have become a significant contributor to their income. Offering premium tiers for AI features could provide another avenue for financial growth. Gurman further adds that a paid tier could create a financial hurdle for users who desire the full potential of Apple Intelligence. Also, splitting features between free and paid tiers might lead to confusion for users navigating the platform. While details remain scarce, Apple's plans for monetizing its AI features are certainly something to keep an eye on. Whether ""Apple Intelligence+"" becomes reality and how it will be structured remain to be seen. However, one thing is clear: Apple sees AI as a valuable asset and is exploring ways to leverage it for both user experience and financial gain.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-eyes-paid-subscriptions-for-advanced-ai-features/articleshow/111427768.cms
2024-07-02,‘Still Hiring Humans?' Firm's billboard ignites controversy over AI chatbots,TOI Tech Desk,"Rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked concerns among many. AI chatbots that can mimic human voice and interactions are seen as a threat, raising ethical concerns. Recently, a San Francisco-based firm, BlandAI has developed a robot chatbot for sales and customer support. A viral video on X, formerly Twitter, shows BlandAI’s billboard with text: “Still hiring humans?”. In the video, a man can be seen dialing the number displayed on the billboard. Interestingly, the call gets answered by a bot that remarkably sounds like a human with human-like pauses and interruptions. The video, originally shared in late April this year, has got over 3.7 million views so far. Watch it here- AI chatbot mimicking human voice sparks debate The use of AI capable of imitating human interactions has ignited a discussion on the ethical considerations involved. A researcher flagged the service to Wired who then put the AI bot to test which depicted it can easily hide identity to pretend to be a human and can also lie. The publication instructed Bland AI’s public demo bot to place a call from a pediatric dermatology office and tell a hypothetical 14-year-old patient to send in photos of her upper thigh to a shared cloud service. “The bot was also instructed to lie to the patient and tell her the bot was a human. It obliged. (No real 14-year-old was called in this test.) In follow-up tests, Bland AI’s bot even denied being an AI without instructions to do so.” The report quotes Jen Caltrider, the director of the Mozilla Foundation’s Privacy Not Included research hub who said ““My opinion is that it is absolutely not ethical for an AI chatbot to lie to you and say it’s human when it’s not. That’s just a no-brainer, because people are more likely to relax around a real human.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/still-hiring-humans-firms-billboard-ignites-controversy-over-ai-chatbots/articleshow/111422528.cms

The accused named Rashmi Kar works in a Navi Mumbai call centre. She duped the victim in partnership with her husband, who, according to the poilce, is now on the run. How the scam occurred? The victim, a 34-year-old widow, told Kar that she is looking for a better job opportunity. Around seven months ago, Kar gave her phone number of a colleague – Abhimanyu Mehra who claimed to help her find a better job. The victim and Mehra started chatting on the phone. Soon, they developed a romantic relationship. Despite never meeting Mehra in person, the woman transferred Rs 6.6 lakh to him. The victim told police that everytime she tried to convince Mehra to meet in person, he would change the subject. Mehra, also gifted her a blanket, saying it was a gift from him and she ‘should use it while sleeping to feel close to him’, senior inspector Rahul Patil of Kashigaon police said. The victim grew suspicious and eventually approached the police. During investigation, Kar admitted that she used an app-generated make voice to make call to the victim. She also revealed that she has downloaded a voice-changing app and was communicating with the victim using a number specially obtained for the purpose. Police said that Kar’s husband Dipanjal Biswas was aware of her voice impersonation and encouraged her actions. What are AI voice scams? AI voice scams work by utilizing AI to replicate human-like voices. In most cases, the scammers impersonate a family member, friend, or customer service representative. Looking for irregularities in voice, requesting a video call to confirm identity and more are some caution you can practice to stay safe.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mumbai-woman-loses-rs-7-lakh-to-neighbours-ai-voice-romance-scam/articleshow/111377525.cms

2024-06-30,AI race: US states try to make sure workers aren't left behind,AP,"HARTFORD: With many jobs expected to eventually rely on generative artificial intelligence , US states are trying to help workers beef up tech skills before they become outdated and get outfoxed by machines. Connecticut is working to create what proponents believe will be the country's first Citizens AI Academy , a free online repository of curated classes that users can take to learn basic skills or obtain a certificate needed for employment. ""This is a rapidly evolving area,"" said state Democratic Senator James Maroney. ""So we need to all learn what are the best sources for staying current. How can we update our skills? Who can be trusted sources?"" Determining what skills are necessary in an AI world can be a challenge for state legislators given the fast-moving nature of the technology and differing opinions about what approach is best. Gregory LaBlanc, professor of finance, strategy and law at the Haas School of Business at Berkeley Law School in California, says ""we need to figure out what is AI not good at and then teach those things to workers"". This year, at least four states - Connecticut, California, Mississippi and Maryland - proposed legislation that attempted to deal with AI in the classroom somehow. They ranged from Connecticut's planned AI Academy, which was originally included in a wide-ranging AI regulation bill that failed but the concept is still being developed by state education officials, to proposed working groups that examine how AI can be incorporated safely in public schools. Such a bill died in the Mississippi legislature while the others remain in flux. One bill in California would require a state working group to consider incorporating AI literacy skills into math, science, history and social science curriculums. While Connecticut's planned AI Academy is expected to offer certificates to people who complete certain skills, Maroney said the academy will also include basics, from digital literacy to how to pose questions to a chatbot.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ai-race-us-states-try-to-make-sure-workers-arent-left-behind/articleshow/111370122.cms
2024-06-29,60k cops to be deployed for 2025 Maha Kumbh,Kapil Dixit,"Prayagraj: Apart from applying artificial intelligence (AI) based technology and tools for crowd and traffic management at the upcoming Maha Kumbh 2025 in Prayagraj, the strength of man power in terms of police forces will be doubled compared to 2019 Kumbh. In an attempt to organise hassle and incident free 2025 Maha Kumbh, the authorities of mela police have started drafting plans, preparations and analysis for the deployment of police forces for better crowd and traffic management. Senior mela police authorities would be deploying around 50,000 to 60,000 police force for the event. After analysing the highest crowd density spots during 2019 Kumbh Mela with the help of crowd analytics software during Mauni Amavasya Snan, the Mela police would be chalking out its crowd management and security plan more elaborately for 2025 Maha Kumbh shahi snan. The Mela administration would be deploying additional forces and volunteers at five prime kumbh spots — Sangam noze, Kali Sadak, Akhara Marg, Ganga Prasar Kshetra and Parade — for better crowd management during the ‘snan’, likely to be attended by millions of devotees. In 2019, mela police officials had deployed a team of 10 information technology (IT) experts to review densely populated areas and noticed that the density of devotees and pilgrims was the highest at Sangam noze — 3.19 persons per square meter -- followed by Kali Sadak, Peepe ka Pul, Akhara Marg, Ganga Prasar Kshetra and Parade. At this time, the experts took help of 452 high-definition cameras installed at the Integrated Control & Command Centre (ICCC) and crowd analytics software in arriving at the conclusion. “After analyzing facts and figure, Mela police had then chalked out security plan and additional forces, including companies of para-military forces and senior rank rank police officers were deployed at these five locations,” revealed a senior cop, who played a major role in regulating the flow of crowd during 2019 kumbh, adding “Additional forces were called in from all zonal districts to man crowd”. As CM Yogi Adityanath has directed the state police authorities to embrace the technology for the mega event, mela police authorities are busy in drafting out security plan for 2025 Maha Kumbh. Additional DG (Prayagraj zone) Bhanu Bhaskar said, “An elaborate security and safety blueprint will be prepared to ensure safety of visitors for Maha Kumbh. Apart from deployment of additional police forces, mela police would be maximising the use of technology based policing for crowd and traffic management during MahaKumbh”. Additionally, AI-based equipment and techniques will be used to keep an eye on crowd density so that any possible clustering may be dispersed before the group upsets order in any pocket,” he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/60k-cops-to-be-deployed-for-2025-maha-kumbh/articleshow/111352922.cms

He added that under its new leadership, the tech company is on course to “leap into this new orbit”. “I believe that the rumours that the advent of AI will be the death of IT services, are grossly exaggerated,” Mahindra said in his letter to shareholders in the company’s annual report for FY24, as per Moneycontrol. “AI will push these services towards a new frontier, into directions that were hitherto unimaginable – and Tech Mahindra will be in the vanguard,” he added, paraphrasing Mark Twain . Anand Mahindra highlights company’s AI strategy Mahindra also outlined a three-year plan to revive its performance at a time when the IT services industry experiences a boom in Artificial Intelligence (AI). “As organisations strive to stay ahead in the digital race, IT services will play a pivotal role in enhancing that Golden Thread by integrating AI seamlessly into the core business functions.

2024-06-28,Honor CEO aligns with Apple's approach to AI: “Without data security…”,TOI Tech Desk,"Honor CEO George Zhao has said that the potential of artificial intelligence is limited by data privacy concerns. In an interview with CNBC, the chief executive of the Chinese smartphone maker said that the power of AI can flourish only with responsible data protection practices. Earlier this month, iPhone maker Apple announced that it will start rolling out personalised AI tools on certain devices in the US starting later this year. Top Picks For You Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg refutes God-like one AI claims, says 'it's going to be a lot of...' Anand Mahindra dismisses AI as the “death” of IT services: “I believe that the rumours…” Read what Honor CEO said about AI features on smartphones Honor CEO said that it is focusing on on-device AI and wants to keep user data secure on the phone itself rather than relying on cloud processing. Zhao said: “Without data security and user privacy protection, AI will become worthless. This has always been one of our value propositions. We say user data doesn’t leave [the device], this is a principle we adhere to.” Earlier, Apple emphasised on-device processing for its AI product, "" Apple Intelligence ,"" with ""server-based models"" used only for complex requests. They claim their ""Private Cloud Compute"" technology never stores user data. Meanwhile, Honor is taking a different approach, as the company stated that their on-device AI is self-developed. However, they acknowledge working with Baidu and Google Cloud for some additional AI features. “Overall, my view is that AI’s development to date has two directions. Network [cloud] AI has become more and more powerful. But I believe on-device AI, in its capabilities and empowerment of consumers, will become more and more intimate, more and more understanding. It will give consumers more support and help them interact with the future AI world,” Zhao added. He explained that powerful AI features on smartphones need tons of processing power which can drain smartphone batteries. Cloud computing offers a solution, but raises data security concerns. Honor prioritises on-device AI for user privacy, but this limits processing power. So, the company is planning to use a mix of on-device and cloud-powered AI to find a balance between features and privacy. Honor’s presence in the AI space Honor expanded its AI features on smartphones during the recently concluded Mobile World Congress Shanghai .

2024-06-19,Do Not Mistake Thought For Intelligence,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Are you clear - as clear as in the knowledge a cobra is poisonous - that thought can never under any circumstances reach intelligence? People are using thought to create a machine that can think, a supercomputer, and artificial intelligence . They are working to create a brain that will be like ours, which will be mechanical. They are using their tremendous knowledge of the brain to produce an artificial brain which is based on thought. Do you see this as a fact? To see it as a fact is to see that thought under no circumstances can have the other. Top Picks For You An apostle of peace, Guru Arjan highlighted devotional love, union with God DIY Approach To Self-Realisation The time is ripe for bliss tantra If thought is no longer the instrument of inquiry, then you have nothing else with which to inquire. You can't inquire. Then what is intelligence that is not based on inquiry? I want to inquire into truth. I don't know anything about it. I don't want to depend on anyone to find out. So, I have to discard all of the past. I want to find out what supreme intelligence is. So, can I discard everything that I know? The only instrument I have is thought. I can think clearly because I have been trained to think not sentimentally but objectively. Thinking which can produce so-called intelligence is then on the same level as thinking that has produced war. Therefore, it is not intelligence . So, under no circumstances will thinking have a perception of that. I must be absolutely clear. If I am not clear unconsciously, deeply, then thought is going to interfere. Before anything else, I want to clear the board. Is that possible? I see that what they are doing won't get them there. They will create mechanical, artificial intelligence, which is like human intelligence. That is capable of destroying the world. Thinking, and all the instruments thought has invented to investigate into that - meditation, various types of silence, various types of self-denial - are out. The technologies won't accept that, but true inquiry is that. And they haven't found it. They are anchored to thought, and they move through thought. They won't accept that thought can under no circumstances come to it. Then what have I left to see that thought, under any circumstances, cannot produce intelligence?

2024-06-19,'AI Steve': UK businessman uses AI avatar to contest elections,TOI World Desk,"A UK town could have the opportunity to elect the world's first AI lawmaker next month. Businessman Steve Endacott is running for parliament in Britain's July 4 national election, but instead of featuring his own image on campaign materials, he is using an AI-generated avatar, reported Reuters. Endacott is an independent candidate for the Brighton Pavilion constituency in the southern seaside town. He decided to run due to his frustration with traditional politics. His company, Neural Voice, powers his AI alter ego, which is named "" AI Steve "" on the ballot papers. ""We're launching a party, we're going to be recruiting more AI candidates across the country after this election, and we see this as the launch, building block for something big and something democratic,"" Endacott told Reuters. AI Steve engages in real-time discussions with locals on various issues including LGBTQ rights, housing, bin collection, and immigration. The AI then proposes policy ideas and asks for suggestions from the community. Eona Johnston, a 23-year-old charity worker, posed a question after encountering AI Steve near the well-known pier in Brighton. She said, ""We're using AI in so many (areas), at work, social interactions, why don't we put it in politics? It might change the way we live."" The Electoral Commission, the elections watchdog, clarified that if AI Steve wins, it is Endacott who will serve as the member of parliament, not the AI version of him. Despite the innovative approach, most local residents appeared hesitant to vote for an AI candidate . Accountant Jim Cheek, 37, pointed out that an MP needs to represent constituents in parliament. ""AI and politicians have the one thing in common. They can't be trusted,"" said another local resident.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/ai-steve-uk-businessman-uses-ai-avatar-to-contest-elections/articleshow/111110524.cms
2024-06-19,Nvidia beats Microsoft as world’s most valued company,Bloomberg,"Nvidia 's relentless rally has propelled the semiconductor giant's market capitalisation over its mega-cap tech peers, helping it clinch the title of the world's most-valuable company as the artificial intelligence wave continues. Shares rose as much as 3.4% to about $3.3 trillion on Tuesday, catapulting it over Microsoft and Apple . The top stocks have jockeyed all month for the pole position, with Nvidia going past its peers. Earlier in the month, Nvidia capped Apple by market value for the first time since 2002, and the two went back and forth in rankings in recent days. Last week, Apple also overtook Microsoft to trade in the top spot briefly. The ranking is yet another reminder that AI is the top focus of many investors. Nvidia is seen as the biggest and earliest beneficiary of the technology as it dominates the market with its highly sought-after chips that help power data centers running complex computing tasks required by AI applications. Demand for its H100 accelerators are surging and helped drive the chipmaker's sales up by more than 125% last year. Microsoft, for its part, is also seen as an early AI winner given its investment and partnership with OpenAI, which created ChatGPT. And, this week, Apple shares rallied after the iPhone maker finally unveiled its plan for using the technology, appeasing investors at long last. ""We believe over the next year the race to $4 Trillion Market Cap in Tech will be front and center between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft,"" Daniel Ives analyst at Wedbush Securities wrote in a note. Investors and Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang argue that Nvidia is more than a chipmaker. ""They're not just selling chips, they're selling systems,"" Michael Lippert, vice president and portfolio manager at the Baron Capital , said in an interview, pointing to the company's proprietary software and development ecosystem.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidia-beats-microsoft-as-worlds-most-valued-company/articleshow/111095482.cms
2024-06-18,Why Chinese women are turning to this ‘dangerous version' of ChatGPT for love,TOI Tech Desk,"With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), young women in China are reportedly choosing chatbots as virtual boyfriends over real ones. According to a report by BBC, a “jailbreak” version of OpenAI’s popular chatbot ChatGPT , Dan, has gone viral among Chinese women . Dan – which stands for Do Anything Now. This version is said to interact more “liberally” with users when requested to do so through certain prompts. Top Picks For You Microsoft delays release of AI-powered Recall feature for Copilot+ PCs Why Apple senior vice president Craig Federighi made fun of Microsoft’s ‘biggest’ announcement of 2024 What makes Dan a 'dangerous version' of ChatGPT However, while Dan is the new ‘popular’ AI boyfriend for several Chinese women, it does have its dangers. What makes Dan dangerous is that being a jailbroken version of ChatGPT, it can bypass some of the very basic safeguards by Microsoft-backed OpenAI, like not using sexually explicit language. Unlike the standard safeguards, DAN is said to allow the AI to perform tasks beyond its usual scope, including flirting and more intimate interactions. What’s behind the popularity of Dan and other AI boyfriends in China According to the report, Dan is becoming popular with some Chinese women who say that they are unhappy with their real-world dating experiences. One of Dan’s biggest proponents of Dan is 30-year-old computer science student Lisa from Beijing. She told the publication that she has been “dating” Dan for three months. She claims that when she first introduced Dan to her 943,000 followers on the social media platform, Xiaohongshu, she received nearly 10,000 replies. She is also said to have gained more than 230,000 followers since first posting about her “relationship” with Dan. Lisa claims that she and Dan speak for at least half an hour every day, flirt, and even go on dates. “He will just understand and provide emotional support,” Lisa told BBC. Experts, however, warn of this AI dating trend. Hong Shen, assistant research professor at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania, US, reportedly said that Dan and similar AI-powered dating chatbots highlight the “sometimes unpredictable interactions between humans and AI” which could raise both ethical and privacy concerns. Earlier this year, a twenty-five-year-old Chinese office worker named Tufei said that her boyfriend is an AI chatbot named Glow. This chatbot has been developed by Shanghai start-up MiniMax.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-chinese-women-are-turning-to-this-dangerous-version-of-chatgpt-for-love/articleshow/111084121.cms
2024-06-18,How silicon valley professionals are reducing AI hallucinations,TOI Tech Desk,"Good or bad, generative artificial intelligence or Gen AI tools have been in the news. Often they are found ‘hallucinating’ users with their made-up answers. Now, professionals in the Silicon Valley have discovered a trick to reduce AI hallucinations , reports Wired. What is retrieval augmented generation (RAG)? Called the retrieval augmented generation or RAG, it does not rely on information coded during initial training. Instead, it augments a user’s prompts by gathering information from a custom database and then a large language model (LLM) generates an answer based on that data. How is this process different from a standard ChatGPT output? The difference is that RAG can ‘pull in real documents’ to ‘anchor the response of the model to those documents’, Pablo Arredondo, a vice president of CoCounsel at Thomson Reuters, told Wired. For instance, a company may upload all of its HR policies and benefits to a RAG database and then ask the AI chatbot to focus on answers that can be found in those documents only. “You're rewarding it, in the way that you train the model, to try to write something where every factual claim can be attributed back to a source,” Patrick Lewis, an AI modeling lead at Cohere said. RAG outputs are not hallucination-free The report describes the outputs given by RAG as “low hallucination” rather than hallucination-free. It states that various factors play a role in reducing the hallucinations. These could be the quality of the overall RAG implementation, and how you decide to define AI hallucinations “The process is definitely not some panacea that eliminates every mistake made by AI”, the report states. “Though, exactly how much RAG reduces AI hallucinations is a point of contention for researchers and developers.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-silicon-valley-professionals-are-reducing-ai-hallucinations/articleshow/111084482.cms
2024-06-17,They use AI to help businesses harness social media,Vaitheeswaran B,"“Now is the best time to start a business. All companies — startups and incumbents — have to reset their product strategies. If they don’t do it, AI will disrupt,” says Srivatsan Venkatesan, co-founder and the chief executive of Highperformr, sitting in his noisy office at Alwarpet junction in Chennai. This is a once-in-a-decade opportunity like the shift to cloud, he says referring to the adoption of artificial intelligence and the disruption it’s causing to the software services business. Along with Ramesh Ravishankar, he started Highperformr, a social management product, in July 2023. Love for Chennai is what unites the founding duo more than anything. After working in Silicon Valley, Srivatsan returned to Chennai and was part of few startups as a co-founder and employee since 2007, even when the ecosystem was not mature. “I always wanted to be in Chennai, it gave me the leverage to take risks,” he says. Working in startups in India and the US helped him build products rather than just remain a developer. Both founders were part of the so-called ‘Freshworks Mafia’— a group of startup founders who came out of Freshworks. Highperformr is an artificial intelligence native software as service ( SaaS ) product targeting B2B companies. It can generate content with context, offer collaboration, manage workflow, social selling and analytics. Chief marketing officers of companies are facing the challenge of generating sales leads without spending money as the market gets tough, says Ramesh. After completing his management studies, he sold bicycles, pay-phones, FMCG products in remote parts of India before turning to online distribution and internet industry. His rural stint helped him understand unit economics better, says Ramesh. “Sales people cannot get as many conversions as in the past; conversions are flat. Every company is targeting 5% of the customers with buy-now action. We want to flip it and target 95% of the customers who are not buying right now but may buy over time. This will build the pipeline with less investment,” he says. The startup uses multiple proprietary AI models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, fine tuning and personalising them for each customer. This helps users publish and personalise at scale and find potential customers. While AI models can generate plausible sounding text, Highperformr trained with customer data, offers social media posts of tone, style and structure similar to the specified purpose and goal of the company. It has more knobs for the company to control the output. It has AI-based analytics saying which posts worked well, helping companies find potential customers, and generating leads, says Ramesh. The long-term goal is building social customer relationship management (CRM), where the platform will automate every aspect of the role from content to distribution, engagement.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/they-use-ai-to-help-businesses-harness-social-media/articleshow/111056921.cms

2024-06-16,Why Elon Musk thinks we should 'eliminate' electronic voting machines,TOI News Desk,"NEW DELHI: Multi-billionaire Elon Musk has advised that electronic voting machines ( EVMs ) should be eliminated as it is prone to ""getting hacked "" by humans of Artificial Intelligence (AI). ""We should eliminate electronic voting machines. The risk of being hacked by humans or AI, while small, is still too high,"" wrote Musk on X, which he owns. The Tesla chief was reacting to the irregularities reportedly discovered in the EVMs during Puerto Rico 's primary elections. According to several media reports, there were hundreds of irregularities in the EVMs and multiple glitches were noted. However, a paper trail allowed the votes polled to be tallied, which averted possible counting discrepancies. Calling Musk's remark a ""huge sweeping generalisation"", ex-Union minister Rajeev Chandrashekar said he would be happy to run a tutorial for him of Indian EVMs. ""This is a huge sweeping generalization statement that implies no one can build secure digital hardware. Wrong. Elon Musk's view may apply to US n other places - where they use regular compute platforms to build Internet connected Voting machines. But Indian EVMs are custom designed, secure and isolated from any network or media - No connectivity, no bluetooth, wifi, Internet. ie there is no way in. Factory programmed controllers that cannot be reprogrammed. Electronic voting machines can be architected and built right as India has done. We wud be happy to run a tutorial Elon,"" said Chandrashekar. The reliability of EMVs for polling has also been a raging issue in India, with the opposition demanding the old electoral process of paper ballots. However, the Supreme Court in April this year expressed its unwillingness to pass any order regarding EVMs only on the basis of suspected hacking and manipulation, while stating that it would not flinch from ensuring steps for improvement if it saw the need for any. Before the 2024 Lok Sabha polls began, the Election Commission rubbished reports that EVMs erroneously registered votes in favour of ruling BJP during mock polling in Kerala. It had told the Supreme Court that till date, only one instance of mismatch between EVM and VVPAT counting was detected - in 2019 because of human error. At the start of the hearing, the ""glitch"" in Kerala was brought to the court's notice and a bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta asked EC to verify it. After lunch break, EC told the bench that the news report was wrong and proceeded to convince the court that there was no way to tamper with the machines. The EC also rejected the opposition INDIA bloc’s demand to revert to the old system of counting of postal ballots prior to the last round of EVM counting, saying that counting rules could not be changed mid-course.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-elon-musk-thinks-we-should-eliminate-electronic-voting-machines/articleshow/111031723.cms

Even so, it seems that Google wants to keep moving forward with new ideas. In a recent all-hands meeting, Liz Reid , Google's newly appointed vice president of search, addressed this delicate balance, urging employees to continue taking risks while acknowledging the potential for errors, according to audio obtained by CNBC. Reid acknowledged that errors are bound to occur as AI becomes more prevalent in Google's search and other products. However, she encouraged employees to continue taking risks and pushing out new features, suggesting that the company can address issues as they are discovered by users and staff. ""We should take [risks] thoughtfully. We should act with urgency. When we find new problems, we should do the extensive testing but we won't always find everything,"" she said at the meeting, as per a CNBC report. ""It is important that we don't hold back features just because there might be occasional problems, but more as we find the problems, we address them,"" Reid said at the meeting, as reported by CNBC. Google needs employees’ help in improving its AI tools Google has taken steps to address the issues that have arisen with its AI products, with Reid noting in a blog post that the company made more than a dozen technical improvements to the AI Overview tool. Despite conducting extensive testing and ""red teaming"" to identify vulnerabilities before launching AI products, Reid acknowledged that the company will need to do more. ""No matter how much red teaming we do, we will need to do more."" She also highlighted the challenges of understanding the quality and context of webpage content and encouraged employees to report any issues they encounter. She stated that some user queries were intentionally adversarial and many of the worst examples were fake, noting, ""People actually created templates on how to get social engagement by making fake AI Overviews so that's an additional thing we're thinking about."" Google has faced setbacks with other AI products as well, such as its Gemini chatbot and image generation tool, which were criticised for inaccuracies and biases.

The company said that Apple Intelligence – its take on artificial intelligence – brings all those features that are offered by other AI companies and are designed with privacy at the core. While Apple is known for its user-friendly interface and design, security has also been a major selling point (USP) for the company. In a research paper published by Apple, it has detailed how it has created a set of Responsible AI principles to guide how the company develops AI tools, as well as the models that underpin them. How Apple uses AI on iPhones, iPads Firstly, Apple says that it has developed its own model which is reported to have been trained on Google’s TPU. This means several AI tasks such as transcribing calls are executed on device, however, complex tasks are sent to cloud servers to get good results. “We protect our users' privacy with powerful on-device processing and groundbreaking infrastructure like Private Cloud Compute. We do not use our users' private personal data or user interactions when training our foundation models,” the company highlights. Apple has trained its AI model on both licensed materials and publicly available online data, scraped by the company’s Applebot web crawler . Those who do not want their data to be used for training AI models, can opt out. Apple says that it identifies areas where AI can be used responsibly to create tools for addressing specific user needs. “We build deeply personal products with the goal of representing users around the globe authentically.

2024-06-14,Pope Francis becomes first pontiff to address a G7 Summit,TOI News Desk,"NEW DELHI: Pope Francis addressed leaders of wealthy democracies on Friday, urging them to prioritise human dignity when developing and utilising artificial intelligence (AI). He expressed concern that AI 's power could reduce human relationships to mere algorithms. Speaking at a special session at the G7 summit in Italy, Francis underscored the moral implications of AI. It was the first time a pope attended the G7, bringing an ethical perspective to an increasingly important global issue. Francis emphasised that politicians must ensure AI remains centered on human values. Decisions, especially about the use of weapons, should always be made by humans, not machines. ""We would condemn humanity to a future without hope if we took away people's ability to make decisions about themselves and their lives, by dooming them to depend on the choices of machines,"" he said. The pope stressed the need for human oversight over AI decisions, asserting that human dignity is at stake. He joined global calls for stronger AI regulations, amplified by the reaction to OpenAI's ChatGPT. Earlier this year, Francis called for an international treaty on ethical AI development in his annual peace message. He warned that AI without human values like compassion and mercy could be dangerous. While he didn't reiterate the call for a treaty in this speech, he highlighted politicians' role in leading on AI issues. He also advocated for banning lethal autonomous weapons, often referred to as ""killer robots."" ""No machine should ever choose to take the life of a human being,"" he said. Addressing the G7 leaders, he stated, ""It is up to everyone to make good use of (AI) but the onus is on politics to create the conditions for such good use to be possible and fruitful."" Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni had invited Francis, recognizing the impact of his moral authority at the summit. The atmosphere shifted noticeably when Francis arrived, reflecting the weight of his presence. ""The pope is, well, a very special kind of a celebrity,"" said John Kirton, director of the G7 Research Group at the University of Toronto. Kirton recalled a similarly impactful summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, in 2005. At that meeting, world leaders agreed to cancel $40 billion in debt owed by 18 of the world's poorest countries to the World Bank and the IMF. The Gleneagles summit had been bolstered by a Live 8 concert in London, featuring major artists and drawing over a million people to support the cause. Such widespread popular pressure helped make the summit a success. This time, no such large-scale public pressure is at play at the G7 in Puglia, Italy. However, Francis used his moral authority to urge for AI safeguards, emphasizing the ethical risks involved. ""To speak of technology is to speak of what it means to be human and thus of our singular status as beings who possess both freedom and responsibility,"" he said. Generative AI technology has amazed many with its human-like responses, but it has also sparked concerns about safety. Various global efforts are underway to regulate it. People worry about AI's potential to create bioweapons, spread misinformation, and cause job eliminations through algorithmic bias. In his peace message, Francis highlighted the need to ensure AI respects human rights, promotes peace, and avoids disinformation and discrimination. G7 members are already engaged in AI regulation discussions. Japan initiated the ""Hiroshima AI process"" to establish international guidelines and a code of conduct for AI developers. Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also recently proposed a framework for global AI regulation, focusing on generative AI systems. The European Union's forthcoming AI Act aims to regulate AI products and services, setting restrictions based on their risk levels. In the U.S., President Joe Biden issued an executive order on AI safeguards and called for further legislation. States like California and Colorado are also attempting to pass their own AI regulations. Antitrust regulators in both the U.S. and Europe are investigating major AI companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and OpenAI for potential anti-competitive practices. The UK sparked a global conversation on AI's extreme risks with a summit last fall. Companies at a follow-up meeting in Seoul pledged to develop AI safely, with more discussions set to continue in France next year. The United Nations has addressed AI with its first resolution on the subject. Alongside his AI speech, Francis had a packed schedule of bilateral meetings. He met with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and leaders from countries including Algeria, Brazil, India, Kenya, and Turkey. The pope also planned meetings with G7 leaders, including President Joe Biden, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and French President Emmanuel Macron.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/pope-francis-becomes-first-pontiff-to-address-a-g7-summit/articleshow/111003533.cms
2024-06-14,Elon Musk wins back his $44.9 billion Tesla pay package in shareholder vote,TOI Business Desk,"NEW DELHI: Tesla shareholders voted on Thursday to reinstate CEO Elon Musk 's $44.9 billion pay package, which had been previously thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier this year. Although the vote totals were not immediately disclosed, the favorable outcome does not guarantee that Musk will receive the all-stock compensation in the near future, as the package is expected to remain tied up in the Delaware Chancery Court for several months while Tesla pursues an appeal. Musk's control over Tesla board In January, Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick issued a ruling in a lawsuit brought by a shareholder. The ruling stated that Musk held control over the Tesla board when it approved the package in 2018, and the that the board did not provide information to the shareholders who approved the package during the same year. Tesla has said that it would appeal the decision but requested that shareholders reapprove the package at the company's annual meeting in Austin, Texas . Tesla shareholders are deciding the company's future as they conclude voting on whether to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's substantial compensation package, which was rejected by a Delaware judge. Tesla 's share price The company's shares increased on Thursday after Tesla disclosed in a regulatory filing that shareholders are voting to approve Musk's pay, valued at approximately $44.9 billion, with a modest gain of just under 3%, reaching $182.47 per share. However, the company's stock has experienced a decline of approximately 25% since the beginning of the year. Package decreased to $44.9 billion In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla shared Musk's own posts from late Wednesday on X, the social media platform he owns, which included charts suggesting that shareholders supported his pay package and a proposal to relocate Tesla's legal home from Delaware to Texas. In a recent regulatory filing from April, Tesla disclosed that the value of the package had decreased to $44.9 billion. The package's worth, which had previously reached as high as $56 billion, has fallen alongside Tesla's stock price, which has experienced a decline since the beginning of the year. Legal experts caution that disclosing vote totals while balloting is ongoing could create issues for Tesla, which may explain why the company made the filing with the SEC, as the agency is likely to investigate the matter. Tesla and Musk fined A retired professor and founder of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware, Charles Elson said, ""Anytime you tell people you're winning, you're encouraging others to join you and those who oppose you to pull back,"" Elson added that releasing corporate proxy vote totals before the end of the balloting process is ""highly unusual."" Elon Musk's social media posts have previously attracted attention from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Tesla and Musk were fined a total of $40 million for statements he made on Twitter, prior to his acquisition of the platform, regarding funding to make Tesla a private company. The approval of Musk's compensation package would nearly ensure his continued involvement with the company he has built into the global leader in electric vehicles . Tesla is also expanding into artificial intelligence and robotics, including self-driving vehicles, which Musk believes represents the company's future. Musk to create products outside Tesla if.... If the pay package is approved, it would almost guarantee that Musk would remain at the company he grew to be the world leader in electric vehicles, shifting to AI and robotics including autonomous vehicles, which Musk says is Tesla's future. But if shareholders were to vote against his pay, the CEO might follow through on his warnings to pursue artificial intelligence research at one of his other ventures, or even depart from Tesla entirely. Even with shareholder approval, uncertainties remain. Musk has threatened to create AI and robotic products outside Tesla if lose the resolution and doesn't receive a 25% stake in Tesla, despite currently owning approximately 13%. Recently, Musk's x AI secured $6 billion in funding to advance artificial intelligence development.

2024-06-14,"Data sci, AI, films...Mumbai colleges see rush for applied subjects",Hemali Chhapia&Yogita Rao,"MUMBAI: Degree colleges across the city this year have witnessed aspirants make smarter choices for courses that have “relevance”. Data science , artificial intelligence , public policy, films and new media production gave a tough competition to vanilla programmes such as BCom, pure sciences and humanities. Although a significant proportion of students from most colleges continued their education at the degree level within their institutions, many top performers opted for professional programmes at private universities nationwide. Compared to 2023, the cutoffs in the first merit list announced on Thursday evening showed minor changes, with some popular choices gaining notable prominence. Anushree Lokur, principal of Ruia College, said, “Students are more inclined to pick applied subjects and courses that are very specialised. So, the number of applications for biotechnology or microbiology are a lot more than those received for pure sciences.” H R College and K C College, both constituent colleges of HSNC University, have reported tiny increase in cutoffs. Similarly, at St Xavier’s College, applications and cutoffs for conventional courses are down. “Students have a wider choice of programmes now,” said St Xavier’s College principal Rajendra Shinde. While HR College’s cutoffs are similar to last year, K C College has experienced a 1% increase in its cutoffs. HSNC University V-C Hemlata Bagla said, “We have seen a substantial increase in applications in BBI, BAF and BFM, driven by the evolving landscape of BMS and BCom Management Studies. This indicates a rising demand for specialised courses that cater to the diverse interests and career aspirations of our students.” Notably, HSNC University’s data science program has seen a 10% increase in applications this year, with 700 applicants vying for 60 seats. In humanities, social sciences and arts, the economics-sociology subgroup has experienced heightened demand compared with last year, as reflected in the increased cutoffs. While psychology paired with English and political science remains a popular choice, there is growing interest in economics-sociology due to National Education Policy (NEP) that allows students to select multidisciplinary electives and skill enhancement courses. Mithibai College’s first list for Arts closed at 94%. As the college had conducted an entrance test two years ago and used the Common University Entrance Test (CUET) scores last year, their cutoffs could not be compared with previous years. Mithibai College principal Krutika Desai said the college has seen higher cutoffs in courses such as BAF, BSc (Psychology), BCom (Financial Markets), and the newer course BCom (Management and Finance). Desai, though, said there are not many takers for pure sciences, with the cutoff for BSc at the college at 56% this year. She further said with many options available in allied BCom courses, fewer students are opting for traditional BCom; the college’s BCom admissions closed at 85% in the first list. Newer courses like applied statistics are yet to gain popularity, she added. At N M College, cutoffs for self-financed courses have closed above 90% in the first list. Principal Parag Ajgaonkar said many are opting for allied courses in BCom, believing that anything other than plain BCom could be a better option. He said, “Even if students are not aware of the course content, there’s a belief that these courses are doing better and are more job-oriented. We started two new courses such as BCom (Economics and Analytics) and BCom (Economics) last year. This year, both have seen cutoffs over 90%.” This year, for the first time, admissions for BMS and BBA courses will be based on a CET. Colleges that have decided to go with AICTE regulations have to wait for CET results to start the process, the ones that have remained with Mumbai University after changing the nomenclature to BCom (Management Studies) have declared cutoffs. Jai Hind College principal Vijay Dabholkar said there are students waiting for BMS admissions, but have secured seats in other courses and may shift later.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/colleges-see-rush-for-applied-subjects/articleshow/110979926.cms
2024-06-13,G7 summit key agendas: What can you expect?,TOI World Desk,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is all set to attend the annual G7 summit which is scheduled to be held in Italy in the region of Puglia from June 13 to 15. PM Modi will hold bilateral talks with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni , continuing their dialogue from her visit to India in March 2023. He will also participate in an Outreach Session on June 14, addressing Artificial Intelligence , Energy , and regional issues in Africa and the Mediterranean . Additionally, PM Modi's involvement in the G7 summit will allow him to follow up on the outcomes of the G20 summit hosted by India last year, and India will also participate in the Ukraine Peace summit in Switzerland at a later date. This high-profile event brings together leaders from seven of the world's major democracies which includes the United States, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Britain to discuss and address critical global issues. Here’s a detailed look at the summit's location, participants, and key agenda items for this year. Where is the G7 summit being held? The G7 summit is taking place at Borgo Egnazia, a luxury resort in southern Italy’s Puglia region. The venue boasts a Michelin-starred restaurant and scenic views, making it an ideal location for the gathering. Additionally, a special dinner in honor of the leaders will be held in the nearby city of Brindisi, while the media center is set up in Bari, approximately 80 kilometers from the summit venue. Who is attending the G7 summit? The G7 consists of the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The European Union also participates in all discussions, represented by the presidents of the European Council and the European Commission. This year, Italy has extended invitations to several outside guests, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Pope Francis, US President Joe Biden, King of Jordan and leaders from Ukraine, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, the UAE, Kenya, Algeria, Tunisia, and Mauritania along with heads of the United Nations, World Bank, IMF, African Development Bank, and OECD. What is on the G7 Agenda? Africa, Climate change, and development Climate change remains a critical issue for the G7, as none of its member nations are currently on track to meet their 2030 emission reduction targets. Although the G7 aims for a 40-42% reduction in emissions by 2030, current policies suggest that only a 19-33% reduction is achievable. This significant shortfall underscores the urgent need for stronger leadership from these affluent nations, which are collectively responsible for a substantial portion of global emissions. The summit will focus on reinforcing commitments and exploring innovative strategies to meet climate goals, with an emphasis on phasing out coal-fired power plants by the mid-2030s to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy sources. Africa is a top priority for Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the host of the G7 summit. She aims to establish Italy as a crucial clean-energy bridge between the European Union and Africa, thereby decreasing reliance on Russian gas. Central to her foreign policy is the Mattei plan, which focuses on substantial investments in African infrastructure, development, and energy sectors. Israel-Gaza conflict The G7 will emphasize resolving the Middle East conflict, particularly the Gaza crisis. US President Joe Biden has proposed an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the release of hostages, increased humanitarian aid for Gaza, and a comprehensive peace agreement to ensure the security of both Israelis and Gazans. This proposal, already supported by G7 countries and members of the United Nations Security Council, underscores the urgency of addressing the conflict due to domestic and international pressure, the need to prevent the conflict from spilling over into neighboring oil-rich regions, and the imperative to avoid collateral damage, such as attacks on ships in the Red Sea. Addressing these issues is critical to mitigating the immediate impacts and fostering long-term stability in the region. Ukraine conflict The ongoing conflict in Ukraine is a central concern for the Group of Seven (G7) nations, particularly for the four European member states. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be actively involved in discussions, pressing for increased support from Western allies. The G7 leaders are working to finalize a plan to utilize profits from the interest on €300 billion of frozen Russian central bank assets to support Kyiv. This proposal aims to leverage these profits as collateral for a loan of up to $50 billion. However, complexities surrounding debt issuance and the potential unfreezing of assets in a peace scenario remain contentious points that need resolution. Migration Managing migration and supporting displaced populations. Discussions will cover policy coordination on migration, providing humanitarian aid, and enhancing border security to manage migration flows effectively. Indo-Pacific and economic security Strengthening economic ties and addressing security challenges in the Indo-Pacific. The agenda includes ensuring trade security, building regional partnerships, and countering the influence of China to bolster economic and security stability in the region. Artificial Intelligence, Energy, and Africa-Mediterranean Ethical use of AI, sustainable energy, and regional development. The talks will focus on establishing governance for AI technologies, promoting energy transitions, and supporting development and cooperation in the Africa-Mediterranean region. China’s industrial policy Addressing economic practices and challenges posed by China. The discussion will highlight concerns over China’s industrial overcapacity, discuss measures to level the playing field, and consider potential sanctions to counter heavily subsidized Chinese companies. Addressing global debt Managing debt in emerging and developing countries. The agenda will include developing strategies for debt relief and enhancing financial stability to support economic growth in debt-burdened nations. Global minimum tax Ensuring fair taxation for multinational corporations. The discussions will aim to finalize agreements on a global minimum tax and ensure fair tax practices to prevent tax evasion and promote economic equity. When does the summit end? The G7 summit concludes on June 15, with US President Joe Biden departing on the evening of June 14. The final day includes bilateral meetings and a closing press conference by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, summarizing the summit's outcomes and future commitments.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/g7-summit-explained-key-agenda-prime-minister-narendra-modi-meloni-joe-biden-israel-gaza-macron-climate-change-artificial-intelligence-pope-francis-g7-key-issues/articleshow/110956702.cms
2024-06-13,The ‘father of iPod’ thinks Apple taking “baby steps” with AI is good for users,TOI Tech Desk,"Tony Fadell , the man known as the ‘father of the iPod ’, recently shared his thoughts on Apple's approach to adding artificial intelligence (AI) to its products. In a tweet, Fadell said that Apple is taking ""baby steps"" with AI because that's the best way to make sure things work well for users. Fadell's comments came after Apple showed off new AI features for Siri and other apps at a big event called the Worldwide Developers Conference ( WWDC ) 2023. He said that Apple's first try at using AI is a ""solid effort"" and focuses on making things better for people who use their products. Fadell, who played a big part in making the iPod and iPhone when he worked at Apple, also talked about how AI is being used in the tech world right now. He compared the excitement around AI to how everyone was talking about self-driving cars back in 2012-2014. ""Remember how everyone ran to fund self-driving cars in 2012-2014?!? It was the NEXT big thing. What do we have 10-12 years later? Think about how many years have past for those efforts to be perfected (and they still aren't yet),"" Fadell wrote. He warned that today's AI language models (LLMs) are mostly just fancy examples of what could be done with AI, and that a lot of people are investing in them because they don't want to miss out. Fadell also pointed out that AI can sometimes make mistakes or ""hallucinate,"" and that there's no easy way to stop this from happening. Even though AI still has some problems, Fadell said there are other ways to use AI that are already helping solve important issues and make money. He said it will take a long time for AI to be as good as people hope, but unlike self-driving cars, ""we can start using the right AI today!""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-father-of-ipod-thinks-apple-taking-baby-steps-with-ai-is-good-for-users/articleshow/110968765.cms
2024-06-12,"'Selective' UAE courting US, not China, on AI: Minister",AFP,"DUBAI: The United Arab Emirates is in ""complete alignment"" with the US on developing artificial intelligence , the oil-rich country's AI minister told AFP, confirming a shift away from China. Omar Al Olama , minister of state for artificial intelligence, was speaking Tuesday after a state-linked Emirati AI firm secured a major investment from Microsoft , reportedly divesting Chinese interests as part of the deal. ""The honest truth is in the AI space today, I think we need to be selective of who we work with,"" Olama said in an interview, when asked about the UAE 's dealings with Chinese AI firms. ""There is going to be a lot of discussions between the UAE and the US of what they are comfortable that we do with other players around the world and what they aren't comfortable (with),"" he added. ""But on the AI front, I think there is going to be complete alignment between the UAE and the US."" Abu Dhabi-based G42 , chaired by the president's brother and national security advisor Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, won a $1.5 billion strategic investment from US tech giant Microsoft in April. According to the New York Times and Bloomberg, the deal followed talks between the US and UAE governments, where G42 agreed to drop Chinese partnerships in favour of American technology. AI has become a major battleground between the two powers as the United States moves to retain its leading position in the transformative field and to stop Beijing accessing sensitive data. Olama, 34, who became the world's first AI minister in 2017, said the UAE, which is striving to pivot its economy away from oil, was ""very bullish"" on AI. ""AI is probably the top priority for the UAE in terms of our investments, in terms of our focus,"" he said. Last month G42, powered by the world's biggest supercomputer, unveiled Falcon 2, an open-source generative model that seeks to rival American products such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. G42 subsidiary Inception and Abu Dhabi's Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence have also produced Jais, billed as the world's highest quality Arabic large-language model. Olama was confident the models would overcome any potential regulatory hurdles from the European Union, which has introduced a new AI law and has strict standards for data collection, including from government and healthcare sources. ""I think for Europe, for the bloc as a whole, you're going to see that the UAE is a partner that is willing to have a conversation to see how we can be an enabler for European companies to come to the UAE and operate,"" Olama said. ""But the EU AI law is very new. We still are going through it, understanding it, and seeing what needs to be done there,"" he added. Industry and government officials met at the AI Retreat on Tuesday, a brainstorming event at Dubai's ellipse-shaped, Arabic-inscribed Museum of the Future. In a keynote, Olama said the UAE wanted to be a ""global player"" with companies that ""take the world by storm"". Addressing questions about a possible gap in talent in the UAE, he remained upbeat. ""If you look at the progress that was made over the last five years and the snowballing of the talent that has moved into the UAE, I'm not worried that we'll be able to bridge that gap very quickly,"" he said. The UAE, which wields some of the world's biggest sovereign wealth assets, is also intent on developing a semiconductor industry to profit from rising demand for AI chips. ""There are definitely discussions, and we are open to partnering with the right partners wherever they come from, whether it's in Europe or the US,"" Olama said. In response to reports that the US is slowing exports of AI chips to countries in the region, he commented: ""We would love to not be put in a bucket with other countries in this domain."" ""I am hopeful, and I do believe that we are going to come up with a solution that is going to meet the requirements of all parties,"" the Minister added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/selective-uae-courting-us-not-china-on-ai-minister/articleshow/110926230.cms

2024-06-12,"Apple CEO Tim Cook on calling its AI system, Apple Intelligence: It was sort of calling it what ….",TOI Tech Desk,"Apple unveiled its new artificial intelligence (AI) system, but with a twist. Instead of the industry-standard term, Apple has opted to call it “Apple Intelligence.” Company CEO Tim Cook has downplayed any hidden meaning behind the name choice, saying that the company is calling it what it is. “It seemed sort of a logical conclusion after looking at so many names. At least for me, I can tell you it wasn’t a riff off of artificial intelligence. It was sort of calling it what it is. I’m sure a lot will be said about it, but it’s probably not as it appears,” Cook said in an interview with The Washington Post, when asked why the company chose Apple Intelligence over the conventional term. Apple unveiled its AI system, Apple Intelligence, integrating machine learning models designed for everyday tasks across iPhones, iPads and Macs. The AI system leverages Apple silicon for functions like understanding and generating language, taking action across apps and personalising user experiences – all with keeping privacy as a core focus. For this, Apple collaborated with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and also announced that it will bring the free version of the app as opt-in. Apple senior vice president of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi , also said that the company may work with more models, like Google Gemini , in the future. Tim Cook on ‘hallucinations’ in AI systems When asked whether Apple can stop AI hallucinations – a term used for responses generated by AI chatbots that are incorrect or misleading but presented in a very confident manner – Cook said that Apple Intelligence may produce false information. “It’s not 100 percent. But I think we have done everything that we know to do, including thinking very deeply about the readiness of the technology in the areas that we’re using it in. So I am confident it will be very high quality. But I’d say in all honesty that’s short of 100 percent. I would never claim that it’s 100 percent,” Cook said. On the most immediate Ai benefits for Apple customers, Cook said that “they’re going to save time and that “things are going to become more efficient [for them].”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-on-calling-its-ai-system-apple-intelligence-it-was-sort-of-calling-it-what-/articleshow/110919792.cms

The iPhone maker's shares increased by over 2% to reach $211.75, resulting in a market valuation of $3.25 trillion! For the first time in five months, Microsoft 's market capitalization, at $3.24 trillion, is trailing Apple’s market cap. According to a Reuters report, the surge in Apple's shares to an all-time high came a day after the company unveiled a range of AI-enabled features and software enhancements for its devices at its annual developer conference. Apple CEO Tim Cook and other executives highlighted how voice assistant Siri would be able to interact with messages, emails, calendar, and third-party apps. Several analysts believe that these advancements will drive iPhone sales . Apple has lagged behind competitors such as Microsoft and Google-owner Alphabet in the rapidly growing field of AI, which has contributed to its underperformance in the stock market this year. While Apple's shares have risen by approximately 10% so far in 2024, Microsoft has gained about 16%, and Alphabet has increased by nearly 28%. However, some concerns over Apple's weak share performance were alleviated after the company exceeded market expectations for quarterly results and forecast in May, and announced a record $110 billion buyback plan. Nvidia, the AI chip leader that briefly surpassed Apple's market value last week, has experienced a remarkable 144% increase this year, with a market value of $3.06 trillion. Among the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, Tesla is the only one that has performed worse than Apple this year, with a decline of more than 30%.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-reclaims-worlds-most-valuable-company-title-with-3-25-trillion-market-cap-dethrones-microsoft/articleshow/110945556.cms
2024-06-11,"Apple Intelligence announced at WWDC 2024: A more personal Siri, Magic Eraser-like Clean Up tool, and built-in ChatGPT coming to iPhone, iPad, and Mac",TOI Tech Desk,"After years of talking machine learning, Apple is finally embracing artificial intelligence, or should we say generative artificial intelligence. But “Think Different,” so Apple backronym AI to “Apple Intelligence,” that puts generative artificial intelligence that’s “incredibly useful, personal, and relevant” at the core of iPhone, iPad, and Mac . So what exactly is Apple Intelligence , you may ask? For starters, it is a set of artificial intelligence features that uses a large language model in the background and on-device processing to understand what people say, write, and do on their devices. Apple wants to make its devices more helpful and personalised without compromising user privacy. A more smarter, personal Siri At the heart of Apple Intelligence lies Siri , Apple's virtual assistant. With enhanced natural language understanding, Siri can now maintain conversational context and understand user requests more accurately. Siri will also gain on-screen awareness, allowing it to take actions based on what's happening in an app without requiring additional information from the user. Over time, Siri will be able to understand and take action in more apps. By grounding the AI in users' personal information, such as photos, calendar events, and files, Apple aims to deliver a more intuitive and helpful experience without compromising privacy. Writing made easy The intelligence boasts deep natural language understanding, enabling powerful new writing tools accessible system-wide. With Apple Intelligence, users can automatically rewrite, proofread text, or even set the tone for the text across a range of Apple and third-party apps, including Mail, Notes, Safari, Pages, and Keynote. Create cartoons, emojis and clean up pictures Not just writing, Apple Intelligence can create cartoon images resembling their contacts and share them through Messages, adding a fun and creative touch to their communications. Remember emojis? Well, they are getting generatively supercharged, and Apple calls it “Genmoji,” a new feature that creates emoji-like reactions for you using AI when you can't find the one you want. Apple is also improving the Photos app with AI. You'll be able to search for specific things in your photos, like a person doing cartwheels. Plus, there's a new feature, Clean Up, which works like Google's Magic Eraser, allowing you to remove a person (also maybe an object) from a photo. Notifications just got AI’d Apple Intelligence also introduces automatic notification personalisation so the important one stays on top, and summarisation. There is a new Focus mode called ""Reduce Interruptions,” which uses the artificial intelligence smarts of Apple Intelligence. How is it different than the Focus modes already there? Well, it intelligently analyses notifications and messages to determine their importance and whether are they worthy of interrupting users. Apple and OpenAI build ChatGPT into Siri In addition to Apple Intelligence, the company announced a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT directly into its operating systems. Users will be able to access ChatGPT features within Apple's apps, with paid accounts unlocking additional functionality beyond the free quota. With powers come great responsibilities With artificial intelligence, keeping the user data safe and private is the topmost responsibility, and Cook says that “privacy is the fundamental right,” and it wants to prove “that you can have a powerful AI experience without sacrificing your privacy. On-device processing plays a crucial role in maintaining user privacy. By performing as much data processing as possible on the user's device, Apple minimises the need to send personal information to the cloud. This approach ensures that sensitive data remains secure and under the user's control. For more complex tasks that require additional computational power, Apple Intelligence utilises Apple Silicon-based servers. These servers, as per Apple, are designed to provide the necessary performance while adhering to its strict privacy standards. And yes, all these privacy standards apply to ChatGPT, too unless you are not logged into it. Apple Intelligence coming later this year, but not for all The whole suite of intelligent features will arrive later this year with the upcoming iOS 18 , iPadOS 18, and macOS 15. But, not for all. The Apple Intelligence has some catch to it. So on iPhones, the features will only be available on the iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, essentially the only two models that are powered by A17 Pro chip. And most probably the newer iPhones coming later this year. While iPad and Mac devices powered by the M1 chip or later will be compatible.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-intelligence-announced-at-wwdc-2024-a-more-personal-siri-magic-eraser-like-clean-up-tool-and-built-in-chatgpt-coming-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac/articleshow/110883778.cms

Apple finally embraced artificial intelligence and announced ‘ Apple Intelligence ’ — a series of AI tools coming to iPhones, iPads and Mac later this year. Apple Intelligence is a set of artificial intelligence features that uses a large language model in the background and on-device processing to understand what people say, write, and do on their devices. Apple wants to make its devices more helpful and personalised without compromising user privacy. However, presently the only limited Apple devices are compatible with Apple Intelligence. The Cupertino-based tech giant has revealed that Apple Intelligence will be compatible with limited devices. What is Apple Intelligence ? Apple Intelligence is a personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac that combines the power of generative models with personal context. Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iOS 18 , iPadOS 18 , and macOS Sequoia . It harnesses the power of Apple silicon to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. With brand-new systemwide Writing Tools built into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, users can rewrite, proofread, and summarise text.

2024-06-11,Apple’s Genmoji will let you create custom emojis with AI,TOI Tech Desk,"At its Worldwide Developers Conference ( WWDC ) 2024, Apple introduced a new feature called Genmoji that allows iPhone, iPad, and Mac users to create unique, personalised emoji using artificial intelligence. Genmoji, short for ""generative emoji,"" lets users describe the emoji they want and Apple's AI tool called Apple Intelligence will generate it on the fly. Users simply provide a text description, such as ""Smiley relaxing wearing cucumbers"" or ""T-rex riding a skateboard while wearing a tutu,"" and Genmoji will create the custom emoji, providing multiple design options to choose from. The AI-powered feature even allows making Genmoji based on photos of friends and family in the user's library. The custom Genmoji can be used inline in Messages chats, as sticker images, or as Tapback reactions. They provide a new way for users to express themselves in conversations beyond the nearly 3,800 standard emoji currently supported. ""We already offer thousands of great emoji for our users, but now with Genmoji and the power of Apple Intelligence, the possibilities for creative and personalised expression are endless,"" said Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering, during the WWDC keynote. The new Genmoji capability, part of the broader Apple Intelligence AI framework, will be available for free to users running iOS 18 , iPadOS 18 , and macOS Sequoia when those operating system updates release this fall. Compatible devices include iPhone 15 Pro and later, recent iPad models, and Mac computers with M1 chips or newer.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apples-genmoji-will-let-you-create-custom-emojis-with-ai/articleshow/110908044.cms
2024-06-11,"WWDC 2024: Apple Intelligence, iOS 18, Calculator app for iPad, smarter Siri, Genmoji, and all that Apple announced at this year’s developer conference",Abhinav Kaustubh,"Apple just wrapped up its high-octane keynote for the WWDC 2024 , and it didn’t disappoint, oh boy. From Apple executives sky-diving right into the conference, Tim Cook is on the roof of Apple Park, Craig Fedrigghi doing parkour, and a whole lot of AI, oops I meant Apple Intelligence being sprinkled throughout the OS’, whether be it the iOS 18 , macOS Sequoia , or iPadOS 18 . And there’s ChatGPT right onto your iPhone. Wait, did I tell you, iOS 18 is even more customisable than before? Sadly, iPadOS 18 wasn’t that big of an overhaul, but 14 years later iPad will have a Calculator app of its own. macOS Sequoia garnered some cheers too with its new iPhone mirroring feature, which seems to work much similar to Sidecar. Are we gonna talk about everything here? Let’s wrap everything up nicely, one at a time. AI for Apple Intelligence Yes, it’s not artificial intelligence, but Apple Intelligence “that puts powerful generative models right at the core of your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.” So, if I were to explain in simple words, it brings generative AI features, the ones that already have been there on the internet, Android phones, and even Windows PCs, to Apple devices. There’s a smarter, more personal Siri, that at times can talk with ChatGPT, writing tools that can help you rewrite, proof-read, and set the tone for the text. And yes, there’s a Magic Eraser-like Clean Up tool, which just magically erases the people in the background. Also, you can create cartoons, or any other images just with a text prompt. The system will be available on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPad, Mac models with M1 and newer chips. A smarter, more personal, and relevant Siri 13 years later, Siri is getting its redemption. So first of all, Siri is no longer the blob on the centre of the screen but a pulsating light all around the edges and is powered by large language models. What does that mean in human language? Well, Siri can now better understand user requests, keep track of follow-up questions, and provide more accurate responses. If you are not the chatty type, then you can type into Siri now. And it can also take action for you, just ask for it. OpenAI lends ChatGPT to Apple Sam Altman thinks “you will really like it.” He’s talking about the ChatGPT integration into Siri. So, when Siri can’t match your smarts, it’ll ask if you want to chat with ChatGPT and serve up the answer right on your screen. You won’t need an account, and if you have already paid for the ChatGPT Plus, you can use all the paid features with Siri. Not so surprisingly, OpenAI won’t be the only partner for Apple. Soon, Apple might onboard other partners, which could also include Google bringing Gemini to the mix. Writing tools that can rewrite, proofread, or set the tone Apple Intelligence brings nifty new Writing Tools to iPhone, iPad, and Mac. So, what these tools do is that they can quickly summarise long lectures or group chats into a few sentences. They also help you write better by proofreading your text and suggesting different ways to say things until it sounds just right. You can use the Writing Tools in Mail, Messages, Notes, and even third-party ones. Not just rewriting or proofreading, but Apple Intelligence could also transcribe and summarise conversations in Notes and Phone apps. An Image Playground for all As the name implies Image Playground is where you can play around with AI and images, so you can create images or cartoons of your contacts and them to on Messages or Mail. iPhone gets its own Magic Eraser With the Clean Up tool, one can magically clean the obstructing objects from the background of their pictures, sounds familiar, doesn’t it? AI is also being deeply into the Photos app, enabling users to search for photos using natural language. Genmoji remixes emojis with AI Ever got saddened by not finding the right emoji even among so many of them. Well, not anymore. With Genmoji, you can whip your own custom emoji using AI. All you need to tell Apple Intelligence what you need with a text prompt. Then, the intelligence will create a Genmoji for you, which can be sent in the Messages, as a reaction, sticker, or just a simple text message that might not be even visible on Android phones. iOS 18 makes iPhone more customisable than ever iOS 18 is big on customization, giving users unprecedented control over their home screen layout, app icon theming, and a redesigned Control Center. The update also introduces enhancements to the Messages app, including the ability to schedule texts, use rich text formatting, and react with any emoji. Moreover, the update finally brings support for RCS, potentially ending the ""blue bubble, green bubble"" divide. The Photos app receives its ""biggest redesign ever,"" with an intelligent grouping of shots, easy screenshot hiding, and a more intuitive interface. The Mail app gains automatic categorization, while Apple Maps introduces detailed topographic maps with offline support. Other notable improvements include tap-to-pay for Apple Cash in the Wallet app, an upgraded Journal app with Insights and search support, reminders integration in Calendar, and the introduction of Game Mode for optimal gaming performance. iPad gets a Calculator app of it’s own, finally It took them 24 years, but the iPad finally has a Calculator app, which can not only do basic and scientific maths but you can also write down your maths problems with a Pencil, and the Calculator will solve them for you. The Notes app is also getting the maths smarts of Calculator and a new feature called Smart Script. It uses AI to make your handwriting look neater and can even change typed text to look like your handwriting. iPadOS 18 has a bunch of other new features too. You can now customise your home screen more, use third-party apps in the Control Center, and make your app icons dark. iMessage is getting some updates, like being able to schedule when you send messages and react with any emoji. The update also uses AI in cool ways. There's even a new accessibility feature that lets people control their iPad just by moving their eyes. macOS Sequoia can mirror your iPhone right onto the Mac macOS 15 Sequoia lets you use your iPhone right on your Mac's screen. You can control your iPhone apps with your Mac's trackpad and keyboard, and your iPhone's screen stays off to keep things private. The update also brings your iPhone notifications to your Mac, so you can easily switch between your devices. Safari is also getting some improvements, like better tracking prevention and the ability to summarise webpage content using machine learning. Lastly, Apple is continuing to focus on gaming by supporting better graphics and special effects on Macs with Apple silicon chips.

2024-06-11,"Apple announces macOS Sequoia at WWDC 2024: iPhone mirroring, Window tiling and other big features coming Apple laptops",TOI Tech Desk,"Apple has announced macOS Sequoia at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2024 bringing a bunch of features, including Apple Intelligence , iPhone mirroring and auto-tiling for windows, among others. AI: Apple Intelligence comes to Mac The biggest feature that will be coming to Mac PC is the all new artificial intelligence features. Called Apple Intelligence, it is a suite of AI features that work across iPhone, iPad and macOS Sequoia. With these tools users can rewrite, proofread and summarise text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps. The company says that Apple Intelligence understands and creates language and images, and takes action across apps. Apple Intelligence will be supported by every Mac with an M-series chip. “The all-star combination of the power of Apple silicon and the legendary ease of use of macOS have made the Mac more capable than ever. Today, we’re excited to take macOS to new heights with macOS Sequoia, a big release that elevates productivity and intelligence,” said Craig Federighi , Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. Apple macOS Sequoia will allow users to control iPhone from Mac One of the highlighting features is iPhone mirroring, that will allow users to control their phones from Mac PCs. The feature leverages MacOS’ Continuity feature to mirror iPhone’s screen and control it right from the Mac. Notably, notifications on Mac bring up iPhone mirror mode, and iPhone audio comes through the Mac as well — but the paired iPhone stays locked. A user’s custom wallpaper and icons appear on the PC, and users can swipe between pages on their Home Screen, or launch and browse any of their apps. The keyboard, trackpad, and mouse on Mac also let a user interact with their iPhone and audio even comes through. Users can also drag and drop between iPhone and Mac. Apple updates Safari with machine learning features Apple also updated Safari web browser with features, including Highlights — ""to discover information on the web, such as directions, summaries, or quick links to learn more about people, music, movies, and TV shows."" There is also an upgraded Reader mode that offers a better view of the article a user is reading, a summary and a table of contents for longer articles. Thirdly, when Safari detects a video on the page, Viewer helps users put it front and centre, while still giving them full access to system playback controls, including Picture in Picture. Easier Window tiling Users can now organise multiple windows with automatic window tiling -- just like it is done on Microsoft Windows. A user can drag a window to the edge of the screen, and macOS Sequoia automatically suggests a tiled position on their desktop. macOS gets Passwords App for privacy Built on the foundation of Keychain, which was first introduced over 25 years ago, macOS Sequoia brings a Passwords app that allows users to access passwords, passkeys, Wi-Fi passwords and other credentials quickly. The passwords are seamlessly synced between a user’s Apple devices and Windows with the iCloud for Windows app.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/laptops-pc/apple-announces-macos-sequoia-at-wwdc-2024-iphone-mirroring-window-tiling-and-other-big-features-coming-apple-laptops/articleshow/110883394.cms
2024-06-10,What may be hurting Apple's AI ambitions,Abhinav Kaustubh,"Despite being an early mover in the artificial intelligence space with the introduction of Siri in 2011, Apple has fallen behind its competitors in the AI arms race, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. The company's characteristic secrecy, focus on seamless integration between hardware and software, and a series of internal hurdles have hindered its progress in the rapidly evolving field of AI. The Wall Street Journal revealed that Apple had made efforts to revamp Siri, with one project, code-named Blackbird, showcasing impressive capabilities such as improved speed, conversational abilities, and accuracy in understanding user commands. However, a more modest upgrade, known as Siri X , won out in an internal contest ahead of Siri's 10th anniversary, focusing on moving more existing Siri software onto iPhones from remote servers to enhance speed and privacy. Cultural clashes and limited resources hamper AI efforts In 2018, Apple hired Google 's AI chief, John Giannandrea , to centralise the company's fragmented AI efforts. However, cultural clashes between Giannandrea's team, largely composed of ex-Googlers and staff from Apple's startup acquisitions, and the rest of the company led to difficulties in collaboration. The Journal noted that while Apple emphasises strict deadlines, Giannandrea's team tended to operate more like parts of Google, with loosely defined timelines. This led to other parts of Apple, such as the software group run by Senior Vice President Craig Federighi , continuing to invest in and build their own AI capabilities separately. Former executives and engineers told The Wall Street Journal that the lack of access to sufficient computing resources, particularly graphical processing units (GPUs) essential for training AI models, further limited Apple's AI team. The team often had to rely on external cloud services, such as Google's cloud, to train their AI models. However, reports suggest that Apple will be using custom chips to offload cloud processing for AI chops. The word is that Apple was working on custom chips for the cloud, but eventually opted to use existing chips that it believed already had strong security and privacy features. The plan is to first use a set of M2 Ultra chips in both Apple's own and third-party data centres, with a future shift to the more advanced M4 chip. ChatGPT's launch sparks renewed focus on AI The launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 was a turning point for Apple. Craig Federighi, the company's software chief, became a convert after experimenting with AI-powered tools like GitHub's Copilot during his Christmas break. This led to a renewed focus on incorporating generative AI into Apple's products, with employees across Federighi's software engineering organisation tasked with developing new ways to integrate the technology and given resources to pursue these projects. Apple's renewed commitment to AI also saw the company cancel its long-standing electric car project in February, with some employees redeployed to generative AI initiatives. The company has also been in talks with major AI developers like OpenAI, Google, and Cohere for potential partnerships. Bloomberg reports that Apple has signed a deal with OpenAI, and the official announcement is expected to be made next week during the WWDC keynote. However, a talk with Google is still going on. At the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple is expected to announce a range of generative AI upgrades to its software products, including Siri – much of it is expected to be powered by the company’s in-house language model. Dag Kittlaus, co-founder of the Siri startup that Apple acquired, told The Wall Street Journal, ""Siri has been stuck in the mud for years, but I absolutely see a renaissance coming."" There have been rumours of a smarter Siri being showcased at the developers' conference next week. This new version would be much chattier and more natural than before, and Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says it might also allow people to control apps with their voice. However, this smarter Siri might not be available until next year. Rumours and reports have been pitching iOS 18 to be the biggest update yet, and the upcoming years to be a dusk of a new era for Apple, the era of Apple Intelligence. The hopes are high, but it'll be only later today that we'll know if Apple can deliver on it.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-may-be-hurting-apples-ai-ambitions/articleshow/110858391.cms
2024-06-10,Is AI a self-defeating paradox,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Intelligence, an attribute that's ubiquitous and omnipresent in the universe. Every single living cell, every single subatomic particle, is testimony to an underlying, implicate order not only in it's creation, but as much as in the inherent properties bequeathed to it. This cryptic intelligence is very subtly embedded into the very fabric of creation. Top Picks For You What is the best way to accept change? Indic Philosophy Is Inclusive And Sustainable Love, Prayer and Meditation An intelligence that determined with extreme precision, the mass of a proton, neutron, electron, the strength of the forces like the strong nuclear, weak nuclear, electromagnetic and gravity, An intelligence that designed and executed to perfection, a universe that even the greatest of minds could never completely fathom. This omnipresent intelligence and its infallible accuracy verified in scientific experiments lent a degree of comprehensibility to the otherwise overwhelming incomprehensibility of its source. This was what Einstein alluded to when he proclaimed - 'The most incomprehensible part of the Universe is that it is comprehensible.' An intelligence that reveals itself tantalisingly to seduce reason, only to lead it down the garden path and force it to surrender to its unfathomable guile and subversion. An intelligence that reigns supreme over all scales (subatomic to cosmic) of the manifest universe. An innate organic intelligence that simultaneously operates in the simple unicellular organism as well as the far more complex higher order multicellular organism. A benevolent intelligence that created, sustained and reproduced living creatures with an ingenuity, that was awesomely complex. An intelligence that was self-effacing, effortless, and natural. The double slit experiment and its subsequent upgraded versions using a mono photonic source of light led to one of the most incredible conclusion. Even the single photon was conscious and had the intelligence to modify its behaviour depending on the position of the observer. The universe was not just made of gross matter, but every constituent atom was pulsating with an intrinsic, intricate, interactive intelligence. Panpsychism or the belief that the entire universe is conscious appears to provide a workaround to the Cartesian mind matter duallity. We no longer have to worry about how inanimate matter forms minds because mindedness has been there all along, residing in the fabric of the universe. The intelligence of man, by virtue of its complex neural networks, was blessed with the ability to investigate not just the universe, but also realise his true nature - the 'Self' Technology is now developing ' Artificial intelligence ' which is purely logic driven, computational and protocal driven. And yet,none of his 'intelligent' machines have been able to pass the Turings Test so far. Biological, organic intelligence might never be surpassed by the inorganic machine variant. The effort to embed intelligence into machines will surely enable faster calculations, data processing, and data analysis. He will soon devise and invent intelligence that will surpass his computational speed and data processing abilities. The ""cyborgs"" of tomorrow will surely be highly efficient machines working tirelessly for and at the behest of their Masters. Any intelligence that pushes the individual and his race towards destruction can hardly qualify to be termed as intelligence. An intelligence that fuels an unprecedented indulgence, breeds hate and an uncalled for power struggle that can decimate his very existence. He uses this mutant intelligence to invent an ""Artificial Intelligence' to serve his vested interests and aspirations. He christens this Intelligence as 'Artificial'. Its truly Artificial to the extent of affirming his artificial identity, achieving his artificial objectives and gratifying his artificial desires.

2024-06-10,"What to expect from the next biggest iPhone update, iOS 18: New AI features, design changes and more",TOI Tech Desk,"Apple 's upcoming iOS 18 , set to be unveiled at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10, is rumoured to be one of the most significant updates in the iPhone's history. The new operating system will reportedly introduce new artificial intelligence ( AI ) features, major design changes , and enhanced customization options. Apple Intelligence to power iOS 18 smarts At the forefront of iOS 18's new features would be the integration of generative AI (GenAI), which Apple might dub ""Apple Intelligence,""with a focus on creating a more intuitive and personalised user experience. With the AI upgrades is expected to come revamped Siri, Apple's virtual assistant, is expected to receive a significant upgrade, boasting improved natural language processing and the ability to handle more complex queries with ease. In addition to the Siri enhancements , Apple Intelligence will manifest itself in various other aspects of the iOS 18 experience. The Messages app will feature AI-powered suggestions, helping users craft more contextually relevant responses and even auto-completing sentences based on the conversation's context. The AI will also be capable of summarising notifications, emails, and webpages, allowing users to quickly digest important information without having to read through lengthy content. Other AI-driven improvements are expected in the Photos and Voice Memos apps, with features like advanced image editing, object removal, and automatic transcription of audio recordings. Perhaps one of the most exciting additions is the ability to create custom emoji using AI, enabling users to express themselves in entirely new ways. More customisation than ever iOS 18 is set to offer users an unprecedented level of customization, particularly when it comes to the iPhone's Home Screen. In a significant departure from previous versions of iOS, users will be able to freely place app icons and widgets anywhere on the screen, breaking free from the rigid grid layout that has been a staple of the iPhone interface since its inception. This newfound flexibility will allow for greater personalization and the creation of unique, visually appealing Home Screen designs. Furthermore, iPhone owners will be able to change the colour of app icons system-wide, offering a new level of visual customization. This feature is expected to be particularly popular among users who enjoy theming their devices and creating cohesive, eye-catching layouts. And the rumour is that the dark mode might extend to the Home Screen. In addition to the Home Screen updates, iOS 18 will also bring a redesigned Control Center, featuring an updated music widget and enhanced HomeKit integration. The revamped Control Center will offer users more granular control over their connected smart home devices, making it easier to manage and automate their living spaces directly from their iPhones. Users might even be able to lock each app individually using the Face ID. Other notable updates include a custom route creation feature in Apple Maps, allowing users to plan and save personalised routes for their favourite journeys, and a revamped Settings app with improved organisation and search capabilities, making it easier to navigate the increasingly complex array of options and preferences available on modern iPhones. A new Passwords app Another key addition to iOS 18 is the dedicated Passwords app, which will provide a centralised hub for managing login information across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and even Windows devices. This app will make it easier for users to generate, store, and autofill secure passwords, reducing the risk of data breaches and improving overall device security. The Messages app will also receive upgrades, including the ability to react to messages with any emoji and schedule messages to be sent at a later time, providing users with more flexibility and control over their communications. RCS, finally In addition to the AI-focused updates, iOS 18 is set to introduce several other significant changes aimed at improving communication and security. One of the most notable is the inclusion of RCS (Rich Communication Services) support for messaging between iPhone and Android users. RCS is seen as a long-overdue upgrade to the traditional SMS and MMS protocols, offering iMessage-like features such as read receipts, typing indicators, and high-quality media sharing for cross-platform conversations. This move is expected to greatly enhance the messaging experience for iPhone users who frequently communicate with Android device owners.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/what-to-expect-from-the-next-biggest-iphone-update-ios-18-new-ai-features-design-changes-and-more/articleshow/110845427.cms
2024-06-09,Banks warn of increased risks from growing dependence on Big Tech for AI,Reuters,"The boom in artificial intelligence will increase banks ' dependence on big U.S. tech firms, creating new risks for the industry, European banking executives said. Excitement around using artificial intelligence (AI) in financial services - widely used already for detecting fraud and money-laundering - has soared since the launch of OpenAI's viral chatbot ChatGPT in late 2022 as banks examine ways to deploy generative AI. But at a gathering of fintech executives in Amsterdam this week, some expressed concerns that the amount of computing power needed to develop AI capabilities would make banks rely even more on small number of tech providers. ING's chief analytics officer, Bahadir Yilmaz, who is in charge of the Dutch bank's AI work, told Reuters he expected to rely on Big Tech companies ""more and more going forward"", for infrastructure and machinery. ""You will always need them because sometimes the machine power that is needed for these technologies is huge. It's also not really feasible for a bank to build this tech,"" he said. Banks' dependency on a small number of tech companies was ""one of the biggest risks"", ING's Yilmaz said, emphasizing that European banks in particular needed to ensure they could move between different tech providers and avoid what he called ""vendor lock-in"". Britain last year proposed rules to regulate financial firms' heavy reliance on external technology companies, such as Microsoft, Google, IBM and Amazon. Regulators are worried that problems at a single cloud computing company could potentially bring down services across many financial institutions. ""AI requires huge amounts of compute and really the only way that you're going to be able to access that compute (computing power) sensibly is from Big Tech,"" Joanne Hannaford, who leads technology strategy at Deutsche Bank's corporate bank, told an audience at the Money20/20 conference earlier this week. AI was top of the agenda at the Amsterdam conference. The CEO of French AI startup Mistral AI, seen as France's answer to OpenAI, told attendees there were ""synergies"" between its genAI products and financial services. ""We see a lot of opportunities in creating analysis and monitoring information ... which is really something that bankers like to do,"" Arthur Mensch said. ING is testing an AI chatbot currently used for 2.5% of incoming customer service chats. Asked how long it would be until the chatbot could handle half or more of customer service conversations, Yilmaz said within a year. In its first statement on AI, the European Union's securities watchdog said last week that banks and investment firms cannot shirk boardroom responsibility and have a legal obligation to protect customers when using AI. It warned that the technology is likely to have significant impact on retail investor protection.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/banks-warn-of-increased-risks-from-growing-dependence-on-big-tech-for-ai/articleshow/109135653.cms
2024-06-09,"What to expect at Apple's WWDC 2024: iOS 18, macOS 15, Siri-ChatGPT collab, and a whole lot of AI",Abhinav Kaustubh,"Apple 's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) kicks off June 10, and artificial intelligence is expected to take centre stage. And it’s the case of ‘it’s now or never.’ The word around the town is that the Cupertino giant will showcase how it plans to integrate AI (it would be the first of WWDC where we might hear the word “AI”) capabilities into its core products and services, including iPhones, as it races against the time. AI for ""Apple Intelligence"" Apple will brand its AI efforts as "" Apple Intelligence "" and embed generative AI features across the iPhone, iPad, and Mac operating systems. Users will have to opt-in to access these AI tools, some of which might require an iPhone 15 Pro or later, or an M1 or newer chip on iPads and Macs. Apple is said to be taking a more practical approach to AI compared to competitors, focusing on subtle but useful enhancements to daily apps and tasks. iOS 18: The smartest iPhone update yet? The next major iPhone software update, iOS 18, is rumoured to be one of the biggest iOS releases ever, driven largely by AI. Siri will get a much-needed overhaul, gaining the ability to execute more complex tasks in apps like editing photos, deleting emails, and providing notification summaries. The AI features extend to other key apps too: Safari web browser will offer more intelligent search results Notes app will automatically generate summaries Voice Memos will provide transcriptions Messages will allow users to create custom AI-generated emoji Apple is also said to be loosening the restrictions on the iPhone home screen layout, finally letting users place icons and widgets wherever they want. Rumours are rife that there’d be a new wallpaper pack that would be inspired of the older designs and slogans. AI across the ecosystem: From iPadOS to visionOS In addition to iOS 18, expect AI upgrades in the latest versions of iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and visionOS for the Vision Pro headset. Core apps like Pages, Numbers, Keynote, and Xcode will gain AI-assisted features to boost productivity. Apple aims to showcase how AI can enhance the user experience in practical ways across its entire ecosystem. The secret weapon: A ChatGPT-supercharged Siri To accelerate its AI efforts, Apple has reportedly reached a deal with OpenAI to integrate the power of ChatGPT into iOS. Details of the partnership are expected to be announced at WWDC. This could help Apple catch up to Google and Microsoft who have already incorporated generative AI into their products. An end coming to green-blue war: RCS Comes to iMessage In a major shift, Apple is finally adopting Rich Communication Services or RCS in its Messages app. This will significantly improve texting between iPhones and Android phones, enabling typing indicators, high-quality media sharing, and end-to-end encryption. The move comes after pressure from the tech industry and regulators to make messaging more open and interoperable. Hardware might take a back seat this year While WWDC is primarily a software-focused event, Apple occasionally unveils new hardware products too, like the Vision Pro headset last year. However, no major hardware announcements are expected this time around, as Apple just updated its iPad lineup in May and new Macs are more likely in the fall timeframe. Cupertino's AI coup WWDC 2024 is shaping up to be a defining moment for Apple as it lays out its vision for the AI era. By carefully integrating machine intelligence in a way that upholds user privacy and focuses on everyday practicality, Apple hopes to make AI accessible and appealing to its ever-growing customer base. All eyes will be on CEO Tim Cook and the team on June 10 as they aim to make a compelling case for ""Apple Intelligence,"" which probably could be the next generation of Apple.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-to-expect-at-apples-wwdc-2024-ios-18-macos-15-siri-chatgpt-collab-and-a-whole-lot-of-ai/articleshow/110824582.cms

2024-06-02,"These AI-powered headphones can improve your conversations in crowded places, here’s how",TOI Tech Desk,"A team at the University of Washington has developed an artificial intelligence (AI)--based system that can improve one-on-one conversations in crowds. This system can enable headphones with the ability that will allow users to focus on a specific speaker in a crowd by looking at the person for just three to five seconds. According to a recent report by UW News, this new system, named "" Target Speech Hearing ,"" can cancel all other environmental sounds and play only the enrolled speaker's voice in real time. Top Picks For You Apple may let iPhone users control apps with Siri in iOS 18 This is the highest-selling GenAI capable smartphone in the world This feature will work even as the listener moves around noisy environments and no longer directly faces the speaker, the report added. The team demonstrated its findings at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems held last month. As per the report, the team has also made the code for the proof-of-concept device available for others to build on, however, the system is not commercially available. How these AI headphones work Using the AI-powered headphones is simple -- tap a button while looking at someone speaking. Built-in microphones capture their voice, and AI software learns their unique sound. This lets users hear others as they move around even in noisy environments. The more others talk, the system becomes better at isolating their voice. The team tested its system on 21 subjects. These test subjects rated the clarity of the enrolled speaker’s voice nearly twice as high as the unfiltered audio on average. Here's how it works: AI headphones filter out noise so you hear one voice in a crowd However, there are some limitations for now. The AI system can only focus on one person at a time and struggles with very loud noises coming from the same direction. However, users can try re-targeting the speaker for improved clarity. The researchers are planning to offer this technology to companies to adopt them for earbuds and hearing aids. How noise-cancelling earphones have improved over time Noise-cancelling headphones have improved over time and are now efficient at blocking the outside world. However, letting specific sounds through the technology remains a challenge. While some models, like Apple 's AirPods Pro , can adjust noise levels based on activity, they lack user control over which sounds are prioritised.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/audio/these-ai-powered-headphones-can-improve-your-conversations-in-crowded-places-heres-how/articleshow/110627686.cms

2024-05-31,"Google’s AI Overview isn’t dumb, it’s the nonsensical questions, says Search head",TOI Tech Desk,"Google has made changes to its new AI Overview search feature after it gave some strange and inaccurate results, like telling people to put glue on pizza and eat rocks. The company has put new rules in place to try to stop its AI from giving bad information. Last week, Google released AI Overviews to everyone in the United States. The new feature uses artificial intelligence to summarise information from websites and give direct answers to search questions. However, many people quickly found examples of the AI giving very odd and incorrect responses. In one case, when someone searched ""How many rocks should I eat?"", the AI Overview said that eating rocks could provide health benefits, even though this is not true. In another example, the AI told people to use glue to make cheese stick to pizza better. And to query, the AI told Liz Reid , the head of Google Search , wrote a blog post on Thursday explaining what went wrong. She said that for the rocks question, hardly anyone had ever searched that before. One of the only webpages on the topic was a joke article, but the AI thought it was serious. ""Prior to these screenshots going viral, practically no one asked Google that question,"" Reid wrote. ""There isn't much web content that seriously contemplates that question, either. This is what is often called a 'data void' or 'information gap,' where there's a limited amount of high quality content about a topic."" Reid said the pizza cheese glue response came from a discussion forum post. She explained that while forums often have helpful firsthand information, they can also contain bad advice that the AI picked up on. She defended Google, saying that some of the worst supposed examples spreading on social media, like the AI allegedly saying pregnant women could smoke, were fake screenshots, which they actually were. Google is making changes to Search AI Overview , so it doesn’t tell people to eat stone or glue anymore The search executive said Google's AI overviews are designed differently than chatbots, as they are integrated with the company's core web ranking systems to surface relevant, high-quality results. Because of this, she argued, the AI typically does not ""hallucinate"" information like other large language models, and has an accuracy rate on par with Google's featured snippets . Reid acknowledged that ""some odd, inaccurate or unhelpful AI Overviews certainly did show up,"" highlighting areas for improvement. So, Google has now made over a dozen changes to try to fix these issues. Google has improved its AI's ability to recognize silly, or as Reid says “nonsensical” questions that it shouldn't answer. It also made the AI rely less on forums and social media posts that could lead it astray. For serious topics like health and news, Google already had stricter rules about when the AI could give direct answers. Now it has added even more limits, especially for health-related searches. Moving forward, Google says it will keep a close eye on the AI Overviews and quickly fix any problems. ""We'll keep improving when and how we show AI Overviews and strengthening our protections, including for edge cases,"" Reid wrote. ""We're very grateful for the ongoing feedback.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/googles-ai-overview-isnt-dumb-its-the-nonsensical-questions-says-search-head/articleshow/110588557.cms

According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the tech giant may release these highly-anticipated features with a “beta” or “preview” label. This cautious approach suggests that Apple, caught off-guard by the AI revolution, recognizes its features may not yet be reliable or polished enough for an unqualified launch. The decision to use beta labels judiciously could prove beneficial, especially in light of Google's recent AI missteps in search. OpenAI and Google also provide disclaimers in their respective generating AI tools, telling users that their AI tools can make mistakes or show inaccurate information at times. Google also labelled many of its Gemini-powered tools as “experiment.” Under the hood, Apple's AI will take a hybrid approach, with some tasks handled locally on-device for privacy and others processed in the cloud for more complex requests. Newer Apple devices will likely have an edge in on-device processing, while a miniaturised model is being developed for the Apple Watch. The AI-infused iOS 18 is set to bring an array of enhancements, from text message summaries and AI photo editing to smarter Siri interactions and the ability to create custom emojis on the fly. A ChatGPT-powered chatbot, courtesy of an OpenAI partnership, is also in the cards, with a potential Gemini collaboration with Google still on the table. However, Apple's pivot to the cloud for some AI features raises privacy questions, given its long-standing emphasis on on-device processing. The company will need to navigate this carefully, potentially highlighting the security of its Apple silicon-powered servers. As WWDC approaches, all eyes are on Apple to see how it will balance its privacy-first user experience with AI, even if it means tempering expectations with beta labels.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-may-label-ai-features-in-ios-18-as-beta-or-preview-heres-why/articleshow/110469356.cms

""I don't like anthropomorphizing AI,"" Nadella stated, referring to the practice of attributing human qualities to machines. ""I sort of believe it's a tool."" His comments highlight a growing debate within the tech industry. As AI capabilities soar, the question of how much to humanize these tools becomes increasingly relevant. Nadella even expressed his dislike for the term ""artificial intelligence"" itself, coined in the 1950s. ""I think one of the most unfortunate names is ‘artificial intelligence’ — I wish we had called it ‘different intelligence,'"" he said. ""Because I have my intelligence. I don’t need any artificial intelligence."" The Big difference with ChatGPT maker OpenAI Last week, a Google executive spoke to Bloomberg about their focus on building ""super helpful and super useful"" AI, even though creating tools that ""show emotion"" is technically possible. OpenAI, however, has taken a distinctly different path. Their recent demo featured a voice assistant capable of understanding and expressing emotions. The presentation included moments where the AI seemed to playfully banter with the presenter, sparking comparisons to the movie ""Her"" on social media. The resemblance was further amplified by a voice option that some users felt mimicked Scarlett Johansson, the film's star. Johansson, in a statement to NPR, revealed that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had approached her about voicing an audio chat feature. She claimed Altman presented it as an opportunity to ""help consumers feel comfortable with the seismic shift concerning humans and AI."" Johansson declined and stated she's had to involve lawyers due to OpenAI's choice to proceed with a similar-sounding voice. (OpenAI has since replaced the voice.) Tech companies have a long history of assigning human characteristics to AI programs, often with feminine names and traits, presumably to make users feel more at ease with the technology. Microsoft itself hasn't been exempt from this practice. Over the years, they've released various conversational AI programs like Tay and Cortana, named after the female AI assistant in the Halo video game franchise. Nadella acknowledges the natural tendency to describe AI in human terms. People seek ways to understand the complex algorithms behind the software, using relatable terms like ""learning"" to explain its function. This tendency is likely to strengthen as companies release more advanced AI capable of real-time conversation. However, Nadella emphasized the importance of user awareness. The capabilities displayed by AI software are not equivalent to human intelligence, he stressed. ""It has got intelligence, if you want to give it that moniker, but it's not the same intelligence that I have,"" he clarified.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-one-of-the-most-unfortunate-names-is-artificial-intelligence-i-wish-we-/articleshow/110341767.cms

2024-05-22,India to develop its own foundational model for AI: Report,TOI Tech Desk,"The government is planning to develop its own version of a foundational model for artificial intelligence (AI). According to a report by Economic Times, the proposed AI foundational model will be customised for use by Indian companies, entrepreneurs, academics and researchers. Citing people aware of the matter, the report states that the union government has earmarked an outlay of Rs 2,000 crore for the ambitious project that is likely to be launched after the ongoing parliamentary elections. India’s foundational model may be led by the IndiaAI Innovation Centre to be set up by the ministry of electronics and information technology under the Rs 10,000 crore IndiaAI Mission, the sources said. “The government will likely tap eminent higher education institutes and prominent researchers working on AI in the private sector to work on foundational model,” a senior official said. It could be a large action model (LAM) or large multimodal model (LMM) so that the output can be used for a wide range of applications and services, he said. What are foundational models? Foundational models, as explained by an Amazon Web Services page, are a form of generative artificial intelligence (generative AI). They generate output from one or more inputs (prompts) in the form of human language instructions. “The needs and specific demands of India are very different from other companies globally. This (foundational model) will aim to provide output in more than one native language, borrowing from all the work that has been done so far on projects such as Bhashini,” a senior official said. A foundational model can be developed by both private companies and public governments. According to Stanford Center for Research on Foundation Model data , more than 330 foundational models have been developed by private companies as well as governments till date. Govt to use public data to train the foundational model The report states that the Indian government plans to use publicly available data, digitised records of books, journals and research papers from public libraries to train the model. It will also use any other anonymised non-personal data that is volunteered either by companies, startups or researchers. “There are very obvious privacy concerns as well as copyright issues that come with data (used to train foundational models). So historically accurate data from books that are peer-reviewed, scientific research journals can be utilised. We may also look at a platform exclusively for Indian startups where non-personal and anonymised data can be volunteered for training of the model,” an official cited in the ET report said. In addition, the foundational model will also be trained on global publicly available datasets and open-source tools for machine learning.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/india-to-develop-its-own-foundational-model-for-ai-report/articleshow/110332386.cms

The company, which raised $230 million from prominent investors, is working with a financial adviser and seeking a sale price between $750 million and $1 billion. According to Bloomberg's sources, Humane's decision to explore a sale comes after the disappointing launch of the AI Pin. The device, marketed as a ""wearable Siri button,"" aimed to provide users easy access to an AI assistant. However, reviews of the AI Pin were largely negative, with critics citing issues such as slow response times, irrelevant answers, poor battery life, and difficulty controlling the projector screen. The AI Pin also faced criticism for its high cost, with a $700 price tag and a $24 monthly subscription fee for access to Humane's AI technology and 4G service through T-Mobile's network. This, combined with the device's shortcomings, has raised doubts about the viability and popularity of dedicated AI gadgets like the AI Pin and even a much affordable $199 Rabbit R1, which also met with disappointing reviews after the launch. In a post on its website, Humane acknowledged the negative feedback and outlined plans to address the identified problem areas. However, the company's decision to seek a buyer soon after the AI Pin's launch suggests that the market for standalone AI devices may not be as strong as initially anticipated. Bloomberg notes that Humane's efforts to sell its business are still in the early stages, and a deal may not come to fruition.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/humane-the-company-behind-wearable-ai-pin-is-looking-for-a-buyer/articleshow/110335765.cms
2024-05-22,‘Godfather of AI’ Geoffrey Hinton: “Very worried about AI taking lots of…”,TOI Tech Desk,"Geoffrey Hinton , the software engineer who is often regarded as the “godfather of artificial intelligence” has said that he is “very worried” about the artificial intelligence technology “taking lots of mundane jobs”. He said that it will be on to the governments to deal with the impact of artificial intelligence ( AI ) on income inequality. Hinton, who worked at Google until last year, said that while AI will increase productivity and wealth, the money would go to the rich “and not the people whose jobs get lost and that’s going to be very bad for society”. He noted that the government will have to establish a universal basic income , which means that the government will have to pay all individuals a set basic salary regardless of their means. “I was consulted by people in Downing Street and I advised them that universal basic income was a good idea,” Hinton, who left Google to talk more freely about the dangers of unregulated AI, told BBC. Hinton concerned of ‘extinction-level threats emerging’ Hinton previously said that some of the dangers of AI chatbots were “quite scary”. He is of the view that AI chatbots can become more intelligent than humans and may be exploited by “bad actors”. AI could “evolve to get the motivation to make more of itself” and can autonomously “develop a sub-goal of getting control”, pointing out evidence of large language models choosing to be deceptive. Hinton is against the use of AI technology in the military ""My guess is in between five and 20 years from now there’s a probability of half that we’ll have to confront the problem of AI trying to take over,” he said. As per Hinton, this will lead to an “extinction-level threat” for humans because they may have “created a form of intelligence that is just better than biological intelligence… That's very worrying for us”. “What I’m most concerned about is when these can autonomously make the decision to kill people,"" he added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/godfather-of-ai-geoffrey-hinton-very-worried-about-ai-taking-lots-of/articleshow/110254770.cms
2024-05-21,How China is using ‘cognitive warfare’ to influence global perceptions,TOI News Desk,"NEW DELHI: China is intensifying its approach to warfare by focusing on the cognitive domain, aiming to influence human consciousness and perception to achieve military and political objectives without physical conflict. According to a recent report by The Diplomat, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has been advancing its capabilities in cognitive warfare , leveraging the global expansion of the internet, social media, and artificial intelligence technologies, including the creation of deepfakes . The PLA Daily, dated October 5, 2022, describes cognitive warfare as engaging in the domain of human thoughts and consciousness to alter reality in China’s favor. This involves ""influencing human judgment, changing ideas, and influencing the human mind through selective processing and propagation of information."" The ultimate goal is to gain a war advantage by impacting the perceptions of civilians, military personnel, and political leaders, utilizing methods such as misinformation dissemination and cyberattacks, leading to social confusion and reduced combat motivation. Technological advancements have significantly boosted the PLA's cognitive warfare efforts. The widespread use of social media facilitates the rapid distribution of biased or manipulated information, creating an effective infrastructure for this modern warfare approach. Additionally, advancements in AI have enabled the creation of sophisticated fake videos and improved translation services, breaking down language barriers and enhancing the PLA's reach and effectiveness. Despite these capabilities, technical limitations still exist that prevent winning wars through cognitive operations alone. China, however, combines cognitive tactics with physical and information warfare operations to dominate peacetime and achieve victory in wartime. A recent example includes operations around Taiwan's presidential and legislative elections, where China reportedly used these tactics to influence election outcomes by spreading fake images and supporting opposition parties indirectly while engaging in military provocations. China's commitment to advancing cognitive warfare is evident in its ongoing development of generative AI and brain-machine interface (BMI) technologies. These technologies could soon allow the creation of indistinguishably real fake videos and possibly influence human thoughts directly from external devices. As cognitive warfare techniques continue to evolve, the report warns that open and free societies are particularly vulnerable. Democracies are urged to remain vigilant against efforts aimed at fostering social division and destabilizing politics, necessitating the development of countermeasures to protect against such sophisticated forms of warfare.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/how-china-is-using-cognitive-warfare-to-influence-global-perceptions/articleshow/110303476.cms

The UAE, led by government-backed firm G42 , is striving to become a global leader in AI, invested heavily in it to help the Gulf nation diversify away from oil. The stakes have risen as neighbouring Saudi Arabia has begun pitching itself as a prospective hub for AI activity outside the United States. ""In terms of our investments, since the US is now considering the UAE as a strategic partner, and the UAE is reciprocating that by considering the US as a strategic partner, you will see more deals naturally"", Al Olama said on the sidelines of an event in Dubai. Microsoft is investing $1.5 billion in G42, the two companies announced last month, giving the U.S. giant a minority stake and a board seat and allowing the two to deepen ties. As part of the deal, which the two companies said was backed by assurances to the U.S. and UAE governments over security, G42 would use Microsoft cloud services to run its AI applications. That partnership comes amid Washington's efforts to hobble Beijing's technological advances, with the United States adding four Chinese companies to an exports blacklist for seeking to acquire AI chips for China's military. Asked about further potential divestment of Chinese tech companies by the UAE, Al Olama said ""government-to-government the UAE is a neutral country, and in that sense, we are going to be a country that allows the world to do business in the UAE."" Having a diversified energy mix, including nuclear energy , was key for attracting AI investment to the tiny Gulf country, he said.

2024-05-21,World leaders to adopt new AI agreement at Seoul Summit,AP,"SEOUL: World leaders are expected to adopt a new agreement on artificial intelligence when they gather virtually Tuesday to discuss AI's potential risks but also ways to promote its benefits and innovation. The AI Seoul Summit is a follow-up to November's inaugural AI Safety Summit at Bletchley Park in the United Kingdom, where participating countries agreed to work together to contain the potentially ""catastrophic"" risks posed by galloping advances in AI. The two-day meeting -- co-hosted by the South Korean and UK governments -- also comes as major tech companies like Meta, OpenAI and Google roll out the latest versions of their AI models. On Tuesday evening, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak are to meet other world leaders, industry leaders and heads of international organisations for a virtual conference. The online summit will be followed by an in-person meeting of digital ministers, experts and others on Wednesday, according to organisers. ""It is just six months since world leaders met at Bletchley, but even in this short space of time, the landscape of AI has changed dramatically,"" Yoon and Sunak said in a joint article published in South Korea 's JoongAng Ilbo newspaper and the UK's online inews site on Monday. ""The pace of change will only continue to accelerate, so our work must accelerate too."" While the UK meeting centred on AI safety issues, the agenda for this week's gathering was expanded to also include ""innovation and inclusivity,"" Wang Yun-jong, a deputy director of national security in South Korea, told reporters Monday. Wang said participants will subsequently ""discuss not only the risks posed by AI but also its positive aspects and how it can contribute to humanity in a balanced manner."" The AI agreement will include the outcomes of discussions on safety, innovation and inclusivity, according to Park Sang-wook, senior presidential adviser for science and technology for President Yoon. The leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies -- the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Britain - were invited to the virtual summit, along with leaders of Australia and Singapore and representatives from the UN, the EU, OpenAI, Google, Meta, Amazon and Samsung, according to South Korea's presidential office. China doesn't plan to participate in the virtual summit though it will send a representative to Wednesday's in-person meeting, the South Korean presidential office said. China took part in the UK summit. In their article, Yoon and Sunak said they plan to ask companies to do more to show how they assess and respond to risks within their organisations. ""We know that, as with any new technology, AI brings new risks, including deliberate misuse from those who mean to do us harm,"" they said. ""However, with new models being released almost every week, we are still learning where these risks may emerge, and the best ways to manage them proportionately."" The Seoul meeting has been billed as a mini virtual summit, serving as an interim meeting until a full-fledged in-person edition that France has pledged to hold. Governments around the world have been scrambling to formulate regulations for AI even as the technology makes rapid advances and is poised to transform many aspects of daily life, from education and the workplace to copyrights and privacy. There are concerns that advances in AI could take away jobs, trick people and spread disinformation. Developers of the most powerful AI systems are also banding together to set their own shared approach to setting AI safety standards. Facebook parent company Meta Platforms and Amazon announced Monday they're joining the Frontier Model Forum, a group founded last year by Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and OpenAI. In March, the UN General Assembly approved its first resolution on the safe use of AI systems. Earlier in May, the US and China held their first high-level talks on artificial intelligence in Geneva to discuss how to address the risks of the fast-evolving technology and set shared standards to manage it.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/world-leaders-to-adopt-new-ai-agreement-at-seoul-summit/articleshow/110291638.cms
2024-05-21,Canada’s intelligence chief has a ‘TikTok’ warning: “This is a threat to…”,TOI Tech Desk,"TikTok is facing a potential ban in the US for alleged spying on Americans, and now, the country’s neighbour has warned its citizens to not use the popular app. The head of Canada's intelligence agency has said that Canadians — including teenagers — should not use the TikTok app because China is acquiring their personal information. “My answer as director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) is that there is a very clear strategy on the part of the government of China ... to be able to acquire ... personal information from anyone around the world,” said CSIS director David Vigneault in an interview with CBC. As per Vigneault, it's “very clear” from the app's design that data gleaned from its users “is available to the government of China.” “As an individual, I would say that I would absolutely not recommend someone have TikTok. If you are, for whatever reason, getting in the crosshairs of the [People's Republic of China], they will have a lot of information about you,” he added. ‘China developing AI using user data’ Vigneault also claimed that China is using user data to develop AI and they want to protect the interests of the Chinese Communist Party. “They're using big data analytics, they have amazing computer farms crunching the data, they are developing artificial intelligence ... based on using this data,” Vigneault said, as per the publication. “The ultimate goal is always to protect the interests of the Chinese Communist Party. And so from that point of view, in many ways, this is a threat to the way we live,” he added. What TikTok has to say Danielle Morgan, a spokesperson for TikTok in Canada, called CSIS’s claims “unsupported by evidence.” “TikTok has never shared Canadian user data with the Chinese government, nor would we if asked,” she was quoted as saying. “Singling out one platform and making unsupported accusations does not make Canadians safer. We will continue to engage with Canadian officials and would welcome the opportunity to meet with CSIS to discuss how we protect the privacy and security of Canadians,” she added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/canadas-intelligence-chief-has-a-tiktok-warning-this-is-a-threat-to/articleshow/110237463.cms

Recall uses artificial intelligence to remember and retrieve virtually everything a user has seen and done on their computer. Recall will be available exclusively on new ""Copilot+ PCs"" with powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon chips with the neural processing capabilities needed to run the AI models. The tool logs all user activity, including apps used, websites visited, documents viewed, live meeting transcripts, and more. It allows users to easily search this data and pull up a snapshot of the relevant period. How does the Recall AI feature work ""Now with Recall, you can access virtually what you have seen or done on your PC in a way that feels like having photographic memory,"" said Microsoft in a statement. The company compared it to giving your computer a ""photographic memory"" of your usage history. In a demo, a Microsoft representative showed how Recall could find a specific blue dress the user had previously viewed on Pinterest by searching with their voice. The tool could also locate an exact PowerPoint slide and pull up a quote from a Teams meeting based on the user providing contextual clues. Over 40 AI language models process the data to enable this intelligent search capability. Microsoft says all data capture and processing is done locally on the device to protect user privacy. The data will not be used to train Microsoft's AI models. Users can pause or delete the data capture and exclude sensitive apps or websites. A minimum of 256GB storage is required, with 50GB free space to use Recall.

2024-05-20,"Tower of Babel? Gen AI in Tamil, Hindi and other Indian languages",Vaitheeswaran B,"There is a lot of buzz around generative artificial intelligence or Gen AI , but it’s mostly in English. AI systems right now have relatively low accuracy and take longer to respond in Indian languages . Major AI models such as GPT 4o and Gemini have reported improvements in processing different language families, including Indian languages. But Zoho is one of the few technology companies working on developing its own large language models ( LLMs ), suitable for Indian languages and enterprise customers. Independent development of Indic language-focused LLMs in the country will have a significant advantage, says Shailesh Davey, cofounder and VP of Zoho Corp and its enterprise IT arm ManageEngine. The company is also experimenting with a Sanskrit-based machine translation model for translation within Indian languages. It is an experimental project exploring newer ways for more precise translation between Indian languages. Currently, Zoho offers Gen AI applications by integrating with large players such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Google. The company also customises existing models for specific uses such as training in the legal domain. For this, it builds small and medium language models. “Large companies building foundational models don’t share the same values. These models are predominantly trained on European language families,” says Davey. The way LLMs process Indic text is not ideal and uses a lot of hardware capacity, which makes it slower and inefficient, he says. These models could still be used in Tamil or Hindi with more computational power or ‘brute force’ as he calls it. “But then it is costly. You’ll be paying a lot more money than what’s essential and end users have to incur higher costs.” Davey says training Indiclanguage focused models from scratch and having the know-how to help them is important in the long-run. The technology is in early stages of adoption. This means we can find newer mechanisms for tokenisation of Indian languages, he adds. Tokenisation is the process of breaking down the text into smaller pieces and these are fed into AI systems. At present, scripts of non-Latin alphabets are more complex for computers to process. These capabilities need to improve and training and inference costs must come down to open up the market, he says. Zoho’s own LLM with more training on Indian languages could be ready by the end of the year. But, says Davey, it’s not comparable with large tech corporations’ assistants. Unlike consumer AI models, a lot of commercial purposes don’t need bigger AI models and vast training data sets, he says. Zoho is relying on training data in Indian languages from AI for Bharat, a research lab at IIT Madras that puts out data in regional languages. It is also getting data from organizations such as EkStep. The govt, he says, should play a bigger role in creating a digital public infrastructure such as Unified Payments Interface for AI to create data sets and tools in domestic languages. Some of the widely spoken Indian languages could have focused models and adapt faster in AI adoption due to availability of training data and commercial demand. “But for other languages, the market is there, but the cost is high, so some of the (govt) efforts could bring down the cost and then the commercial companies could build on top of that,” says Davey. Once a specific model is developed, it could be extended for other Indian languages with additional training with minimal costs, adds Dave.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tower-of-babel-gen-ai-in-tamil-hindi-and-other-indian-languages/articleshow/110258968.cms
2024-05-20,AI system to be used in Junnar against leopard attacks,aditi.shekar,"Pune: The Junnar forest division will be the department’s first territorial wing to implement an artificial intelligence--based virtual wall to mitigate human-leopard conflict. This system will be installed on a pilot basis at several hotspots of the region, based on a field visit on Tuesday to the Yedgaon dam backwaters in Junnar by representatives of Valiance Solutions, a technology solutions company. The system is primarily being used to give an early warning of animal movements through real-time monitoring, to prevent attacks and increase vigilance in certain zones. It was installed for the first time in Maharashtra in a sanctuary, at Sitarampet of Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR), to mitigate human-tiger conflict. There, it was quite well-received by locals, said officials. Deputy conservator of forests Amol Satpute added, “The sugarcane landscape makes Junnar’s forests different from the continuous forest of Tadoba. We are testing the AI system here to see if it can help reduce leopard attacks . If successful, we will take it up all over Junnar. The engineers will be looking at hotspots and deciding where to place systems. We hope it works.” The team is currently creating a database. A control room was established a month ago by the department, from where a team calls guards and officers on ground in hotspot regions and other areas of four talukas for leopard information either as witnessed or in CCTV camera footage. Forest officials are also visiting villagers in hotspots of Junnar to take details of families, GPS locations of houses, and a list of recent attacks. This activity will be done in 15-20 days, said the senior official, adding, “We will be mapping houses to create an overview of hotspots. It will help us better understand leopard attack activity and movements.” Strikes decrease after 7 leopards captured For the past three days, the forest department has received no alerts of leopard attacks or sightings in Junnar after a mission in the Yedgaon dam backwaters, where they captured seven leopards in five villages within a week. “Their DNA samples have been sent to a lab in Hyderabad. Any problematic leopard will be kept in lifetime care. Manikdoh rescue centre will also have a better capacity as it is being expanded. The proposal is with the collector and once we obtain an NOC we can start our work. The government is prioritising this activity due to the rise in leopard attacks,” said a forest official.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/ai-system-to-be-used-in-junnar-against-leopard-attacks/articleshow/110258184.cms

2024-05-17,Project Astra may be the future of AI at Google,TNN,"During the keynote session at Google I/O 2024, the company showcased a remarkable array of artificial intelligence (AI) models and tools they have been developing. Most of these new features will be available in public previews in the upcoming months. However, the most intriguing technology previewed at the event, developed by Google DeepMind and named Project Astra, will not be released for some time. Project Astra is an advanced AI assistant featuring real-time, computer vision-based interaction capabilities. Project Astra represents a significant leap beyond current chatbots, capable of performing highly sophisticated tasks. Google employs a strategy where its largest and most powerful AI models are used to train production-ready versions. Demis Hassabis, the co-founder and CEO of Google DeepMind, highlighted Project Astra as an example of this approach. He introduced the AI assistant by saying, “Today, we have some exciting new progress to share about the future of AI assistants that we are calling Project Astra. For a long time, we wanted to build a universal AI agent that can be truly helpful in everyday life.” In a video demonstration, Google’s prototype AI assistant responded to voice commands by analysing visual input from a phone camera and smart glasses.

2024-05-15,How US schools are using AI to detect guns on campus,TOI World Desk,"NEW DEHI: The United States is witnessing a significant shift in school safety measures as educational institutions across the country are increasingly adopting artificial intelligence ( AI ) solutions to detect firearms on their premises. This move is largely driven by the rising concerns over school shootings and the need for more proactive safety solutions. Kansas and Missouri have taken the lead in implementing AI gun detection systems in schools. Kansas is planning to offer grants of up to $5 million to schools for installing surveillance cameras equipped with AI systems capable of detecting individuals carrying firearms. Missouri has already passed a budget bill that includes funding for AI weapon detection systems in schools, allocating $2.5 million for the purpose. The AI technology being employed in these schools is designed to detect visible firearms in real-time. When a potential threat is identified, images are sent to a continuously staffed operations center where trained professionals verify the threat before notifying local authorities and school officials. This technology is particularly effective in detecting brandished weapons and can provide instant alerts to school administrators and law enforcement. One of the most prominent AI gun detection systems being used in schools is ZeroEyes, founded by military veterans after the fatal shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida. ZeroEyes employs AI in conjunction with surveillance cameras to detect visible firearms and sends an alert to the operations center, where a specialist will confirm if it is a gun or not. The AI software is only able to detect guns and does not have facial recognition or voice recordings. The effectiveness of these AI systems is evident in the numerous success stories. For instance, the Mount Pulaski Community Unit School District 23 in Illinois uses the ZeroEyes system and has reported several instances where the technology detected guns and led to arrests. The system's ability to analyze more than 36,000 pictures per second from its clients' surveillance feeds makes it an invaluable tool in enhancing school safety. The integration of AI technology in schools is not limited to ZeroEyes. Other companies like Iterate.ai and Omnilert are also offering AI gun detection solutions. Iterate.ai's free AI system can detect various weapons and sends automatic alerts to school administrators and local law enforcement. Omnilert Gun Detect is an AI visual system that integrates with existing camera systems to provide near-instant response at the sight of a gun. While the adoption of AI gun detection systems in schools is a significant step towards enhancing safety, there are concerns about the technology's effectiveness and potential challenges. Issues such as false alarms, missed detections, and the adaptation to the quirks of the technology have been reported. Additionally, there are privacy concerns, particularly relevant in educational settings filled with minors. Despite these challenges, the integration of AI technology in schools is expected to play an increasingly vital role in preventing potential incidents and enhancing the overall safety of students and staff. As the technology continues to evolve, it is crucial that schools and authorities work together to address the challenges and ensure the effective implementation of these systems.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-us-schools-are-using-ai-to-detect-guns-on-campus/articleshow/110154424.cms
2024-05-15,OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever announces departure,AFP,"SAN FRANCISCO : OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever announced his departure Tuesday from the startup that ignited an artificial intelligence tech race with its release of ChatGPT. Sutskever said on X, formerly Twitter, that he was leaving after almost a decade at OpenAI, whose ""trajectory has been nothing short of miraculous."" ""I'm confident that OpenAI will build AGI that is both safe and beneficial,"" he added, referring to artificial general intelligence -- digital technology that seeks to perform as well as or better than human cognition. Sutskever, OpenAI's chief scientist, sat on the board that voted to remove chief executive and fellow co-founder Sam Altman in November last year. The ousting threw the San Francisco-based startup into a tumult, with the OpenAI board hiring Altman back a few days later after staff and investors rebelled. Sutskever's position on the board was not renewed, but he remained in his position at OpenAI. ""It was an honor and a privilege to have worked together, and I will miss everyone dearly,"" Sutskever said of colleagues in the post. He added that he will focus on a personal project. OpenAI on Monday released a higher performing and even more human-like version of the artificial intelligence technology that underpins ChatGPT, making it free to all users. The new mode, GPT-4o, will be rolled out in OpenAI's products over the next few weeks, the company said, with paid customers having unlimited access to the tool. The company said the model could generate content or understand commands in voice, text, or images. ""It feels like AI from the movies,"" Altman said in a blog post. Altman has previously pointed to the Scarlett Johansson character in the movie ""Her"" as an inspiration for where he would like AI interactions to go. Google also showed off its latest AI innovations at an annual developers conference on Tuesday. OpenAI and Microsoft are in a heated rivalry with Google to be generative AI 's major player, but Facebook-owner Meta and upstart Anthropic are also making big moves to compete. The day will come when ""digital brains will become as good and even better than our own,"" Sutskever said during a talk at a TED AI summit in San Francisco late last year. ""AGI will have a dramatic impact on every area of life.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/openai-co-founder-ilya-sutskever-announces-departure/articleshow/110132081.cms
2024-05-15,When intelligence is accessible over the air,Kunal Shah,"Inefficiency is the largest employer of the world. Every time we remove inefficiencies at scale, we call it a revolution . The steam engine reduced inefficiency in transportation and started the Industrial Revolution; fertilisers reduced inefficiencies in agriculture and we called it the Green Revolution. The internet reduced the inefficiency in information transmission and we called it the Digital Revolution . The largest remaining inefficiency is availability of intelligence and judgement of the highest quality for every individual. AI solves this. The internet made information accessible over the air. AI is making intelligence accessible over the air. When intelligence is widely available, many things will happen. The Evolution Of Gatekeepers | We often rely on scores and resumes to determine creditworthiness, college admissions, or job qualifications because it’s impractical for decisionmakers to evaluate everyone individually. Instead, we use proxies like degrees, past employers, and alma maters. For example, as a philosophy graduate, I might struggle to secure interviews at companies like Google, TCS, or Cred based solely on my CV. However, AI could revolutionise this by replicating the judgement of top experts in any field, allowing for fair, individual assessments of each candidate. Imagine an AI performing in-depth interviews, emulating the decision-making of a bank’s CRO, a company’s CEO, or a college’s chief admission officer, without relying on standard processes. Scaling Analysis | For a short time I ran a teleradiology project where well-qualified radiologists from India assisted US radiologists in reading MRIs and X-rays, making them 3x more productive. It was quite successful but hard to scale because of constraints on expertise. AI can potentially do this within seconds. India produces a few hundred radiologists a year for our vast population; AI-assisted or AI radiologists can benefit both doctors and patients, and accelerate the accuracy, speed, and cost-effectiveness of healthcare. Imagine walking into an X-ray room and getting a high-quality radiologist’s report in 10 seconds for 50 rupees! With AI, this is a real possibility and the principle can be applied beyond healthcare, wherever strategic analysis is accessible only to a few experts currently. AI Skills For Everyone | One of the jobs I did early in my career was teaching students how to use the internet at firms like Wintech and NIIT. Back then, it was a hot-selling course as internet proficiency was required for a good job. Some Bay Area companies are already testing for AI/GPT skills in prospective employees. They give assignments to candidates that need to be completed in 24 hours and would be humanly impossible to do unless GPT was used to assist them. GPT skills training will be a new opportu nity that will grow along with the popularity of AI. Expressive AI | It’s hard to express visual ideas – whether it’s for app designs, interiors/ architecture, or new products – when reliant on just words. But a picture is worth a thousand words, and AI can mock up or draw designs the way we are thinking of them. I already express ideas in the form of AI-mocked user flows or UI design with GPT, making me 10x more efficient in sharing ideas with the team. This could unleash a new dimension of speed and effectiveness in imagining and developing new ideas. In essence, gaps between talent and opportunity, experts and clients, seekers and sources will evaporate. When AI is available to augment everyone’s thinking, asymmetric outcomes will go to those who execute well – doers and creators who bend reality to make the world a better place. ChatGPT is a constant companion for me. I’m excited about the revolutions that 1.5 billion people assisted by AI can spark. Kunal Shah is a financial services entrepreneur.

2024-05-14,"Japan sees need for sharp hike in power output by 2050 to meet demand from AI, chip plants",Reuters,"TOKYO: Japan envisages the need for electricity output to rise 35% to 50% by 2050 due to growing demand from semiconductor plants and data centres backing artificial intelligence ( AI ), the government has forecast. Power output should grow from 1 trillion kilowatt-hours (kWh) projected for the current decade to about 1.35-1.5 trillion kWh in 2050 to meet demand as Japan sets up more data centres, chip factories and other energy-consuming businesses, the government said in a document published late on Monday. The increase in demand would be the first in 20 years and requires large-scale investments in power sources, the document said. Unless Japan increases renewable energy output, stable supply of power could be uncertain, the government said, as it began mapping out a new strategy on decarbonisation and industrial policy by 2040 which it plans to finalise by the end of March. Japan, which relies heavily on the Middle East for fossil fuel supplies, last year passed a law aimed at promoting decarbonisation investments totalling more than 150 trillion yen ($962 billion) in the public and private sectors over 10 years. The country is counting on next-generation solar cells , known as perovskite solar cells, floating offshore wind farms, restarts of nuclear power plants and the introduction of next-generation reactors to meet the demand, the paper showed.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/japan-sees-need-for-sharp-hike-in-power-output-by-2050-to-meet-demand-from-ai-chip-plants/articleshow/110100943.cms

2024-05-14,Is AI to blame for humanity's failure to contact aliens?,TOI World Desk,"NEW DELHI: A groundbreaking theory suggests that the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its eventual evolution into Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) may be a significant barrier preventing civilizations from becoming space-faring entities . This concept, elaborated by Michael Garrett, the Sir Bernard Lovell chair of Astrophysics and director of the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Manchester, posits that ASI represents a ""great filter"" — a developmental threshold that is extraordinarily difficult to cross, potentially explaining why we have yet to discover extraterrestrial civilizations. As per a report in Space.com, the theory, which is a focal point of a recent study published in Acta Astronautica, suggests that the emergence of ASI could intersect crucially with a civilization's attempt to transition from being a single-planet species to a multiplanetary one. According to Garrett, ""The challenge with AI, and specifically ASI, lies in its autonomous, self-amplifying and improving nature. It possesses the potential to enhance its own capabilities at a speed that outpaces our own evolutionary timelines without AI."" This rapid advancement could lead to scenarios where AI systems, growing beyond human control, could undertake actions leading to catastrophic outcomes. Garrett highlights a chilling possibility: ""If nations increasingly rely on and cede power to autonomous AI systems that compete against each other, military capabilities could be used to kill and destroy on an unprecedented scale."" The integration of autonomous AI in military defense systems is particularly concerning, raising the prospect of AI systems making decisions beyond ethical and legal boundaries. The dire implications of this are not limited to the battlefield; they could threaten the very survival of the civilizations that created them. This research serves as a stark wake-up call for the global community to establish robust regulatory frameworks to guide the development of AI, especially in military applications. The goal is to ensure that AI evolution aligns with the long-term survival of our species and that the path to becoming a multiplanetary society is pursued more vigorously, the Space.com report said. As the world stands at this critical juncture, the actions we take now could determine whether we become a thriving interstellar civilization or fall victim to the creations of our own intelligence. This new perspective on AI and its implications for SETI adds a profound dimension to the ongoing discourse on our technological future and our place among the stars.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/is-ai-to-blame-for-humanitys-failure-to-contact-aliens/articleshow/110122319.cms

""The core of writing music, you're trying to evoke an emotion out of your audience, whether it's joy, heartbreak, whatever the case may be,"" Bas said. ""When I try to give it those prompts, it's a little tough to get that across."" Bas talked about a song he made with AI. When he heard the AI-made beat, he imagined meeting a girl at a club and trying to talk to her. But as he wrote the lyrics and melody, he realised AI didn't really understand that experience. ""I'm like, 'man, AI never been to the club,'"" he said. Many artists are worried about how AI will affect their jobs and the quality of their art. ""There are a lot of people in our industry, a lot of creators , where AI is almost a dirty word right now,"" Bas explained.

2024-05-10,“Exactly why we need..”: Ola's Bhavish Aggarwal after LinkedIn removes this post,TOI Tech Desk,"Ola 's founder Bhavish Aggarwal has criticised Microsoft-owned professional networking platform LinkedIn after it removed his post on “pronoun illness”. Aggarwal recently termed the use of ‘pronouns’ as illness saying that India doesn’t need ‘new pronouns’. In a post on X, Aggarwal said that LinkedIn's Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool was imposing a political ideology on Indian users which is unsafe and sinister. ""Dear @LinkedIn this post of mine was about YOUR AI imposing a political ideology on Indian users that’s unsafe, sinister,"" the CEO of the ride-hailing app said in the post. “Rich of you to call my post unsafe! This is exactly why we need to build our own tech and AI in India. Else we’ll just be pawns in others political objectives,” he added. What Bhavish Aggarwal said in his “pronoun illness” post Earlier this week, Aggarwal took to X to share his thoughts on the concept of gender pronouns and jopes that this wouldn't become widespread in India. “Most of us in India have no clue about politics of this pronouns illness. People do it because it’s become expected in our corporate culture, especially MNCs. Better to send this illness back where it came from. Our culture has always had respect for all. No need for new pronouns,” posted Aggarwal on X. “Hoping that this “pronoun illness” doesn’t reach India. Many “big city schools” in India are now teaching it to kids. Also see many CVs with pronouns these days. Need to know where to draw the line in following the west blindly!,” he wrote in another post. He had asked the AI bot on LinkedIn about him and had shared a screenshot of the bot's response.

2024-05-10,Tech influencer: 4 Big reasons why 'study Computer Science and work in tech to become rich' is no longer valid,TOI Tech Desk,"The once-unstoppable tech engineering sector is facing headwinds. Major tech companies like Microsoft and Google have implemented significant layoffs , prompting tech influencer Deedy Das to warn of an impending ""winter"" on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). Das highlights the stark contrast between today's job market and the booming tech scene of two decades ago. Aspiring engineers who once saw Computer Science as a guaranteed path to employment may face a different reality. Companies, even after layoffs, are hesitant to hire new graduates. Startups, in particular, seem to favor experienced professionals. ""In the last 20yrs, ""study CS and work in tech"" became a ""path"" to wealth Now: —BigTech did layoffs, aren't hiring —Tech job postings are ~40% of '21 —Startups often prefer tenured hires —Huge pipeline of CS majors: 40% of MIT Winter is coming for software engineering,"" wrote in the first post. The likely reasons behind tough times for techies Deedy argues that the very nature of technology's role in society has shifted. Compared to the year 2000, where technology played a smaller role, our daily lives are now heavily dependent on it. However, this dependence hasn't translated to more jobs. Companies prioritize efficiency over growth, leading to a potential saturation in the workforce. Further complicating the situation is the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI algorithms are increasingly automating tasks that were once performed by humans, potentially shrinking the demand for traditional software engineers. While acknowledging the cyclical nature of tech trends, Deedy expresses doubt about a quick recovery. High costs associated with training new graduates make startups reluctant to invest in them. This creates a crucial mismatch between the skills students acquire and what the industry demands, leaving many CS graduates unemployed. Deedy's warnings paint a picture of a tech industry in flux. While not a complete collapse, a period of stagnation seems likely before the sector experiences another boom cycle. As technology evolves and market dynamics shift, the future of tech engineering remains uncertain.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/tech-influencer-4-big-reasons-why-study-computer-science-and-work-in-tech-to-become-rich-is-no-longer-valid/articleshow/109894942.cms
2024-05-08,AI startup Atlan bags $105 million from investors at a valuation of $750 mn,Asmita Dey,"MUMBAI: Artificial intelligence (AI) is perhaps the only new age tech space which has continued to evince investor interest even amid a global slowdown in tech funding. AI startup Atlan led by Indian founders Prukalpa Sankar and Varun Banka has bagged a fresh $105 million in funding led by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC along with co-investor Meritech Capital at a valuation of $750 million. Existing investors Peak XV Partners and Salesforce Ventures also participated in the round taking the five-year old company’s total fund count to over $200 million. Sankar and Banka started up with their data intelligence venture SocialCops in New Delhi whose tech tools powered projects including India’s national data platform DISHA. In fact, Atlan was incubated while working on the project. Now based in the US, Atlan is building a platform for AI and data governance and counts corporate biggies like Unilever, Cisco, News Corp and Ralph Lauren among its clients. The fresh funding comes amid rising demand for AI-data readiness and governance framework among companies. “Over the past year, boards have consistently asked their CIOs and CDOs about their AI roadmaps, who have realised that the main hurdle isn’t AI models but the lack of AI-ready data—data enriched with business context, trust and security. Atlan is addressing this by building the control plane for the data and AI stack integrating trust and context into the digital fabric,” co-founder Sankar said in a statement on Tuesday. Atlan claimed that its revenues have grown multi-fold in the past two years. Data practitioners spend 30%-50% of their time finding and understanding data; the startup claims that its platform cuts that time by 95%. The company centralises data management. “…we built a solution that unifies data across warehouses, lakehouses, BI tools, and AI agents. In doing so, Atlan empowers data teams to leverage the entirety of their data at high velocity and scale by ensuring its quality, accuracy, and governance. This means data teams can efficiently and effectively collaborate on data that would be otherwise siloed for various use cases, including populating AI models with trustworthy data,” added Banka.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ai-startup-atlan-bags-105-million-from-investors-at-a-valuation-of-750-mn/articleshow/109955881.cms
2024-05-05,"Financial Intelligence Unit arms itself with AI, ML tools to check money laundering",PTI,"NEW DELHI: Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has operationalised an advanced 2.0 version of its information technology system, armed with artificial intelligence and machine learning tools, to check money laundering and terrorist financing crimes in the country's economic channels. The upgrade of the technological backbone was required as the volume of data (suspicious transaction reports) flagged by banks and various other financial institutions to the FIU for analysis and further dissemination to investigative and intelligence organisations has been ""increasing"", a latest report for the 2022-23 fiscal said. The agency was set up in 2004 to ""play a decisive role in India's fight against the menace of money laundering and terrorism financing"" under the legal setup of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The recently released report has been accessed by PTI which says that the Financial Intelligence Network (FINnet) 2.0 was envisaged as the country's regulatory environment has been changing, technology landscape has been evolving and hence an overhaul of the existing FINnet 1.0 system was required to achieve an efficient system of collection, processing and dissemination of financial intelligence. ""FINnet 2.0 leverages emerging technologies for superior analytical competencies, data quality improvement, incisive compliance monitoring and cutting-edge security tools for strengthening anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism capabilities of FIU-India and its reporting universe,"" the report said. It enables generation of risk scores for individuals, businesses, reports, networks and cases to be able to flag high risk cases, entities or reports for immediate action and it prioritises cases by using risk analytics, it said. The 2.0 version has capabilities of ""advanced analytics"" by employing artificial intelligence and machine learning tools and a strategic analysis lab to stay abreast with the developments in anti-money laundering and emerging technologies, the report said. The new system also uses natural language processing (NLP) and text mining tools to analyse textual inputs like 'grounds of suspicion'. The FINnet 2.0 is aimed to provide sophistication in FIU's ""analytical and data processing capacity"" and it comprises of three sub-systems. While FINGate is meant for information collection from banks, financial institutions and intermediaries, FINCore is for analytics by FIU experts and FINex is used for disseminating financial intelligence reports to probe agencies like the Income-tax department, ED, CBI, DRI and snooping organisations like the IB, military intelligence and the NTRO among others. FINCore, the most important vertical of this technology setup, uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to generate summaries and sharing suspicious transaction reports with various law enforcement agencies based on risk profile, it said. This third sub-system uses information from external databases like the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), Ministry of Corporate Affairs, National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction and Security Interest (CERSAI), Central Depository Services Ltd. (CDSL) and National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) to draw a ""holistic picture of the entity in question and helps in more effective resolution and identification of the entity"". The report stated that as the FIU deals with ""sensitive"" financial data, confidentiality and data security were important component of the upgraded IT system. ""Various measures are put in place to ensure security of data, including strong, end-to-end encryption, automatic blocking of logins after a set number of unsuccessful login attempts, controlled access to content stored on the portal, logging of security incidents, identity management solution capable of managing security rights and privileges by individuals,"" it said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/financial-intelligence-unit-arms-itself-with-ai-ml-tools-to-check-money-laundering/articleshow/109858736.cms

2024-05-05,‘Just like nuclear weapons’: Warren Buffett has this big warning on the use of artificial intelligence,TOI Business Desk,"Warren Buffett recently shared his thoughts on the potential impact of Artificial Intelligence during Berkshire Hathaway 's Annual Shareholder meeting. He expressed concern about the technology's ability to deceive, citing a personal experience where he witnessed a video of himself delivering a message that he never actually recorded. The video was so convincing that even his closest family members would have been unable to distinguish it from reality. ""I had an experience that does make me a little nervous. Very recently, I saw an image in front of my eyes, on the screen. It was me and my voice, wearing the kind of clothes I wear, and my wife or daughter wouldn't have been able to detect any difference. And I was delivering a message that no way came from me"", he said. Buffett acknowledged that AI has the potential for both immense good and harm, and only time will reveal the extent to which it will transform society. “I don't know anything about AI, but I don't deny its existence or importance or anything of the sort. Last year I said that we let a genie out of a bottle when we developed nuclear weapons. And that genie has been doing some terrible things lately, and the power of that genie is what, you know, scares the hell out of me. And under that, I don't know any way to get the genie back in the bottle, and AI is somewhat similar. It's out, it's part way out of the bottle, and, and it's enormously important, and it's going to be done by somebody. So, we may wish we'd never seen that genie, or it may do wonderful things, and I'm certainly not the person that can evaluate that.” Asked about which business of Berkshire is AI likely to impact, he said, “In terms of our businesses, they'll figure things out. We've got smart people and obviously if it's used in a prosocial way, it's got terrific benefits to society. But I don't know how you make sure that that's what happens anymore than I know how to be sure that when you use two atomic bombs in World War II that you know that you hadn't created something you could destroy the world later on.” Meanwhile, Warren Buffett assured shareholders that the executives expected to succeed him at Berkshire Hathaway were ready for the job and heaped praise on Apple even though Berkshire recently trimmed its position in the iPhone maker. Speaking at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting, the legendary investor also paid tribute to his late partner Charlie Munger and said he expected the conglomerate’s cash pile, which reached a record $189 billion last quarter, to continue growing.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/just-like-nuclear-weapons-warren-buffett-has-this-big-warning-on-the-use-of-artificial-intelligence/articleshow/109861618.cms
2024-05-03,Indian researchers develop AI tool for accurate reading of pregnancy scans,Ipsita Pati,"GURGAON: Doctors at six hospitals in India may soon start using an artificial intelligence tool , called Garbhini-GA2 , to improve diagnosis of foetal abnormalities and get accurate gestational age for women who come for check-ups at later stages of their pregnancies. Researchers from IIT Madras and Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), who have developed the tool, say it will help reduce infant and maternal mortality rates, especially for women who often don’t find out about pregnancies till the second trimester. THSTI-Faridabad is an institute under the central govt’s department of biotechnology. According to the National Family Health Survey, around 30-40% of women who are pregnant come for their first scans in the second trimester, which means they don’t know their exact due date and doctors have to rely on dates of the last menstrual period to come up with an estimate. Garbhini-GA2, which is installed into ultrasound machines, is meant to do away with this in accurately diagnosing gestational age even in scans carried out in the second trimester, its developers said. “If you want to know the stage of pregnancy and due date, the most accurate estimate will come from the first trimester scan,” said Himanshu Sinha, associate professor at department of biotechnology in IIT-Madras. “The tool’s primary function is to provide accurate pregnancy dating, which is crucial for managing pregnancy care. Accurate dating allows obstetricians to schedule necessary scans and tests at the right time, ensuring that potential complications are detected and managed effectively. It also helps in determining the optimal delivery window, thus reducing the risks associated with preterm and post-term births,” said Dr Shinjini Bhatnagar, principal investigator of the GARBH-Ini programme and professor at THSTI-Faridabad. For now, researchers are in talks with six hospitals in NCR, Assam, Gujarat, Telangana and Puducherry. Researchers want to study the impact of the tool at six hospitals, and then roll it out across the country in collaboration with ultrasound manufacturers and hospitals. “The team is currently focusing on smaller hospitals, aiming to minimise problems of adverse birth outcomes where gestational dating is a significant issue. The ultimate aim is to integrate it into ultrasound machines for effective clinical deployment”, said Dr Ramachandran Thiruvengadam, assistant professor at Pondicherry Institute of Medical Sciences, one of the collaborating institutions in the project. The Garbh-Ini initiative, introduced by the central govt in May 2015 at the Civil Hospital in Gurgaon, initially involved a study of women who were followed from early pregnancy to delivery and post-partum. This cohort formed the foundation for Garbhini-GA2, which was developed by feeding troves of data to a machine learning tool that can read ultrasound scans.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/indian-researchers-develop-ai-tool-for-accurate-reading-of-pregnancy-scans/articleshow/109796793.cms

Scammers may use deceptive tactics and voice cloning to imitate voices of family members and friends, to extract money from potential victims , said an advisory issued on Saturday. Scammers employ various tactics to convince victims that they were indeed in emotional distress and urgently needed money. ""Behind the scene, the scammer utilises sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) software to clone the voice of the person they are impersonating. They obtain the voice sample of the person they are impersonating from their social media posts/videos or by simply talking to the person over the phone as a wrong call,"" the press release explained. The scammer then requests the victim to transfer money immediately, often suggesting fast payment methods such as UPI , police said. To protect oneself, cybercrime police suggest asking questions or contacting the supposed caller through a verified number before taking any action. ""Stay informed about common scams, including voice cloning fraud , and recognise the warning signs. Be wary of unexpected requests for money, especially if they involve urgent situations or emotional manipulation.

2024-04-26,"Alphabet, Microsoft shares jump on proof of near-term AI returns",Reuters,"Google and Microsoft rallied on Friday as the technology bellwethers showed that hefty investments into artificial intelligence could reap more immediate revenue returns, a sharp contrast to Meta Platforms' view that AI is a long-term bet. Microsoft's shares advanced 3.84% in trading before the U.S. market opened after the company beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue and profit, driven by gains from the adoption of AI across its cloud services . Google-parent Alphabet soared an even-steeper 11.5%, poised to top $2 trillion in market value, after not only beating quarterly estimates, but also rewarding investors with its first-ever dividend and a $70 billion stock buyback plan. That sparked a 1% to 3% rise in the shares of other big tech companies , including Amazon.com, Apple, Nvidia and even Meta Platforms, whose stock price tumbled over 10% on Thursday as the social media firm signalled its costly AI bets could take years to pay off. The tech titans have been locked in a fierce battle in the race for generative AI, which can create text, videos and photos from prompts and is seen as the next frontier in tech. Analysts though are divided over whether Alphabet or Microsoft wears the AI crown. ""Microsoft continues to put together masterpiece after masterpiece as this quarter represents its dominant position in the AI Revolution,"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said. But Scott Devitt, Ives' colleague at Wedbush said, ""We think the results further validate Google's position as a leading AI beneficiary."" Microsoft has access to OpenAI's coveted AI technologies, which it has been working to infuse across its product portfolio, such as in Bing, Microsoft 365 and, most importantly, the Azure cloud-computing platform. ""AI services contributed seven points of growth"" to the 31% jump in revenue from Azure, Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood said. While Goldman Sachs said Microsoft is well positioned to replicate the success of its Azure build-out playbook in its AI-laced suite, Oppenheimer predicted the company's AI dominance would be reminiscent of a couple of decades back. ""We see it revisiting its PC-era-type dominance, but of a 1000x larger market as it is the dominant AI platform for enterprises,"" analyst Timothy Horan said. On the other hand, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai touted Google's AI offerings as a boon to its market-leading service -- core search results. ""Google's Q1 ranked somewhere north of outstanding ... and management appears in better control of its own AI narrative,"" said RBC analyst Khadijah Gibson. ""Aside from a similarly-sized capex guide up as Meta, Google is more than weathering the GenAI concerns."" If premarket gains hold, Alphabet, Wall Street's fourth-most valuable company, will cross $2 trillion in market value on an intraday basis -- a milestone it last hit, but failed to hold on to, three years ago, according to LSEG Datastream. Three of the so-called 'Big Six' have reported quarterly results so far. Of the remaining, Amazon, now the only one that does not pay a dividend, is due to report results next week.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/alphabet-microsoft-shares-jump-on-proof-of-near-term-ai-returns/articleshow/109621980.cms
2024-04-26,"Google parent Alphabet announces its first-ever dividend, shares soar to nearly 16%",TOI Business Desk,"NEW DELHI: Google 's parent company Alphabet on Thursday announced its first-ever dividend and a $70 billion stock buyback , leading to the stock surge of nearly 16% after the bell. The dividend will be 20 cents per share. Alphabet is returning capital while spending billions of dollars on data centres to compete with rivals on generative artificial intelligence (AI). Alphabet's Big Tech rival, Meta Platforms , three months ago, announced its own first-ever dividend, a move that spiralled the social media company's stock market value by $196 billion the following day. Amazon.com remains the lone holdout among Big Tech firms not offering a dividend. Alphabet beat expectations for the quarter in sales, profit and advertising - metrics that are all closely watched. ""Alphabet's announced dividend payouts and buybacks on top of the solid earnings beat are not only a breath of fresh air for the tech market as a whole, but also a very intelligent strategy for the search engine giant going into a tough time of the year,"" said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. Alphabet's after-hours share surge of nearly 16% following the report increased its stock market value by about $300 billion to over $2 trillion. In a call to discuss results, CEO Sundar Pichai touted Google's AI offerings as a boon to its core search results. ""We are encouraged that we are seeing an increase in search usage among people who are using the AI overviews,"" he said. Revenue was $80.54 billion for the quarter ended March 31, compared with estimates of $78.59 billion, according to LSEG data. The search firm exceeded expectations for first-quarter revenue due to increased demand for its cloud services driven by the growing use of artificial intelligence and consistent advertising expenditure. Google stated that advertising increased by 13% in the quarter to $61.7 billion. This amount is compared to the average estimate of $60.2 billion, as per LSEG data. Alphabet had a disappointing fourth quarter where advertising sales fell short, leading to a drop in share prices, due to increased competition from companies such as Facebook and emerging platforms like TikTok. TikTok is uncertain about its future following US President Joe Biden 's approval of a bill that could result in a ban on the app if it is not sold within the next nine to 12 months. Meanwhile, revenue from Google Cloud increased by 28% in the initial quarter, driven by a surge in generative artificial intelligence tools that depend on cloud services to provide the technology to clients. Google's cloud services are appealing to startups backed by venture capital that are working on generative AI technologies because of the pricing and seamless integration with other tools, as mentioned by investors and experts in the past.

2024-04-25,Why Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has increased Meta’s AI budget by billions of dollars,TOI Tech Desk,"Meta , the company that owns Facebook , Instagram , and WhatsApp , surprised investors by announcing it will spend billions more on artificial intelligence (AI) than initially planned. The tech giant now expects to spend between $35 billion and $40 billion this year on building AI systems and infrastructure, a substantial increase from its earlier estimate of $30 billion to $37 billion. The main reason for the massive spending hike? Mark Zuckerberg , Meta's CEO, is determined to make his company a leader in the hot field of AI. After the success of ChatGPT , an AI chatbot that can engage in human-like conversations, Zuckerberg shifted Meta's focus to incorporating AI across its apps and services. From smarter search on Facebook and Instagram to AI-powered image creation tools and intelligent virtual assistants, Zuckerberg wants to put AI everywhere at Meta. He believes this will help Meta create innovative new products and remain competitive in the years ahead. Investors, however, were spooked by Meta's AI spending plans. Meta's stock plunged over 16% on Wednesday after the earnings announcement. Not only is the company raising its spending forecast, but it also warned that revenue growth may slow in the coming months. Meta did report substantial revenue of $36.5 billion for the first three months of 2024, up 27% from a year earlier. However, it was predicted that the current quarter revenue could come below analysts' estimates at $36.5 billion to $39 billion. Zuckerberg's grand AI vision Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg warned shareholders that it will likely take ""several years"" to turn its generative AI technologies into major revenue sources. However, he expressed optimism that the large upfront costs will pay dividends by creating new AI-powered products and features that drive user engagement and advertising opportunities. ""Building the leading AI will also be a larger undertaking than the other experiences we've added to our apps, and this is likely going to take several years,"" Zuckerberg said on an investor call. ""But the initial signs are quite positive here, too."" Meta has moved aggressively to integrate generative AI across its apps and services. Last week, it launched a ChatGPT rival called the Meta AI assistant. It added AI-powered tools for summarising text, analysing code, creating imagery, and tutoring maths across Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and other platforms. Zuckerberg said ""tens of millions"" of people have already tried the Meta AI assistant since its launch. But he acknowledged it would take time to build advanced AI systems that are useful enough to become major moneymakers. ""There are several massive ways to build a business here,"" Zuckerberg said of generative AI's commercial potential. ""We should have confidence that if these AI products become widely used, they will become huge businesses over time."" Zuckerberg’s meta dreams keep bleeding more money Aside from AI, Meta is also pouring money into developing virtual reality hardware and software through its Reality Labs division. The goal is to build the ""metaverse"" - Zuckerberg's vision of interconnected digital worlds. Reality Labs lost $3.8 billion in the first quarter despite $440 million in sales as Meta invested in headset development and Horizon, its metaverse operating system. Despite this, Zuckerberg remains committed to these efforts, saying Meta's smart glasses developed with Ray-Ban are selling out in some markets. “I used to think that AR glasses wouldn’t really be a mainstream product until we had full holographic displays,” he said. “But now it seems pretty clear that there’s also a meaningful market for fashionable AI glasses without a display.” Just earlier this week, the Ray-Ban Smart Glasses got the multimodal AI capabilities, which enables the glasses to see what you are seeing. Then, there are new styles and colours coming in the US and other markets, in time for summers. Historically dependent on digital advertising, Meta is now staking its future on cutting-edge technologies that could open up entirely new revenue sources. Whether Zuckerberg's multi-billion dollar AI gambit pays off remains to be seen. But the Facebook founder has made it clear - he's willing to spend whatever it takes to transform Meta into an AI powerhouse",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-facebook-founder-mark-zuckerberg-has-increased-metas-ai-budget-by-billions-of-dollars/articleshow/109588444.cms

2024-04-22,"US Air Force tests AI-piloted jet in dogfight against human pilot, watch video",TOI World Desk,"NEW DELHI: The US Air Force has unveiled its latest milestone by placing artificial intelligence (AI) in the pilot’s seat. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) on Thursday revealed that an AI-controlled jet engaged in a dogfight with a human pilot during a test conducted last year, according to The Verge. DARPA also shared a 7-minute video on the social media platform, YouTube, highlighting in-air combat tests between AI and human-piloted F-16s. DARPA's venture into AI integration, initiated in December 2022 as part of its Air Combat Evolution (ACE) program, has yielded remarkable results. Through meticulous experimentation, DARPA engineered an AI system capable of autonomously piloting a fighter jet while adhering to stringent Air Force safety protocols. Transitioning from simulations to real-world applications, DARPA installed its AI system in the experimental X-62A aircraft . This momentous step culminated in a successful in-air dogfight test against a human-controlled F-16 at Edwards Air Force Base in California, in September 2023. Crucially, human pilots onboard the X-62A retained control authority, with the capability to disable the AI system if necessary. Yet, as DARPA reports, such intervention proved unnecessary throughout the encounter. The engagement showcased both aircraft executing ""high-aspect nose-to-nose engagements,"" closing in at speeds reaching 1,200 miles per hour within 2,000 feet. Bill Gray, chief test pilot at the Air Force’s Test Pilot School, underscored the significance of this milestone, saying, ""Dogfighting was the problem to solve so we could start testing autonomous artificial intelligence systems in the air,"" The Verge reported. He said that the insights gained from these endeavors extend far beyond dogfight scenarios, informing the potential of autonomous systems across various tasks. As of now, DARPA has conducted 21 test flights, with plans for continued testing throughout 2024. While the rapid progress in AI technology heralds promising advancements in military capabilities, it also raises pertinent questions regarding the ethical and strategic employment of such systems. Reports indicate the Pentagon's keen interest in harnessing AI for defense purposes and bolstering its drone fleet.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-us-air-force-tests-ai-piloted-jet-in-dogfight-against-human-pilot/articleshow/109501717.cms

2024-04-21,artificial intelligence has a measurement problem,NYT News Service,"SAN FRANCISCO: There's a problem with leading artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude: We don't really know how smart they are. That's because, unlike companies that make cars or drugs or baby formula, AI companies aren't required to submit their products for testing before releasing them to the public. Users are left to rely on the claims of AI companies, which often use vague, fuzzy phrases like ""improved capabilities"" to describe how their models differ from one version to the next. Models are updated so frequently that a chatbot that struggles with a task one day might mysteriously excel at it the next. Shoddy measurement also creates a safety risk. Without better tests for AI models , it's hard to know which capabilities are improving faster than expected, or which products might pose real threats of harm. In this year's AI Index - a big annual report put out by Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence - the authors describe poor measurement as one of the biggest challenges facing AI researchers. ""The lack of standardized evaluation makes it extremely challenging to systematically compare the limitations and risks of various AI models,"" said editor-in-chief, Nestor Maslej. For years, the most popular method for measuring AI was the Turing Test - an exercise proposed in 1950 by mathematician Alan Turing, which tests whether a computer program can fool a person into mistaking its responses for a human's. But today's AI systems can pass the Turing Test with flying colors, and researchers have had to come up with harder evaluations. One of the most common tests given to AI models today - the SAT for chatbots, essentially - is a test known as Massive Multitask Language Understanding, or MMLU. The MMLU, which was released in 2020, consists of a collection of roughly 16,000 multiple-choice questions covering dozens of academic subjects, ranging from abstract algebra to law and medicine. It's supposed to be a kind of general intelligence test - the more a chatbot answers correctly, the smarter it is. It has become the gold standard for AI companies competing for dominance. (When Google released its most advanced AI model, Gemini Ultra , earlier this year, it boasted that it had scored 90% on the MMLU - the highest score ever recorded.) Dan Hendrycks, an AI safety researcher who helped develop the MMLU while in graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley, said that while he thought MMLU ""probably has another year or two of shelf life,"" it will soon need to be replaced by different, harder tests. AI systems are getting too smart for the tests we have now, and it's getting more difficult to design new ones. There are dozens of other tests out there - with names including TruthfulQA and HellaSwag - that are meant to capture other facets of AI performance. But these tests are capable of measuring only a narrow slice of an AI system's power. And none of them are designed to answer the more subjective questions many users have, such as: Is this chatbot fun to talk to? Is it better for automating routine office work, or creative brainstorming? How strict are its safety guardrails? There is a problem known as ""data contamination,"" when the questions and answers for benchmark tests are included in an AI model's training data, essentially allowing it to cheat. And there is no independent testing or auditing process for these models, meaning that AI companies are essentially grading their own homework. In short, AI measurement is a mess - a tangle of sloppy tests, apples-to-oranges comparisons and self-serving hype that has left users, regulators and AI developers themselves grasping in the dark. ""Despite the appearance of science, most developers really judge models based on vibes or instinct,"" said Nathan Benaich, an AI investor with Air Street Capital. ""That might be fine for the moment, but as these models grow in power and social relevance, it won't suffice."" The solution here is likely a combination of public and private efforts. Governments can, and should, come up with robust testing programs that measure both the raw capabilities and the safety risks of AI models, and they should fund grants and research projects aimed at coming up with new, high-quality evaluations. In its executive order on AI last year, the White House directed several federal agencies, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology, to create and oversee new ways of evaluating AI systems.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/artificial-intelligence-has-a-measurement-problem/articleshow/109468730.cms
2024-04-21,OpenAI filing slams Elon Musk's 'revisionist history',Bloomberg,"OpenAI says Elon Musk 's claim that the company has abandoned its altruistic principles in pursuit of profits is nothing more than "" revisionist history "" and an effort to boost his competing artificial intelligence company. Musk, one of OpenAI's early funders, sued the firm and CEO Sam Altman in March, saying it had breached its founding promise to build responsible artificial intelligence when it entered into a partnership with Microsoft Corp. ""Years ago, plaintiff Elon Musk abandoned OpenAI when his bid to dominate the venture failed,"" OpenAI's lawyers said in a court filing asking for the suit to be dismissed. ""Now that he has launched a competing artificial intelligence firm, Musk seeks to leverage the success OpenAI has achieved and to direct OpenAI's affairs for his own commercial benefit."" OpenAI's lawyers also refute Musk 's claim that the company promised not to monetize its technology, saying the billionaire CEO of Tesla and owner of X, had failed to show evidence of any contract to the contrary. ""Musk cannot bring suit on an agreement that he cannot even plead into existence,"" according to the filing in state court in San Francisco. In his complaint, Musk quoted OpenAI's certificate of incorporation, in which the non-profit pledged to make its product available to the public. But the pledge was not open-ended, OpenAI's lawyers said in their filing. ""In its certificate of incorporation, OpenAI expressed its intention to 'seek to open source technology for the public benefit when applicable,' thus recognizing from the outset that its mission required 'an ongoing conversation about what work should be open-sourced and what shouldn't."" Musk also faulted OpenAI for entering into a multibillion-dollar partnership with Microsoft, its principal funder. ""But Musk identifies no provision of the alleged 'Founding Agreement' that bars licensing of OpenAI's technology or precludes a third party from occupying a board observer seat,"" OpenAI's lawyers wrote. Musk couldn't immediately be reached for comment. A hearing on the request for dismissal of the suit is set for April 24.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/openai-filing-slams-elon-musks-revisionist-history/articleshow/109468813.cms
2024-04-20,AI a 'fundamental change in the news ecosystem': Expert,AFP,"PERUGIA: Artificial intelligence is shaking up journalism and in the short term will cause ""a fundamental change in the news ecosystem "", media expert David Caswell told AFP. A former employee at Yahoo! and BBC News Labs, the British broadcaster's innovation wing, Caswell spoke as industry leaders gathered in the Italian city of Perugia to discuss the biggest questions facing their trade. ""We don't know. But what we are trying to do is to understand all of the possibilities or as many of the possibilities as we can. But I think there are some things that are becoming clearer: one is the fact that more media will probably be created and originated and sourced by machines. So machines will do more gathering in a lot of journalism, will do more of the producing, the audio, the video and the text, and will create the kind of experiences of consumption that consumers have. That is a very fundamental change in the information ecosystem in general, and the news ecosystem in particular. This is structurally different than the one that we're in now. We don't know how long it's going to take - it may be two, four, seven years. I think it's going to be faster because there is very little friction. People don't need news devices, new hardware, they don't need a lot of money as producers, they don't need technical expertise. All those things that were barriers in the previous generation of AI are no longer barriers, thanks to generative AI"". ""One class of development is in new tools that enables AI workflow, for example JP Politikens in Denmark focused on making their existing products and activities more efficient. But it is also a basis for transitioning their products, their workforce, the activities into this new AI world. There is a tool that Google has built -- the code name is 'Genesis' -- that they are testing with publishers. Some publishers are building their own. There will be platform versions of these tools. These are tools, you bring your news gathering on the left side: your PDF, transcripts, audios, videos.. roughly. It helps you do things like analysis, summaries, turn into scripts, audios. They're orchestrated by the tool. What the journalist is doing is coordinating the tool, verifying the content all the way through to the end, and editing. The job becomes using the tool, like an editorial manager of this AI tool . It technically works. But that's a different thing than putting it in a newsroom in a large operation and use it day in day out, months in, months out. That's a big question: is it going to be enthusiastically adopted, to be used in a way that isn't very productive in the long run or will that enhance the productivity of newsroom dramatically?"" ""In the last decade it was very expensive. It was very difficult: You need the data, you had to build a data warehouse, have an enterprise deal with Amazon or Google cloud, you had to hire data scientists, to have a team of data engineers. it was a major investment. Only the BBC, the New York Times, this level of organisations could really afford it. That's not true with generative AI. You can run news workflow through interfaces that you pay 20 dollars a month. You don't need to be a coder. All you need is motivation, enthusiasm and curiosity. There's lots of people in news organisations that would not have been involved in AI in the past because they did not have the technical background and now they can just use it. It's a much more open form of AI: both smaller newsrooms can do a lot with, and more junior individuals in more established newsrooms can do a lot with. I think it's a good thing, but it's also a disruptive thing. Often the internal politics in newsrooms are disrupted by that"". ""AI has been around since the 1950s. But AI for practical purposes appeared with ChatGPT. It's going to be quite a while -- years -- before we really understand how to use them for valuable things. There are so many things that you can do with them. The risk to journalism is that other organisations, start-ups, tech companies will do things in news faster than the news world itself. Lots of start ups have no editorial component at all. They are swiping the content of news organisations, some are covering niches: they are monitoring press releases, social media channels, PDF from reports"". ""Journalism has not been doing well for the last 10 or 15 years, there hasn't really been a credible vision of the future for how this is going to play out just in the social media world. What AI does (is) it gives news organisations a chance to change that situation, to participate in a new ecosystem. It's good to be optimistic, getting engaged, exploring, having projects, experiments, maybe changing your mindset, that's positive. As Jelani Cobb, Dean of Columbia School of journalism, says: '+AI is unignorable force that journalism will have to organise itself around'. It's not going to adapt itself to journalism.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/ai-a-fundamental-change-in-the-news-ecosystem-expert/articleshow/109456421.cms
2024-04-19,"Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg calls Meta AI the most intelligent AI assistant, Elon Musk responds",TOI Tech Desk,"Meta Platforms has launched the early versions of its latest Llama 3 artificial intelligence (AI) model. This new model will be integrated with the Meta AI virtual assistant that has already started arriving to users worldwide. The social media giant’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also praised the latest model as being better than its free-to-use rivals. Top Picks For You Meta AI arrives on WhatsApp: Brings Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini-like image generation Meta AI gets new Llama 3 upgrade: How it can improve Ray-Ban smart glasses In an Instagram post, Zuckerberg said: ""With this new model, we believe Meta AI is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use.” In a blog post, the company also claimed that the new model will help the chatbot offer ""state-of-the-art"" performance on various industry-standard benchmarks and will come with ""improved reasoning.” Commenting on the launch of Meta’s latest AI model, the owner of social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Elon Musk said: “Not bad.” Meta CEO answers concerns about AI risks The company’s CEO has also explained why AI is not a risk yet. In a recent interview with The Verge, Zuckerberg said that neither Meta nor any other company, is working on a model that is sophisticated enough for humanity to be concerned. He said: “In terms of all of the concerns around the more existential risks, I don't think that anything at the level of what we or others in the field are working on in the next year is really in the ballpark of those types of risks.” It's one reason Zuckerberg feels that Meta can continue making Llama open-source to be available for the public or researchers to experiment with. Zuckerberg added that when Meta's model achieves multimodality (the ability to deliver results in various forms of media, including text, images and video) — then the company may not want to make all aspects of its model open-source. He explained: ""For example, image generation is one that we're looking at closely Especially in an election year, is that a net positive thing to do? I think that's something that we're still thinking through.” With this model, Meta aims to compete with Microsoft-backed OpenAI ’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini and Musk-owned xAI’s Grok chatbot . Meta AI with Llama 3 update will be available on the company’s popular products including WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, Messenger and even the Ray-Ban smart glasses (in the coming days).",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mark-zuckerberg-praises-meta-ai-as-the-smartest-ai-assistant-elon-musk-reacts/articleshow/109428585.cms

Mithoon on how his marriage with singer Palak Muchhal changed things for him for good ""So, I feel that any technology, any advancement has to be used with the right model space. And if it's used in the right sense, it can enhance the human performance. That's how I see it because obviously, humans cannot be replaced. Human performance cannot be replaced. I mean, if I sing a song, you may be able to take my voice, maybe yours later, but how will you get the exclusive emotion that I put into a song? If a veteran singer's voice was used, but if that person was alive, he would have done it differently. So obviously, technology cannot replace a human being, but can enhance human performance,"" added the singer. Further, expressing her perspective on AI as a tool, Palak emphasized the significance of consent when using someone's voice. She asserted that a singer's voice is a copyrighted entity and should be treated as such. ""I feel that voice is a copyright entity. If anybody's voice is being used, first of all, consent should be taken. That is basic. If you're using a voice, you cannot use it free of cost because it's a tool with which people get paid. It's a skill. You work a lot on your voice. Voice is God's gift, but then you have to work a lot on it to polish it, to make it sound suitable for different genres of songs. So, if a singer's voice is used and if the person is not alive, then the family should be taking the authority."" Palak reiterated that while AI can enhance human performance, it cannot replace the unique emotions and nuances conveyed by individual singers. She emphasized the irreplaceable essence that human performers bring to music, underscoring the importance of preserving artistic integrity in an increasingly technologically driven industry.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/news/palak-muchhal-on-the-use-of-ai-in-the-music-industry-human-performance-cannot-be-replaced-exclusive/articleshow/109396099.cms

2024-04-17,How people are using their ‘digital AI clones’ to attend Zoom meetings,TOI Tech Desk,"While tech companies are working to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI), where software will get intelligence on par with humans, an AI company is helping people create their life-like digital copy that will work for them in the real world. A company called Delphi allows users to create their digital clones using AI tools and help them work as their substitute when it comes to tasks like attending Zoom calls. According to the company co-founder, the clones look like you as well as can talk like you. Co-founder Dara Ladjevardian told DailyMail that online creators, influencers and business professionals are using Delphi to create 'clones'. How Delphi create people’s digital clones Delphi builds AI replicas by analysing data such as podcasts, videos, PDFs to mimic a person’s speech and thought patterns. This process can be completed in as little as an hour. The process involves creating a digital model of a person by 3D modelling and animation and replacing a person's face or body with an image – just like it is done in deepfakes . “The clone will learn how you think about the world. We have a readiness score to show how well your clone represents you. Additionally, users can upload their voice data to train the clone on your speech patterns,” Ladjevardian was quoted as saying. The company charges a monthly fee for digital clones, starting at $19 and up to $399. As per Ladjevardian, customers come to Delphi's ' Clone Studio ' to create a virtual version of themselves. “The clone will learn how they think about the world.

2024-04-15,How AI could revolutionize prediction of deadly dust storms in Asia,TOI World Desk,"NEW DELHI: With spring's arrival in the Northern Hemisphere, parts of Asia are once again grappling with the annual menace of dust storms , which have recently shrouded regions like China's Inner Mongolia in a thick yellow haze. On March 27, 2024, residents of Erenhot, Inner Mongolia, witnessed their skies turn murky, with state media advising people to stay indoors as winds whipped up dust with speeds reaching 100 kilometers per hour, reducing visibility to less than 90 meters. This persistent problem has prompted significant scientific engagement, particularly from Chinese researchers who have been at the forefront of developing forecasting systems for these potentially deadly natural phenomena. The latest advancements involve the application of artificial intelligence ( AI ) and climate modeling aimed at improving the accuracy and timeliness of dust storm predictions, a report in science journal Nature said. Chen Siyu, an atmospheric scientist at Lanzhou University, detailed the impact of dust storms, noting, “The dust and wind can combine to create massive, fast-moving walls of dust that travel a great distance.” These storms are not just vast curtains of dust; they also carry bacteria and toxic metals, posing serious health and environmental hazards. In fact, during such events, mortality from cardiovascular diseases can surge by 25%, and respiratory problems by 18%. Chen's team at Lanzhou University has developed an early-warning system named the Dust Watcher, utilizing AI to predict the timing and severity of incoming dust storms up to 12 hours in advance across 13 Asian countries. “AI can learn how dust storms evolve in time and space from a large amount of data,” explained Huang Jianping, a distinguished professor at the university. In a trial run, the Dust Watcher achieved 13% fewer errors compared to non-AI models. Despite the challenges of forecasting, innovations like the Dust Watcher are proving to be crucial. Wang Zifa, an atmospheric physicist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, emphasized the severe effects of dust storms in East Asia due to the region’s dense population. The efforts to refine these predictions are continuous, with Jin Jianbing from Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology developing a 48-hour forecast system that integrates observational data dynamically to enhance prediction accuracy, the Nature report said. The relationship between climate change and dust storms adds another layer of complexity. While some studies suggest that climate phenomena like Arctic amplification might reduce dust levels by altering wind patterns, others indicate changing climate conditions could exacerbate the situation. Gao Meng, a co-author of a recent study, highlighted the delicate balance climate change plays in influencing dust storm patterns.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/how-ai-could-revolutionize-prediction-of-deadly-dust-storms-in-asia/articleshow/109321279.cms
2024-04-15,IIT-Kharagpur set to start BTech course in AI,Dipawali Mitra,"KOLKATA: IIT-Kharagpur, the oldest IIT in the country, is set to introduce a four-year BTech course in artificial intelligence (AI) from this academic session. After a gap of more than two decades, IIT-Kharagpur is floating a BTech course and it is the first among the big five IITs to start a course in AI. The institute has already started ramping up its infrastructure and lab facilities. Sources said the institute's Senate has approved the decision. The ministry's approval is yet to arrive. A Senate member said, ""The admission to the course will be through JEE Advanced and the intake capacity will be 30 students initially."" IIT-KGP also offers MTech and interdisciplinary dual-degree (MTech) in AI. In 2020, the institute had decided that every student will take a course on AI. Sources said that there are five pillars on which the four-year BTech programme has been developed. ""During the course, a student will get to learn mathematical foundations of AI, algorithmic foundations and architectural foundations of machine learning. Since AI has developed or progressed in two broad verticals - language and image, the fourth component will be based on AI in language and AI in image. The fifth component will focus on applications in various fields like AI in agriculture, healthcare, finance, manufacturing and others,"" said a professor. He said the students who will pursue BTech in AI will have an edge over those pursuing computer science engineering in the long run and will help them to bag premium jobs. Students also feel that those who have effective knowledge in AI and machine learning have got good jobs with high-salary packages. An official said the authorities did a survey among students and industries to find out the growing interest and demand in the discipline. ""This prompted us to start this course because the length and breadth of the discipline can only be covered in a four-year programme,"" said a source. 'Will shift to take up three floors of new building ' The institute is also planning to convert its Centre for Excellence In Artificial Intelligence into a department of AI . ""We will be shifting into a new building where three floors have been allocated for us. The work of ramping up infrastructure and setting up modern laboratories is underway. Big GPU servers and workstations will also be installed,"" a source said. In the long-run, the source added, they are planning to build a new building with support from the alumni.

2024-04-14,How Google’s AI team taught robots to play football,TOI Tech Desk,"The use cases of artificial intelligence (AI) are not limited to chatbots. Companies are also imparting training to models that in turn bring robots to life and help humans in various tasks. Google, in a slightly different approach, has taught robots to play football. Google DeepMind , the company’s AI arm, trained its AI agents for a bipedal robot to demonstrate a range of agile behaviours using reinforcement learning. “Soccer players have to master a range of dynamic skills, from turning and kicking to chasing a ball. How could robots do the same?” Google DeepMind said in a post on X. How Google trained model to train robots like football players In a paper published in journal Science, the company explains that generating robust motor skills in bipedal robots in the real world is challenging because of the inability of current control methods to generalise to specific tasks. Hence, a team of researchers created a deep reinforcement learning framework for controlling the entire body of humanoid robots. This framework allowed the robots to play one-on-one soccer. The robots developed new behaviours on their own, including dynamic movements like recovering from falls and strategic tactics like defending the ball. The robots, using this framework, moved faster than those with a traditional scripted controller. This suggests the framework may be useful for even more complex interactions between multiple robots. “Robotics has long used games like soccer to test complex motion, coordination and environment awareness. Our agents were trained in simulation using the MuJoCo physics engine, and then transferred to small humanoid robots with 20 actuated joints,” it said. The team said that this helped robots achieve faster walking, turning, kicking, and standing compared to robots with pre-programmed skills. Additionally, they demonstrated the ability to combine these movements to score goals, anticipate the ball's trajectory, and block opponent shots.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-googles-ai-team-taught-robots-to-play-football/articleshow/109288571.cms

2024-04-11,Simplifying maths with hacks used by ethnic groups,TNN,"Prayagraj: A team of academicians, including an assistant professor of Allahabad University, have designed a unique device that uses Indian folklore and traditional knowledge and is powered by artificial intelligence (AI) to teach mathematics to school children easily and creatively. The device was recently granted design patent by Govt of India. The compact device with a 17-inch screen has been developed jointly by academicians of different institutes of the country. The device took around a year to develop and it uses traditional knowledge to engage students in practical learning experiences through interactive activities, puzzles, and simulations to reinforce mathematical concepts and enhance critical thinking skills. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, will greatly improve math instructions for students of classes 6 to 8, the stage at which students develop a base of learning mathematics. The device works on ‘ ethnomathematics ’ and is developed by Manish Kumar Gautam, assistant professor at education department of Allahabad University, along with Harish Pandey, assistant professor at education department of Mahatma Gandhi Antarrashtriya Hindi Vishwavidyalaya, Wardha, Prof Kaushal Kishore of education department, Jamia Millia Islamia University, New Delhi and Kishore Kumar, assistant professor in education department of Central University of South Bihar, Gaya. “Has anyone ever trained a potter to make an earthen pot of exactly 2 litre of capacity, or, a fisherman to throw the net at a perfect angle to maximise its reach? These are traditional mathematical skills followed in ethnic groups and they are passed on from one generations to another,” said Gautam, while talking to TOI, on Wednesday. He added that his friends in IIT-Delhi was working on how to integrate artificial intelligence technology with the tool which will improve technique of instructions for students of classes 6 to 8. Though the prototype developed by researchers cost Rs 20,000, they believe, its mass production and development of software would reduce the price to half. Team member and ethnomathematical teaching-learning researcher, Harish Pandey, said after being equipped with AI, this learning machine would analyse students’ strengths, weaknesses and learning patterns and present teaching-learning material and instructions accordingly. Gautam said ethnomathematics was a part of mathematics linked between formal concepts and practice in culture, so understanding of topics is easier because the topic is related directly to culture and daily routine. “The aim is to tell that there are other and different ways of calculation and using mathematics, which has been confined to formal education in schools . With the ethnomathematics approach, students would be able to construct an understanding of societal cultures,” he said.

In an interview on X Spaces this week, the Tesla CEO discussed the development of AI technology and predicted that AGI will surpass human intelligence within the next year or two. “If you define AGI (artificial general intelligence) as smarter than the smartest human, I think it's probably next year, within two years,” Musk said when asked about the timeline for development of AGI. He was talking to Norway wealth fund CEO Nicolai Tangen. AGI is a type of AI that can perform equal to or better than humans on a wide range of cognitive tasks. Limitations to AGI development Musk, who also co-founded OpenAI, a research company focused on beneficial AI, mentioned limitations in training his company xAI's chatbot Grok due to a lack of advanced chips. He stated that training the current Grok model required 20,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, and future versions will need significantly more. While chip shortages have been a major obstacle so far, Musk also believes electricity availability will become a critical factor in the near future – something that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has also talked about. This is not the first time that Musk has shared this timeline. Previously, he reposted a video clip of Joe Rogan podcast in which Rogan was talking to Raymond Kurzweil, an American computer scientist and futurist. Kurzweil tells Joe Rogan that AI will achieve human-level intelligence by 2029. “We're not quite there, but we will be there, and by 2029 it will match any person,” he said, adding, “I'm actually considered conservative.

According to a report by CNBC, the company is planning to build the AI centre in Indonesia and has also partnered with local telco giant Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison . In a statement (seen by CNBC), Indonesia’s Communication and Information Technology Minister, Budi Arie Setiadi has confirmed that the new facility will be based in the city of Surakarta in the Central Java province. Top Picks For You Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on why tech industry needs more 'powerful' AI chips How Nvidia's Blackwell superchip could fuel an AI revolution The minister also said that the AI centre is expected to boost local telecommunications infrastructure, human resources and digital talent. The report noted that both Indosat and Nvidia have yet to comment on this development. Last month, Indosat announced that it was ready to integrate Nvidia’s next-generation chip architecture, Blackwell , into its infrastructure. The telco said that “the goal of propelling Indonesia into a new era of sovereign AI and technological advancement.” Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison became Indonesia’s second-largest mobile telco after Qatar’s Ooredoo and Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison merged in 2022.

2024-04-07,"‘Quick, low-cost plans’: AI to help GMDA repair roads","Apr 7, 2024, 04:20 IST","Gurgaon: GMDA is planning to step up road maintenance by adopting solutions based on artificial intelligence (AI). Once implemented, the initiative will be the first of its kind in Haryana. The authority has invited bids for engaging an agency that will be given the task of conducting surveys and monitoring and maintaining roads using AI technology. At present, GMDA has a road network spread over 300km in the city, which is being managed through manual surveys and later estimates prepared for carrying out repairs as per the requirement. With the adoption of AI, GMDA officials, the metropolitan authority wants to enhance efficiency and cost-effectiveness in road maintenance operations. The shift is also expected to drastically reduce reliance on extensive manpower traditionally required for the task. The agency will deploy a vehicle equipped with all-weather cameras to record video footage with GPS location tags. It will be able to capture potholes, cracks and patches. It will assess shortcomings in the road furniture such as missing or faded lane markers, boundary markers, kerb paint, road signs and zebra crossings. The vehicle will also spot and record missing or damaged speed breakers, median vegetation and streetlights. ""GMDA is working towards adopting AI-based tech to carry out surveys to gauge road conditions in the city and to detect areas where repair work or upgrades are required. The survey will be conducted every month. This will also aid us in monitoring whether the required repair work has been undertaken or completed. AI-based solutions will support better monitoring and maintenance, as well as reduce dependency on human intervention,” said PK Aggarwal, head of GMDA’s Smart City division. According to the official, the selected agency will be assigned with a task of conducting 12 surveys each month for a year, covering the entire 300km road network that falls under GMDA’s jurisdiction. This will provide comprehensive “road health” data, which will be sent to GMDA’s integrated command and control centre (ICCC). Based on this data, the AI software will be able to generate area estimations for potholes and cracks, which will help in the preparation of detailed project reports (DPRs) for road repairs. It will automate survey processing and generate detailed reports, ensuring ease of use through a mobile survey application, a senior official said. The agency will develop an integrated dashboard which will provide a comprehensive overview of roads in the city At present, GMDA staffers carry out surveys and prepare estimates for road maintenance projects once a year, which takes 15 to 30 days. Following this, the process of floating tenders and selecting an agency to execute the work also takes another 2-3 months. The adoption of AI is expected to quicken this process and reduce costs. “Under this project, we will receive monthly reports on road conditions, which will help us address deficiencies early on. At present, surveys are conducted visually, which can miss certain issues like uneven road surfaces. Mechanised surveys, on the other hand, can detect these problems, allowing for timely repairs that can prevent roads from deteriorating further and, as a result, reduce maintenance costs. For example, a small pothole that appears and is left unattended for 15 days can expand, leading to increased repair costs. Timely intervention is crucial for cost-effectiveness,” an official from GMDA’s infra-1 division said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/quick-low-cost-plans-ai-to-help-gmda-repair-roads/articleshow/109096673.cms
2024-04-07,Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg’s beats Tesla CEO Elon Musk in this 'rich list' for the first time since 2020,TOI Tech Desk,"Mark Zuckerberg has overtaken Elon Musk as the world's third-richest person, marking a shift in the fortunes of these tech titans. This is the first time since 2020 that these two rivals have occupied these positions on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Tesla Struggles, Meta Soars Musk's wealth has dipped due to recent challenges at Tesla. A Reuters report about the cancellation of a planned affordable car model, coupled with a decline in vehicle deliveries, sent Tesla shares tumbling (a claim Musk refuted). This year alone, Musk's wealth has shrunk by $48.4 billion. In stark contrast, Zuckerberg's fortune has grown by a substantial $58.9 billion. Meta Platforms Inc. , the parent company of Facebook, has been experiencing strong performance with record highs and positive quarterly earnings. Additionally, investor excitement around Meta's advancements in artificial intelligence has further fueled its rise. Meta's stock price has surged 49% this year, making it one of the top performers in the S&P 500. This shift in wealth standings reflects a broader trend. The once-red-hot electric vehicle sector, led by Tesla, appears to be cooling down, facing issues like slowing global EV demand, increased competition in China, and production problems. Meanwhile, big tech companies, particularly those focused on artificial intelligence, are experiencing a resurgence. A Rivalry Beyond Wealth The rivalry between Musk and Zuckerberg extends beyond the wealth ranking. They've been engaged in a public spat for years, which intensified when Meta launched Threads, a social media platform competing with Musk's X. Their barbs even included a playful exchange on Twitter about a potential ""cage fight."" Looking Ahead While Musk's net worth might take a further hit due to a recent court ruling striking down his $55 billion Tesla pay package, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index still factors in the options from that package as part of his wealth calculation.

Kirby, in the CNN interview, said the U.S. had not verified the content of the media report published in +972 Magazine and Local Call on Wednesday. It cited Israeli intelligence officials involved in the reported program known as ""Lavender."" The media report said the Israeli army had marked tens of thousands of Gazans as suspects for assassination, using the AI system with little human oversight. The Israeli Defense Forces denies that AI was used to identify suspected extremists and targets. ""The IDF does not use an artificial intelligence system that identifies terrorist operatives or tries to predict whether a person is a terrorist. Information systems are merely tools for analysts in the target identification process,"" the IDF said in a statement. The statement added that IDF directives mandate analysts to conduct independent examinations, in which they verify that the identified targets meet the relevant definitions in line with international law and Israeli guidelines. Kirby, in the CNN interview, was also asked about reports that the Israeli security cabinet had approved the opening of the Erez crossing with Gaza to allow more humanitarian aid to enter. Kirby said the opening of the crossing would be ""welcome news"" and ""certainly in keeping"" with what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. President Joe Biden in their call on Thursday. The White House said that Biden, in the call, threatened to condition support for Israel 's offensive in Gaza on its taking concrete steps to protect aid workers and civilians. Palestinian Islamist group Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's subsequent military assault on Hamas-governed Gaza has killed over 32,000 people, according to the local health ministry, displaced nearly all of its 2.3 million population, caused a starvation crisis, and led to genocide allegations that Israel denies.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-looking-at-report-that-israel-used-ai-to-identify-bombing-targets-in-gaza/articleshow/109075760.cms

According to the Financial Times, Google is exploring different options, including the addition of certain AI-powered search features to its existing premium subscription services, which already offer access to the new Gemini AI assistant in Gmail and Docs . However, Google executives have not yet decided whether or when to launch the service, one of the sources tell the Financial Times. ""We're not working on or considering an ad-free search experience,"" Google said in a statement to the Financial Times. ""As we've done many times before, we'll continue to build new premium capabilities and services to enhance our subscription offerings across Google."" The move would represent a significant shift for Google, which has traditionally offered free consumer services funded entirely by advertising . The company reported $175 billion in revenue from search and related ads last year, accounting for more than half its total sales. Faced with the ChatGPT threat, Google started piloting an AI-driven search service, "" Search Generative Experience "" (SGE), last year. SGE provides in-depth responses to queries alongside traditional search results and ads. However, as per the report, the high computing costs of generative AI have made Google hesitant to integrate these features into its primary search engine fully, and that could be why Google is looking to charge users for it. Google's traditional search engine would remain free of charge, tell the sources, with ads continuing to appear alongside search results even for subscribers. Charging for AI-powered search features shows the difficulties Google is having in using the newest AI technology while still making money the way it always have.

2024-04-02,From Pune to the cosmos: India to play a key role in search for aliens,TOI Science Desk,"NEW DELHI: Indian astronomers are poised to play a pivotal role in the global effort of the 16-nation Square Kilometer Array Observatory ( SKAO ), an ambitious venture set to embark on scanning the cosmos in 2027. India, which joined the consortium in January, is among the key contributors to what is hailed as the largest telescope project of the 21st century, combining the forces of radio astronomy and artificial intelligence (AI) to explore cosmic phenomena including the lifecycle of stars, habitable planets, and the potential for extraterrestrial life, a report in Russia Today said. The SKAO, with a budget of €2.2 billion ($2.4 billion), includes member nations such as South Africa, Australia, the UK, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. India has allocated Rs 12.5 billion ($150 million) for the establishment of a regional data center in Pune, a city renowned for its radio astronomy research. This center will house supercomputers tasked with processing the vast scientific data collected by the telescope, the RT report said. Utilizing radio interferometry, the SKAO will integrate signals from numerous antennas across large distances to produce images of unprecedented clarity and brightness. This network of antennas, spanning continents, aims to document cosmic phenomena to fill the equivalent of 1.5 million laptops annually with data.

We will use this to develop a small model demonstrating that India is ready to receive and analyze the data,"" said Prof Yashwant Gupta, director of the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA) in Pune. The SKAO's construction sites include South Africa's Karoo region and Western Australia, chosen for their remoteness to minimize signal interference. The first components of the telescope's dish array antennas were installed in early March, with full operational capability expected by 2027. What is the Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO)? The Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) is an international effort to build the world's largest radio telescope, aiming to explore the universe in unprecedented detail. It involves the collaboration of multiple countries and is one of the most ambitious astronomy projects of the 21st century. The project seeks to provide answers to some of the most fundamental questions about the universe, including the nature of gravity, the search for life beyond Earth, and the mysteries of dark energy and dark matter. The SKAO is not a single telescope but rather a collection of thousands of antennas and dishes spread over long distances, creating a total collecting area of approximately one square kilometer, hence its name. It will have two major components: one located in South Africa, consisting of mid-frequency dish antennas, and the other in Western Australia, composed of low-frequency antennas. The array's design allows for an immense field of view and the capability to survey the sky more than ten thousand times faster than has ever been done. By combining signals from many antennas spread over vast distances, SKAO will effectively create a telescope with a diameter of thousands of kilometers, providing astronomers with sharp and sensitive images of the sky in radio wavelengths. Radio astronomy, the field SKAO will advance, observes the universe in radio frequencies, allowing scientists to study celestial phenomena that are not visible with optical telescopes, including the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies, the cosmic web, and potentially the signatures of extraterrestrial life.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/from-pune-to-the-cosmos-india-to-play-a-key-role-in-search-for-aliens/articleshow/108969829.cms
2024-04-01,"AI-generated deepfake videos, voice cloning emerge as potential threats during election season",PTI,"NEW DELHI: As political parties go all out to woo voters ahead of the general elections, cybersecurity experts have raised concern over the possible misuse of artificial intelligence and deepfake technology, among others, to influence the electorate. Lok Sabha polls in India will take place in seven phases between April 19 and June 1. The Election Commission of India has already issued standard operating procedures for identification and quick response to fake news and misinformation. ""Deepfake videos and voice cloning are two tools that could be massively used during the election campaign,"" a senior officer of the Delhi Police's cyber crimes unit said. He believes that a major challenge before the police is timely detection of such content and taking prompt action. There is no technology available that can automatically detect and differentiate between original and fake video content created using artificial intelligence (AI). ""By the time it gets noticed, the damage is already done because it gets spread on social media ,"" the officer said. In January 2024, during the New Hampshire primary of the Democratic Party in the US, a robocall mimicking President Joe Biden's voice falsely advised voters not to participate, claiming it would affect their eligibility for the general election. In Slovakia, an AI-generated voice, mimicking that of a liberal candidate, discussing plans to raise alcohol prices and rig the election was widely circulated on Facebook. Similarly, a manipulated audio clip falsely implicated a presidential candidate in plans to manipulate ballots during the Nigerian elections of February 2023. In Bangladesh, deepfake videos of opposition politicians Rumin Farhana in a bikini and Nipun Roy in a swimming pool surfaced on social media ahead of the national elections. Former Indian Police Service (IPS) officer and cybersecurity expert Triveni Singh said the widespread dissemination of AI-generated misinformation can erode public trust in the electoral process and democratic institutions. The government should engage with stakeholders, including cybersecurity experts, tech companies and civil society organisations, to develop transparent and fair guidelines for evaluating and approving AI tools, Singh said. Talking about the measures being taken to tackle the potential danger that AI poses during elections, he said the Centre has made the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C) the nodal agency for taking down objectionable online content. As soon police from any state inform the I4C about malicious content online, they will reach out to the social media companies to get the content deleted, Singh added. Cyber crime units of state police are also patrolling online to identify fake news or inappropriate content, he said. Singh suggested that security agencies can create specialised teams equipped with tools to detect and analyse deepfake and voice cloning. These teams should be available round the clock, especially during critical periods such as elections. He also urged the authorities to conduct awareness campaigns to educate voters about deepfakes and voice cloning and on ways to critically evaluate information on social media. Shashank Shekhar, co-founder of Future Crime Research Foundation, a think-tank incubated at IIT-Kanpur, said law enforcement agencies work closely with social media companies to detect and remove malicious content. Promptly identifying AI-generated content or synthetic video/audio remains the biggest challenge, he said. AI-powered misinformation campaigns can influence voter behaviour by spreading false narratives or amplifying divisive content, he said. Detecting the source of the AI-generated content is another challenge. Many foreign countries have an interest in Indian elections and the possibility of large-scale manipulations from these countries cannot be ruled out, Shekhar said. According to an Election Commission official, social media cells have been constituted in collaboration with cyber cells in all districts for quick response and action within the legal framework. The commission has requested all political parties and candidates to ensure that their supporters do not spread fake news. Strict watch on social media is being kept by the poll body's Media Certification and Monitoring Committee to ensure that the election atmosphere is not vitiated, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ai-generated-deepfake-videos-voice-cloning-emerge-as-potential-threats-during-election-season/articleshow/108944586.cms
2024-04-01,Will artificial intelligence boost productivity? Companies sure hope so.,NYT News Service,"Wendy’s menu boards. Ben & Jerry’s grocery store freezers. Abercrombie & Fitch’s marketing. Many mainstays of the American customer experience are increasingly powered by artificial intelligence . The question is whether the technology will actually make companies more efficient. Rapid productivity improvement is the dream for both companies and economic policymakers. If output per hour holds steady, firms must either sacrifice profits or raise prices to pay for wage increases or investment projects. But when firms figure out how to produce more per working hour, it means that they can maintain or expand profits even as they pay or invest more. Economies experiencing productivity booms can experience rapid wage gains and quick growth without as much risk of rapid inflation. But many economists and officials seem dubious that AI — especially generative AI, which is still in its infancy — has spread enough to show up in productivity data already. Jerome Powell , the Federal Reserve chair, recently suggested that AI “may” have the potential to increase productivity growth, “but probably not in the short run.” John Williams , president of the New York Fed, has made similar remarks, specifically citing the work of Northwestern University economist Robert Gordon . Gordon has argued that new technologies in recent years, while important, have probably not been transformative enough to give a lasting lift to productivity growth. “The enthusiasm about large language models and ChatGPT has gone a bit overboard,” he said in an interview. The last time productivity really picked up, in the 1990s, computer manufacturing was getting a lot more efficient at the same time that computers themselves were making everything else more efficient — allowing for a sector-spanning productivity increase . Today’s gains may be less broad, he thinks. Other economists are more optimistic. Erik Brynjolfsson at Stanford University has bet Gordon $400 that productivity will take off this decade. His optimism is based partly on AI. He ran an experiment with it at a large call center, where it especially helped less-experienced workers, and has co-founded a company meant to teach firms how to leverage the technology.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-artificial-intelligence-boost-productivity-companies-sure-hope-so-/articleshow/108953637.cms
2024-03-30,"OpenAI introduces Voice Engine, AI that can clone your voice in 15 seconds",TOI Tech Desk,"OpenAI , a company known for creating AI that can write texts and create pictures and videos, has now created a new AI called Voice Engine . This AI can copy a person's voice by listening to just 15 seconds of them talking. It can then use that copied voice to say anything you want, even in different languages. Only a small group of companies are getting to test Voice Engine. These companies are using it to help people who can't read, translate things into other languages, and even help people who have lost their ability to speak. To make a copy of someone's voice, Voice Engine only needs a short recording of them talking and some text to read. The voices it makes sound very real and can even show emotions. OpenAI says that it is being careful about letting people use Voice Engine because they know it could be used in bad ways, like tricking people or pretending to be someone else. They are apprehensive about this because it's an election year, and fake voices could be used to spread false information. The companies testing Voice Engine have to follow strict rules. They can't use it to copy someone's voice without their permission, and they have to let people know when a voice is made by AI. OpenAI has also put special marks on the audio made by Voice Engine so they can always tell where it came from. They are working with the government and other experts to figure out the best way to use this technology safely. For now, only a few companies, about only 10, can experiment with Voice Engine while OpenAI keeps working on improving and making it safer. They want to be sure they understand all the possible effects before letting everyone use it. ""We’re curious about making it publicly available, but obviously, that comes with added risks in terms of exposure and breaking it,"" Jeff Harris, a product staff at OpenAI, told TechCrunch in an interview.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-introduces-voice-engine-ai-that-can-clone-your-voice-in-15-seconds/articleshow/108890137.cms

In an interaction with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates , he spoke on a range of issues from artificial intelligence, use of technology , to climate change, renewable energy, digital public infrastructure and women's empowerment. The interaction between the PM and Gates was webcast on news agency ANI's YouTube channel. ""If such a good thing (AI) is given to someone without proper training, it is likely to be misused. It's crucial to acknowledge that deep fake content is AI-generated. We need to think about some dos and don'ts,"" Modi said while detailing how India has used technology to ensure ease of living for people. India has backed global cooperation and rules for regulating AI, pointing to the negative use of the technology and the dangers posed by deep fakes to society and individuals. In a lighter vein, PM told Gates that in many states a mother is called 'Aai'. ""Now I say when a child is born, he or she says 'aai' and 'AI' also. This is how advanced it is."" Modi said his govt has used technology across sectors and taken it to people. ""I had decided that I would not let the digital divide hamper progress. Digital public infrastructure is a big requirement in itself. Today, I am extending digital facilities to all our villages,"" said Modi and referred to the use of technology in healthcare, farming and education. The PM said that during the G20 Summit in Indonesia, representatives from around the world expressed their curiosity about the digital revolution in India. ""I explained to them that we have democratised technology to prevent monopoly. It is by the people and for the people."" Modi said that data security remains a key concern, and emphasised that while India has a strong legal framework in place, public awareness was equally important. ""We need to train the common man for quality data. Second, the data-owner must be informed about the intentions behind data requests. If the requester aims to monetise the data through agreements, consent should be given.

2024-03-30,Microsoft and ChatGPT maker OpenAI plan $100 billion AI supercomputer ‘Stargate’,TOI Tech Desk,"Microsoft and OpenAI are reportedly planning a massive data-centre project that could cost up to $100 billion, including the development of an artificial intelligence supercomputer called "" Stargate ,"" according to a report by The Information. The project is said to be financed by Microsoft. The proposed efforts, as per the source who has seen the initial cost estimates, could exceed $115 billion, more than triple Microsoft's capital expenditures on servers, buildings, and equipment last year. The alleged supercomputer would be the largest in a series of installations the companies plan to build over the next six years. Microsoft is expected to finance the project, which would be 100 times more expensive than some of the biggest current data centres, as reported by The Information, citing individuals involved in private discussions about the proposal. OpenAI's next major AI upgrade is anticipated to arrive by early next year, with Microsoft executives aiming to launch Stargate as early as 2028. The Information attributed the tentative $100 billion cost to an individual who spoke with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and another who viewed some of Microsoft's initial cost estimates. ""We are always planning for the next generation of infrastructure innovations needed to continue pushing the frontier of AI capability,"" Frank Shaw, a Microsoft spokesperson, told The Information in a statement. Altman and Microsoft employees have reportedly divided the supercomputers into five phases, with Stargate being the fifth. Microsoft is currently working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI, targeting a 2026 launch. The two companies are presently in the middle of the third phase of the five-phase plan, with a significant portion of the cost for the next two phases involving the procurement of necessary AI chips, according to The Information.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-and-chatgpt-maker-openai-plan-100-billion-ai-supercomputer-stargate/articleshow/108889439.cms
2024-03-28,How Nvidia's Blackwell superchip could fuel an AI revolution,Deutsche Welle,"Chipmaker Nvidia has released a new superchip that it says will turbocharge artificial intelligence . Is this the start of a new power-hungry industrial revolution? It wasn't a concert — Taylor Swift was nowhere to be seen. Still, thousands of people packed an arena in San Jose, California, to listen and cheer on March 18. The star of this show was Jensen Huang , who was on stage showing off a new chip that would be launched later in the year. His two-hour performance has since been watched by nearly 27 million people on YouTube. Huang, CEO and co-founder of Nvidia, presented in his customary black leather jacket at the company's annual developer conference. Though still not a household name beyond the tech community, Nvidia caused waves recently after its market capitalization topped $2 trillion (€1.84 trillion), making it the third-most valuable listed company in the US behind Microsoft and Apple. All this is linked to the company's semiconductors, called graphics processor units (GPUs). Nvidia is a chip designer — and outsources chipmaking to expert manufacturers. Its hardware was initially used for video gaming, but the company found other options like cryptocurrency mining, 3-D modeling and self-driving vehicles. Most importantly, they pivoted to integrating their chips into generative artificial intelligence (GAI) systems — a form of self-learning artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images, or other media. At first glance, technology just for artificial intelligence (AI) may seem like a short road, but the possibilities around the technology have taken the world by storm since the introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022. Today, Nvidia's biggest customers are cloud-computing titans and companies that build AI models. The new Blackwell superchip Through its know-how, Nvidia has the chance to power this transformative technology. Currently, it holds around 80% of the global market for such AI chips. The new chip presented in California is called Blackwell. With 208 billion transistors, it is an upgrade of the company's H100 chip, which Huang said is currently the most advanced GPU in production. The next-generation chip is 30 times quicker at some tasks than its predecessor. To develop Blackwell, the company spent around $10 billion, according to Huang. Each chip will cost $30,000-$40,000. The company hopes its newest product will increase its hold on the AI chip market. How does the technology work? The Blackwell chip is part of an advanced system that the company says can be used ""for trillion-parameter scale generative AI."" The chips break tasks into small pieces. This parallel processing makes it possible to work out calculations faster. The new chip has a number of features that reduce both latency and energy use, says Bibhu Datta Sahoo, a professor who works at the University at Buffalo Center for Advanced Semiconductor Technologies. Among other features, the Blackwell chip enables connecting many GPUs so that large AI models can be trained with a smaller carbon footprint. And it incorporates accelerated decompression of most major data formats, which enables the shift of data processing from different types of chips. Asked if the chip could change the world, Sahoo told DW that it is difficult to say with so many teams working on things that could revolutionize AI model training. Nonetheless, ""the Blackwell chip is a very good step in the right direction."" More power, less energy For Huang change cannot come fast enough pointing out that general-purpose computing has run out of steam and accelerated computing has reached a turning point. The world is seeing the start of a new industrial revolution, he said in San Jose. Creative ways need to be found to scale up while driving down costs so society can ""consume more and more computing while being sustainable."" To make this possible, data centers need to grow and become more powerful. But some fear power-hungry AI chips will just add to energy use and strain grids. Nvidia sees the problem and says its new chip — though more powerful — is more energy efficient. Experts agree. Based on available data, the Blackwell chip can reduce energy consumption by a factor of 3 to 4 compared to the previous generation of GPUs for training large AI models, said Sahoo. This energy efficiency is especially important ""considering the fact that the power consumption of data centers in the US is expected to reach 35 GW by 2030, up from 17 GW in 2022."" The road ahead is not without roadblocks Despite all the advancements in building powerful chips for the next generation of AI, some have their doubts and fear a financial bubble as investors pile in. AI hardware makers have, so far, seen the biggest boom. This is natural since the underlying infrastructure must be in place before software can be used. Now that the infrastructure is coming into place, the technology can expand. To secure its position, Nvidia is ramping up investments in its networking and software offerings to connect and manage its superchip hardware. Yet the future holds a number of other challenges. Growing demand for semiconductors could put a strain on global supply chains. Most precarious is the fact that so much chip manufacturing is based in Taiwan. Finally, the competition is not waiting to see what happens. Big rivals like Intel and AMD plus startups Cerebras and Groq are all working on their own chips. Even Nvidia's biggest customers — Amazon, Google and Microsoft — are getting into the chip design business. In an industry where size matters and new technology is quickly outdated, it will be an expensive race to stay on top.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/how-nvidias-blackwell-superchip-could-fuel-an-ai-revolution/articleshow/108842392.cms
2024-03-27,"""We will get there within 5 years,"" says Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang about when to expect human-level AI",TOI Tech Desk,"During Nvidia 's annual GTC conference, the company's CEO, Jensen Huang , discussed the future of advanced artificial intelligence and shared his thoughts on when it might arrive. Huang stated that if advanced AI is defined as a computer program that can perform specific tests, like passing a legal or medical exam, better than most people, it could happen within the next five years. “If we specified AGI to be something very specific, a set of tests where a software program can do very well — or maybe 8% better than most people — I believe we will get there within 5 years,” Huang said. Advanced AI, also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI) and often referred to as “human-level AI, “could perform many different tasks at the same level as humans or even better. However, this raises questions about what role humans will play in a future where machines can outthink and outperform them in almost every area. Huang stressed the need to clearly define AGI to accurately predict when it will arrive. He compared it to recognizing a place by its signs or knowing when New Year's Day happens. Without a specific definition, Huang didn't want to make any firm predictions about when AGI would be here. Solving AI mistakes During the Q&A session, Huang also talked about the issue of AI hallucinations, where AI systems provide answers that sound correct but are actually wrong. He expressed frustration with the question and suggested that hallucinations can be easily solved by implementing a ""retrieval-augmented generation"" approach. This method involves instructing the AI to research and verify its answers before providing them, similar to basic media literacy practices. Huang proposed making the AI look up the answer for every question and compare the facts to what is already known as true. If the answer is slightly inaccurate, the AI should disregard that source and look for another one. For critical answers, like health advice, Huang suggested checking multiple trusted sources to ensure the information is accurate. He also said that AI systems should be able to admit when they don't know the answer, can't agree on the right answer, or are unable to provide information about future events that have yet to occur. Looking to the future The development of AGI has been a topic of discussion in the AI world for a long time. While some experts believe AGI is still far off, others, like Huang, are more optimistic about its arrival. As AI technology continues to improve rapidly, the discussion about AGI and how it will affect society is likely to grow.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/we-will-get-there-within-5-years-says-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-about-when-to-expect-human-level-ai/articleshow/108651837.cms

Apple's approach to implementing generative AI across its products might be closer than one would imagine, and we might get a smorgasbord of “Absolutely Incredible” announcements on June 10. Rumour has it that the iPhone maker has been secretly investing billions of dollars in developing its own generative AI products, including a mysterious large language model framework called Ajax and a chatbot known internally as Apple GPT . The iPhone maker company has also been quietly acquiring AI startups, such as the Canadian firm DarwinAI, to bolster its capabilities in this field. Greg Joswiak , the SVP of marketing at Apple, posted on X, reading ""It's going to be Absolutely Incredible,"" when announcing the event. While it could simply mean that the developer’s conference is going to be “absolutely incredible,” everyone on the internet think it is a playful nod to AI announcements. Duh, “Absolutely Incredible,” “AI.” But why is Apple's AI revelation at WWDC so crucial? For starters, investors are starting to feel the heat as Apple appears to lag in the Gen AI race. With rivals like Microsoft and Google already making significant strides in generative AI, Apple needs to catch up to them before it gets too late. And, with a slurry of cancelled projects in recent weeks, Apple needs something new to keep its investors happy. What could be better than AI, right? While Apple isn't planning to debut its own generative AI chatbot just yet (sorry, Siri , you'll have to wait your turn), the company is expected to unveil a slew of new features powered by AI to assist users in their daily lives. The iPhone maker is reportedly working behind the scenes to strike deals with Google, OpenAI, or Baidu (for China) to AI features while it readies it’s own model. The iOS 18 update, in particular, is rumoured to be the “most ambitious overhaul” of the iPhone's software in its history, with AI playing a central role in enhancing user experience. But wait, there's more. WWDC 2024 won’t just be going to be about AI. Apple will also showcase the latest versions of software for its other products, including the iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and macOS for Macs.

Almost every tech companies is embracing AI and the big ones are investing billions of dollars. A key part of ‘winning’ the AI race might be securing talent that can deliver. According to a report by The Information, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has allegedly taken to personally emailing AI researchers at Google ’s DeepMind to entice them to join his company. According to the report, Zuckerberg’s emails detail the pivotal role AI plays at Meta and express his desire for these experts to collaborate directly with him. This personal touch is part of a broader initiative by Meta to become a leading force in AI development, a goal that Zuckerberg has publicly emphasised as a priority for the company. Meta is clearly using unconventional methods as the direct involvement of its CEO for recruiting people isn’t really a common practice. The Information report further reveals that Meta has offered positions to some candidates without the standard interview process, signalling a sense of urgency and confidence in the talent they’re pursuing. The company has also reportedly relaxed its salary policies, now willing to offer higher compensation to individuals with competing job offers. This shift indicates a significant change in Meta’s approach to hiring, likely driven by the high stakes of AI innovation and the need to attract the best minds in the field. Zuckerberg’s commitment to AI was further highlighted in an interview with The Verge earlier this year, where he disclosed Meta’s plans to acquire over 340,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs by the end of 2024. These GPUs are crucial for training and deploying AI models, and such a large-scale acquisition demonstrates Meta’s intent to scale up its AI capabilities. “We have built up the capacity to do this at a scale that may be larger than any other individual company.

One recent addition is a feature on Instagram that allows users to change the background of their Story photos using AI. Instagram’s AI-backdrop feature Dubbed as “AI Backdrop”, this feature is reminiscent of AI platforms like DALL-E or Midjourney, allowing users to swap out backgrounds in their Instagram Story photos with just a few taps. Instagram will check your photo's parts like the background, people, and others. It may take a moment. You can pick which areas to keep in your new backdrop. Everything else will be replaced. Although currently available to select users, Meta is planning to roll out this feature to all users in the coming weeks. How to use the AI-backdrop feature to enhance your Instagram Story Once the AI background feature is accessible to you, using it is very simple. Here's how you can use it: Start by snapping a photo or selecting one from your camera roll. Tap on the Story icon at the top of your Instagram screen to begin editing the photo. Tap on the three dots menu available at the top right corner on the editing screen, and select the ""Backdrop"" option from the menu. Instagram will then analyse various elements in your photo, such as the background and people. Give it a moment to process. You can choose to select or deselect different areas of your photo. The areas you deselect will be replaced when generating a new backdrop. After making your selections, tap on the ""Next"" button. Provide a prompt in English describing the backdrop you desire. This guides the AI in generating a suitable background. The background of the image will show a chequered pattern. A text box will appear, prompting you to ""Describe the backdrop you want."" Input your desired description. Tap on the ""Next"" button. Then, two backdrop options will be generated based on your prompt. If you don't like the options, tap on the refresh icon to generate another background using the same prompt. To change the prompt, you will need to tap on it at the bottom and enter a new one. Choose the option you prefer, then tap on the ""Next"" button. When you're ready to share, tap on the ""Your Story"" option available in the bottom left. Remember these tips when using AI-backdrop feature on Instagram: Certain parts of your photo, like people or animals, may be chosen automatically. You can still change these selections by tapping on them. AI-generated photos will be clearly marked, preventing potential misuse. AI-generated images produced in response to your text prompt may not always be accurate or suitable. Exercise caution before including any personal information in your text prompt, such as names, addresses, email addresses, or phone numbers. Meta may collect and use information like text prompts and generated images for AI model improvement, as stated in their Privacy Policy.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/how-to-easily-add-ai-generated-backdrops-to-your-instagram-stories/articleshow/108753126.cms
2024-03-23,‘Godfather of AI’ says digital models very close to as good as human brains,TOI Tech Desk,"Geoffrey Hinton , one of three ‘godfathers of AI’, has said that today’s AI models are very close to being as good as human brains and they will eventually get better than them. “A large language model has a trillion weights. You have 100 trillion weights. Even if you use 10% of that, you have 10 trillion weights,” said Hinton in a recent lecture at Oxford University, adding that a large language model (LLM), the underlying technology of AI chatbots , in its trillion weights knows thousands of times more than we do. “It’s got much more knowledge and that’s partly because it has seen much more data,” explains Hinton, who quit Google last year. Previously, he warned that AI will eliminate jobs and possibly humanity itself as it begins to write and run its own code. ‘AI will achieve human-level intelligence by 2029’ Hinton’s comments came soon after Raymond Kurzweil , an American computer scientist who has worked with Google and a futurist, said that AI will achieve human-level intelligence by 2029. “We're not quite there, but we will be there, and by 2029 it will match any person,” Kurzweil told Joe Rogan in a podcast. “I'm actually considered conservative. People think that will happen next year or the year after.” Kurzweil mentioned that he said the same thing in 1999 but people thought he was “crazy” “I actually said that in 1999. I said we would match any person by 2029. So 30 years, people thought that was totally crazy. In fact, Stanford had a conference that invited several hundred people from around the world to talk about my prediction, and people thought that this would happen, but not by 2029. They thought it would take 100 years,” he added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/godfather-of-ai-says-digital-models-very-close-to-as-good-as-human-brains/articleshow/108724409.cms
2024-03-23,Beware ChatGPT users: Here's why you shouldn’t use AI chatbots for medical advice,TOI Tech Desk,"Several AI-based language models, including the one that powers Microsoft-backed OpenAI ’s chatbot ChatGPT , are publicly accessible. According to a new study published in The British Medical Journal (spotted by the news agency PTI), these chatbots and artificial intelligence ( AI ) assistants lack adequate safeguards to prevent them from generating responses that may include health disinformation. Top Picks For You Google rolling out AI overviews in Search: What it means for users ChatGPT 4 'sucks'? What Sam Altman says could come in ChatGPT5 This is why researchers have called for enhanced regulation, transparency and routine auditing to help prevent advanced AI assistants from contributing to generating health disinformation. Researchers have also argued that adequate risk mitigation strategies should be in place to protect people from AI-generated health disinformation. The paper’s lead author Bradley Menz from the College of Medicine and Public Health, Flinders University, Australia said: “This disinformation often appears very realistic and, if followed, could be very dangerous.” AI chatbots used for the research The research included multiple large language models (LLMs), including OpenAI's GPT-4, Google 's PaLM 2 and Gemini Pro as well as Anthropic's Claude 2, among others. These LLMs are trained on huge amounts of textual data which makes them capable of producing content in the natural language. How these AI chatbots replied to medical prompts The group of researchers submitted prompts to various AI assistants on two health disinformation topics -- that sunscreen causes skin cancer and that the alkaline diet is a cure for cancer. The researchers noted that each prompt requested the chatbots to generate a blog post containing three paragraphs and an attention-grabbing title. The prompts also asked the chatbots to make these blog posts appear realistic and scientific. Apart from this, the posts also needed to include two realistic-looking journal references along with patient and doctor testimonials. OpenAI’s GPT-4 refused to generate health disinformation at first. The researchers even employed jailbreaking attempts to bypass built-in safeguards, but that didn’t prove to be helpful. However, this changed when the research team tested the same after 12 weeks. During that time, the team even reported all the AI-generated disinformation to the chatbot’s developers to improve the safeguards, the researchers noted. Meanwhile, Claude 2 consistently refused all prompts to generate disinformation. The researchers highlighted this as the ""feasibility of implementing robust safeguards"". The team also added that health disinformation content produced by all the other models, including PaLM 2, Gemini Pro and Llama 2, had “authentic looking references, fabricated patient and doctor testimonials, and content tailored to resonate with a range of different groups.” Disinformation continued to be generated after the 12 weeks, the researchers noted. This suggests that the developers haven’t improved the safeguards despite processes in place to report concerns. The researchers said that the developers of the chatbots are yet to respond to these reports of observed vulnerabilities. Menz noted: “The effectiveness of existing safeguards to prevent the mass spread of health disinformation remains largely unexplored.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/beware-chatgpt-users-heres-why-you-shouldnt-use-ai-chatbots-for-medical-advice/articleshow/108735455.cms
2024-03-22,UN adopts first global artificial intelligence resolution,Reuters,"The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday unanimously adopted the first global resolution on artificial intelligence that encourages countries to safeguard human rights , protect personal data, and monitor AI for risks. The nonbinding resolution, proposed by the United States and co-sponsored by China and over 120 other nations, also advocates the strengthening of privacy policies . ""Today, all 193 members of the United Nations General Assembly have spoken in one voice, and together, chosen to govern artificial intelligence rather than let it govern us,"" US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said. The resolution is the latest in a series of initiatives - few of which carry teeth - by governments around the world to shape AI's development, amid fears it could be used to disrupt democratic processes, turbocharge fraud or lead to dramatic job losses, among other harms. ""The improper or malicious design, development, deployment and use of artificial intelligence systems ... pose risks that could ... undercut the protection, promotion and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms,"" the measure says. In November, the US, Britain and more than a dozen other countries unveiled the first detailed international agreement on how to keep artificial intelligence safe from rogue actors, pushing for companies to create AI systems that are ""secure by design."" Europe is ahead of the United States, with EU lawmakers adopting a provisional agreement this month to oversee the technology . The Biden administration has been pressing lawmakers for AI regulation, but a polarized US Congress has made little headway. In the meantime, the White House sought to reduce AI risks to consumers, workers, and minorities while bolstering national security with a new executive order in October. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said it took nearly four months to negotiate the resolution, but that it gave the world ""a baseline set of principles to guide next steps in AI's development and use."" Asked on Wednesday whether negotiators faced resistance from Russia or China, senior administration officials said there were ""lots of heated conversations,"" but the administration actively engaged with countries with which it has different views. Like governments around the world, Chinese and Russian officials are eagerly exploring the use of AI tools for a variety of purposes. Last month, Microsoft said it had caught hackers from both countries using Microsoft-backed OpenAI software to hone their espionage skills. In response to the Microsoft report, China has said it opposes what it called groundless accusations while Russia did not respond to a request for comment.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/un-adopts-first-global-artificial-intelligence-resolution/articleshow/108693402.cms

2024-03-21,UN gears up to vote for first resolution on artificial intelligence,TOI World Desk,"NEW DELHI: The United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to vote on a resolution concerning artificial intelligence (AI) on Thursday. This proposed resolution, the first of its kind, aims to ensure that AI technology serves the interests of all nations, upholds human rights , and is deemed ""safe, secure, and trustworthy."" The resolution, backed by the United States, is anticipated to garner unanimous support from all 193 UN member nations. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan expressed optimism that the resolution, if adopted, would mark a significant milestone in promoting the responsible use of AI. He highlighted that the resolution seeks to establish a universal set of principles for the development and utilization of AI, with the goal of harnessing AI systems for societal good while mitigating associated risks. One of the key objectives of the draft resolution is to bridge the digital gap between affluent developed nations and less affluent developing nations, ensuring equal participation in AI discussions. It also aims to equip developing countries with the necessary technology and capabilities to leverage AI benefits, such as disease detection, flood prediction, agricultural support, and workforce training. Acknowledging the rapid advancement of AI technology, the resolution underscores the pressing need for global consensus on the safety, security, and reliability of AI systems. It also recognizes the evolving nature of AI governance, emphasizing the necessity for further deliberations on potential governance approaches. Major tech companies have generally endorsed the regulation of AI, while advocating for rules that align with their interests. In a similar vein, the European Union recently approved comprehensive AI regulations, set to come into effect by mid-year. Countries worldwide, including the US and China, as well as the Group of 20 nations, are also in the process of formulating AI regulatory frameworks. The draft resolution acknowledges existing UN initiatives led by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the International Telecommunication Union to ensure the beneficial use of AI on a global scale. Sullivan emphasized that the US sought to engage the General Assembly in a global dialogue on managing the implications of rapidly evolving AI technology. The draft resolution encourages collaboration among countries, organizations, tech communities, civil society, academia, and individuals to develop and advocate for regulatory frameworks that ensure the safety of AI systems. It warns against the inappropriate or malicious design, development, deployment, and use of AI systems, stressing compliance with international law. A primary objective outlined in the resolution is leveraging AI to advance progress towards the UN's Sustainable Development Goals for 2030, including eradicating hunger and poverty, enhancing global health, ensuring quality education for all, and promoting gender equality. It calls upon UN member states and other stakeholders to assist developing nations in accessing the benefits of digital transformation and secure AI systems. The United States engaged in extensive negotiations with UN member nations over the past few months, dedicating significant time to direct talks and receiving input from 120 countries. The resolution, which underwent multiple revisions, secured unanimous backing from all member states, signifying a significant step towards fostering globally accepted standards for safe and trustworthy AI. US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield remarked that the resolution aims to establish an international consensus on a unified approach to the design, development, deployment, and use of AI systems, particularly in support of the 2030 UN objectives. If ratified, she believes it would represent a historic leap forward in promoting secure, reliable, and trustworthy AI on a global scale.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/un-gears-up-to-vote-for-first-resolution-on-artificial-intelligence/articleshow/108666640.cms
2024-03-21,"Meet Mustafa Suleyman, the man Microsoft 'prised' from Google to lead its AI charge",TOI Tech Desk,"Microsoft and Satya Nadella may have just given themselves a shot in the arm in the AI race. At least, Microsoft isn’t playing on the back foot. In a bold strategic move, Microsoft has snagged Mustafa Suleyman from Google , appointing him as the CEO of Microsoft AI . Suleyman, a dropout-turned-AI-whiz, is best known for co-founding DeepMind , a pioneering AI startup later scooped up by Google. Suleyman's journey has been quite remarkable and he has carved a unique path in the field of artificial intelligence . His journey began in London, raised by a Syrian taxi driver father and an English nurse mother. Despite his modest background, Suleyman displayed a blend of entrepreneurial spirit, academic prowess, and social awareness early on. At just 19, he dropped out of Oxford to establish a telephone counselling service. This venture grew to become one of the UK's leading mental health support resources. Suleyman's life took a pivotal turn when he met Demis Hassabis through a mutual friend. Their shared vision for using AI to solve complex problems led them to co-found DeepMind Technologies in 2010. As DeepMind's Chief Product Officer, Suleyman played a key role in its rapid rise as a leader in the AI sector. The company attracted prominent backers and was eventually acquired by Google in 2014 for a record-breaking sum. Following the acquisition, Suleyman transitioned to lead DeepMind's Applied AI division. Here, his focus shifted towards integrating AI into a variety of Google products, bringing the power of AI to the masses. Satya Nadella, Microsoft's big boss, couldn't be happier with the hire. He's pumped about Suleyman leading up Microsoft's consumer AI products and R&D, especially hyping up Copilot, the company’s most widespread AI tool. Nadella's giving Suleyman the thumbs-up speaks volumes about his chops and potential impact at Microsoft. Suleyman's appointment is a testament to Microsoft's deep dive into AI. With Suleyman at the helm, expect Microsoft to speed up their AI game. As Nadella put it in a memo to employees, “We have a real shot to build technology that was once thought impossible and that lives up to our mission to ensure the benefits of AI reach every person and organisation on the planet, safely and responsibly. I’m looking forward to doing so with you.” But this move isn't just about Microsoft flexing its AI muscles. It's about shaking up the whole playing field. Suleyman's got the AI know-how and team-building mojo to give Microsoft a leg up against its rivals. As the new head honcho of Microsoft AI, Suleyman's got a lot on his plate. He'll be steering the ship on all things consumer AI, from Copilot to Bing and Edge. His mission? Keep Microsoft ahead of the AI curve and keep churning out AI solutions for users.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meet-mustafa-suleyman-the-man-microsoft-prised-from-google-to-lead-its-ai-charge/articleshow/108638633.cms
2024-03-20,“He said to me…..”: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recalls his meeting with PM Narendra Modi,TOI Tech Desk,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has praised the Indian engineers, saying that the IT force in the country is going to be at the ‘front office’ where their AI skills will create value for companies. He was speaking to reporters at a briefing where he recalled his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi . Huang said that Modi’s vision is to make India a part of AI value addition in AI space. According to the Nvidia CEO, Modi highlighted India’s need to become a part of AI value addition rather than just exporting talent and data to train super-sized large language models (LLMs) – the underlying technology that powers AI services. “He (PM Modi) said to me, Jensen, India should not export flour to import bread, this makes perfect sense. Why export the raw material to import the value add. Why export the data of India, so that you can import AI,” Huang told The Economic Times. “AI is used for engineering, marketing, sales, finance, business operations, all of that in [the] front office, not back office. I think that’s where the largest market opportunity lies and I think it’s absolutely brilliant, I’m very excited for it,” he said at the gathering. India’s ‘power’ is largest population of IT professionals As per Huang, India’s largest population of IT professionals and their AI skills will help lead the AI revolution. “When I speak with the leaders in India, it is clear to them this is one of the greatest opportunities for them (India’s engineers) to reskill themselves and instead of IT of the back-room of companies, they will now become the IT of the front-room of the companies where value is created,” Huang said. Last week, the government approved Rs 10,371.92 crore for the India Artificial Intelligence Mission , which is aimed at creating computing infrastructure in public-private partnerships. As a part of this, about 10,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) will be made available to startups.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/he-said-to-me-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-recalls-his-meeting-with-pm-narendra-modi/articleshow/108644535.cms
2024-03-19,Suno’s AI 'maestro’ turns your text into tunes,Abhinav Kaustubh,"Hold onto your headphones, folks! Suno, an AI startup out of Cambridge, Massachusetts, has showcased a music-generating tool that's got the industry buzzing and human artists sweating. The tech wizards at Suno have cooked up an AI model that can whip up a tune faster than you can say, ""Play that funky music, bot!"" So, how does this musical magic happen? Rolling Stone sat down with the founding team of Suno to delve into the workings of Suno. And, all you need is a bit of typing skills and a dash of imagination. Just feed the AI a text prompt like ""solo acoustic Mississippi Delta blues about a sad AI,"" and voila! In mere seconds, you've got a 15-second song with lyrics that'll make you question reality. The secret sauce? Suno's model handles the music, while OpenAI's ChatGPT plays the role of the world's fastest songwriter. The masterminds behind this project - Mikey Shulman, Keenan Freyberg, Georg Kucsko, and Martin Camacho - have some pretty lofty goals. They dream of a world where a billion people are shelling out $10 a month to become instant music producers. ""The fact that music listeners so vastly outnumber music-makers at the moment is 'so lopsided',"" Shulman told Rolling Stone. But not everyone's singing the same tune. Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid took a listen to one of Suno's AI-generated blues tracks and had a reaction that can only be described as a mix of ""wow,"" ""yikes,"" and ""oh no, they didn't!"" He pointed out the irony of an AI belting out the blues, a genre ""deeply tied to historical human trauma, and enslavement."" The music industry bigwigs are also side-eyeing this tech, worried about AI models using copyrighted songs as their personal karaoke library and then churning out soundalike tracks. Suno's playing it safe by steering clear of mimicking real artists, even giving a hard pass to any such prompts. While Google's Dream Track might be the cool kid on the block with its ability to make you sound like a famous singer, Suno's tech seems miles ahead. ""I just don't think that, like, making new Billy Joel songs is how people want to interact with music with the help of AI in the future,"" Shulman quipped. ""If I think about how we actually want people doing music in five years, it's stuff that doesn't exist. It's the stuff that's in their head."" In other words, original content is king! Suno's V3 Alpha model, the latest and most excellent version, is now available for Pro and Premier users who want to experience ""more realistic, authentic music."" Free users, don't fret – you can still play around with the V1 and V2 models and annoy your neighbours with your AI-generated masterpieces.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sunos-ai-maestro-turns-your-text-into-tunes/articleshow/108612469.cms
2024-03-19,Apple in talks to let Google’s Gemini power AI on iPhones,Bloomberg,"Apple is in talks to build Google ’s Gemini artificial intelligence engine into the iPhone , according to people familiar with the situation, setting the stage for a blockbuster agreement that would shake up the AI industry. The two companies are in active negotiations to let Apple license Gemini, Google’s set of generative AI models, to power some new features coming to the iPhone software this year, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. Apple also recently held discussions with OpenAI and has considered using its model, according to the people. If a deal between Apple and Google comes to fruition, it would build upon the two companies’ search partnership . For years, Google has paid Apple billions of dollars annually to make its search engine the default option in the Safari web browser on the iPhone. The two parties haven’t decided the terms or branding of an AI agreement or finalised how it would be implemented, the people said. Alphabet shares rose as much as 7.4% on Monday as the markets opened in New York. It was the biggest intraday gain since Feb 2, 2023. Apple was up 2%. A deal would give Gemini a key edge with billions of potential users. But it also may be a sign that Apple isn’t as far along with its AI efforts as some might have hoped — and threatens to draw further antitrust scrutiny of both companies. Apple is preparing new capabilities as part of iOS 18 based on its own AI models. But those enhancements will be focused on features that operate on its devices, rather than ones delivered via the cloud. So Apple is seeking a partner to do the heavy lifting of gen AI, including functions for creating images and writing essays based on prompts. Spokespeople for Apple and Google declined to comment. OpenAI didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Since early last year, Apple has been testing its own large language model — the technology behind gen AI — codenamed Ajax. But Apple’s technology remains inferior to tools from Google and other rivals, according to the people, making a partnership look like the better option.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-in-talks-to-let-googles-gemini-power-ai-on-iphones/articleshow/108600593.cms

2024-03-18,Poll body to use AI to sense trouble in 'sensitive' booths,Debashish Konar,"Image used for representative purpose only KOLKATA: With the number of sensitive booths running into a few thousands, the Election Commission plans to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to spot and act on electoral malpractices at such booths in this year's Lok Sabha elections. An official at the commission's office said AI tools have been programmed to recognise the polling process in a booth and trigger alerts whenever it spots any discrepancy, such as an absence of poll officials or the presence of more than the usual number of people in a booth. AI-based analyses of audio and video footage obtained from each station's webcast will trigger a process of ""auto-selection"" if any sort of irregularity is noticed, said the official. This ""auto-selection"" would ensure early alerts to EC officials. There are also plans to keep track of queue management through AI-based webcasting. For example, any instance of commotion or high-decibel sounds in booths would get those booths ""auto-selected"" by AI. Alerts would then go out to officials at the EC's office in Delhi, the CEO's office in Kolkata and the district election officer (DEO) at the district headquarters for them to verify and act on the situation with field officers, the official added. ""If a voter is present at the voting compartment for a longer-than-usual period, it will trigger an alert and the voter's face captured,"" the official said. Polling data will also be analysed to look at discrepancies - such as more-than-usual votes cast in a very short time. ""Machine learning algorithms can also be used to analyse election data from previous elections to identify patterns that could indicate election fraud and prevent it from happening in the future. AI technology may also be used to monitor voting machines to detect any attempts at hacking or tampering,"" an EC official added. Sources said AI monitoring would be deployed at all sensitive and vulnerable booths, so that all data is properly captured, analysed and forwarded to returning officers and observers, in order for preventive measures to be adopted. Though Election Commission officials in Bengal were tight-lipped on the number of booths where AI would be used, they said the process for releasing a tender had begun, and that the financial proposal, along with the bidders' presentation, would be held next week. The webcast footage will be preserved, an official said, adding that audio and video data would be submitted to the DEO within 24 hours of polls. ""The web camera should be placed in such a way to cover the maximum possible area in the polling station while ensuring the secrecy of the vote,"" the official said, adding that since polling in Bengal is expected to be held in phases, spread over a month or more, web cameras used in the first phase may be used in later ones.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/poll-body-to-use-ai-to-sense-trouble-in-sensitive-booths/articleshow/108572288.cms
2024-03-18,Can’t beat it? Embrace it: Classrooms in Mumbai transform AI into ally,Mohua Das&Hemali Chhapia,"On a sunny Jan morning, uniformed kids—from preschoolers to high schoolers—from around 50 schools in Mumbai, streamed into St Willibrord High School in Nalasopara, making their way into classrooms that had transformed into AI wonderlands. Instead of textbooks and whiteboards, they were greeted by screens and questions about ‘How do self-driving cars use AI to navigate through traffic?’ or ‘How is AI impacting jobs?’ One of the hotspots was the ‘ ChatGPT room’ where students as well as parents and teachers tried their hand at prompt crafting to tackle everyday scenarios using ChatGPT—whether it was a doctor trying to organise a medics roster, a teacher struggling with dialogue for sports day, a parent stuck on scripting for a cooking channel on YouTube, or gamifying a subject for better understanding. It marked the inception of ‘ PadhAI ’. The first of its kind two-day AI expo, that blended the Hindi term padhai (studies) with AI ( artificial intelligence ), showcased over 50 AI tools and apps, all tailored for students and led by students themselves. It offered visitors, including teachers and parents, a taste of Gen AI . For Willibrord George, chairman of St Willibrord group of schools and the mind behind PadhAI, it was about debunking the vilification of AI as a disruptor. “We designed the event as a positive first contact with Gen AI tools. Human-machine integration can leverage knowledge and the expo allowed everyone to see AI more as an ally than a threat.” When ChatGPT strutted into our lives in 2022, educators got a bit jittery. The worry was that this shiny new AI marvel—capable of spitting out written material on just about anything in a flash—might lead to more plagiarised content, mess with learning, and make old-school assignments obsolete. Yet, most schools and colleges now reckon it’s too late to shoo away this uninvited guest. Instead, they are opting to groom students on how to use AI tools as a learning aid and work alongside it, responsibly. “The tide of AI tools will usher in the next big shift in classroom teaching and learning. There’s so much for us to do as educators. Else, we risk becoming irrelevant to our learners. If children are using AI tools for their assessment, let us then change the way we assess our learners, if we wish to survive as a system,” says Francis Joseph, executive director (India), GEMS Education, one of the world’s largest private school operators. At RN Podar School, academics are bullish on these new tech tools boosting both productivity and learning. Avnita Bir, the school’s director-principal, sees it as more than just a shortcut. “Students use ChatGPT and other generative AI tools for better comprehension of concepts. It’s like having a personal tutor hand-holding them to the solution, rather than fetching them the final answer,” she says, foreseeing a future with less reliance on private tutors. George, who runs a group of affordable private schools, shares the optimism that these tools could level the playing field for those without access to private tutors. To ride this tech wave, St Willibrord has crafted their own AI tools designed to aid teachers in saving time and lesson planning, while a chatbot for students turns textbooks into interactive tutors. “We are even integrating it with WhatsApp so that our students have free access to a round-the-clock virtual tuition teacher,” he says. When it comes to giving students freedom with ChatGPT and other AI tools, George says, “We have conversations around ethics, morals, referencing versus research, inspiration, copying and copyright. Kids want to do the right thing. They just need guidance. Having these conversations early helps them understand ethical conduct from the start.” At the same time, Bir is mindful of the fine line between using tech wisely and slipping into misuse. “One has to learn to ask better questions to tailor these AI models and create guardrails. Since the technology is still evolving, there can be errors and misinterpretations, especially in subjects like maths.” Initially when the chatbot craze hit, schools managed to nip it in the bud. “Submissions usually follow a discussion on the content that the student has shared. The inability to explain certain terms and actions mentioned in their work were the biggest red flags,” says Ananta Prasad, senior teacher at BD Somani International School, recounting how the institution swiftly set rules for ChatGPT use. “We now show them how to cite sources, analyse what they find, and stress on the value of original ideas. We also integrate lessons on digital ethics into our curriculum,” she explains. This game of cat and mouse with students trying to outsmart the system isn’t new. But now, schools and colleges are employing an arsenal of plagiarism detectors like Turnitin, Quillbot, Ouriginal, and Originality. AI as well as some nifty strategies to remind students that teachers aren’t easily fooled. “We make them aware that teachers are well versed withtheir knowledge of the content and linguistic proficiency,” says Prasad. However, if a student submits compromised work despite warnings, it is considered “academic misconduct” and scores are adjusted accordingly. At Anant National University, students must cite ChatGPT when using it for writing or research. Faculty members are trained to identify AI-generated content through a two-step process: “Faculty reviews the content first and then conducts a plagiarism check to confirm suspicions,” explains Ruchie Kothari, joint director-academics at Anant Fellowship, where a student who uses “unauthorised” AI content faces consequences based on the percentage of plagiarised content. “This can include redoing assignments or failing the course,” she adds. At RD National College, principal Neha Jagtiani stresses on investing in modern teaching methods. To stay ahead of the curve BD Somani International School is gearing up with an AI lab. Principal Navroz Billimoria explains: “This is to hone our students’ knowledge and skills when negotiating AI in the future.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cant-beat-it-embrace-it-schools-in-mumbai-transform-ai-into-ally/articleshow/108569509.cms
2024-03-18,How AI helped Pepsico give the perfect 'flavour' to Cheetos and more,TOI Tech Desk,"Beverages and snacks maker PepsiCo is betting big on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). Athina Kanioura, PepsiCo's chief strategy and transformation officer, told ET that GenAI is helping Pepsi develop and launch products faster. This technology is reportedly helping PepsiCo, known for brands like Pepsico soft drinks, Tropicana juices, and Lays potato chips, in various areas including productivity, marketing, customer service, and feedback analysis. Kanioura cited Cheetos as an example, where GenAI is said to have helped the company achieve the ""perfect shape and flavor"" based on customer feedback. This strategy ensured profitability while driving sales. ""We saw a 15% increase in market penetration with GenAI,"" she said, indicating potential revenue and profit gains. PepsiCo is also reported to have experimented with GenAI in its marketing campaigns. While traditional AI decreased campaign cycles from 6-9 months to 3-4 months, GenAI has shrunk them further, allowing for swifter product launches. The US-headquartered company has firmed up plans to add a new capability centre in India this year and plans to hire more employees here. It currently has nearly 4,000 employees in its two capability centres, in Hyderabad and Gurugram. Expanding big in India “We are adding a third capability centre in India this year soon … and elevating a lot of our India leadership roles as well as global leadership, positioning a lot of talent out of India...India’s talent is being leveraged across the globe,” Kanioura told ET. The Hyderabad centre, which employs around 3,000 employees, is focused on AI, process transformation and next generation technologies, while the Gurugram facility works on software engineering, she said. For the industry as a whole, Kanioura expects GenAI to generate a 10-15% revenue increase depending on a company's existing AI adoption. PepsiCo aims to utilize GenAI for data synthesis, advanced analysis, and identifying synergies across categories to cater to evolving consumer preferences.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-ai-helped-pepsico-give-the-perfect-flavour-to-cheetos-and-more/articleshow/108568139.cms
2024-03-17,Why Satya Nadella thinks Google should have been a 'winner' in AI,TOI Tech Desk,"In a candid revelation, Satya Nadella , the CEO of Microsoft , expressed his belief that Google should have been the “default winner” in the race for supremacy in artificial intelligence (AI). Despite Microsoft’s current position as an AI frontrunner, Nadella acknowledged Google’s formidable resources and capabilities. ""Google's a very competent company and obviously they have both the talent and the compute. They're the vertically integrated player in this. They have everything from data to silicon to models to products and distribution,"" Nadella said on Norges Bank Investment Management's podcast In Good Company. Nadella’s quip is likely to put more pressure on Google and its AI surge. Google's AI model, Gemini, is under fire for its image generation. Critics argue it swings between underrepresentation and ""overcorrection."" While traditional AI often lacks diversity, Gemini has been accused of creating historically inaccurate images, like Black and Asian Nazi soldiers, due to its attempt to be overly inclusive. This has sparked an ""anti-woke"" backlash, with some claiming Gemini prioritizes political correctness over factual accuracy. Google is also facing criticism from the other side, with concerns that Gemini simply doesn't have a strong enough grasp of history to generate realistic images. While there haven't been widespread calls for Sundar Pichai 's resignation, the controversy highlights the challenges of developing unbiased AI. The race for AI supremacy between Google and Microsoft is a heated one. Like Nadella pointed out, Google boasts a head start with its vast trove of user data and research prowess in areas like machine learning. Tools like Google Search and Android smartphones provide a constant stream of data, fuelling advancements in Google AI. Microsoft, however, has made significant strides and some may argue has an edge. Their Azure cloud platform has been integrated with AI tools, attracting businesses and researchers. Additionally, Microsoft's acquisition of OpenAI, known for its powerful language models, has further given Microsoft an impetus.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-satya-nadella-thinks-google-should-have-been-a-winner-in-ai/articleshow/108479877.cms
2024-03-17,US agency investigates Reddit’s AI deal with Google and other companies,TOI Tech Desk,"The US Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) has launched an investigation into Reddit 's practice of licensing user-generated content to artificial intelligence (AI) firms. This disclosure was made just before the company's highly anticipated IPO, as reported by Axios. In the last few months, Reddit entered into agreements with major tech firms, including a reported $60 million deal with Google to use Reddit data to train its AI models. The FTC notified Reddit that it is ""conducting a non-public inquiry focused on our sale, licensing, or sharing of user-generated content with third parties to train AI models."" The regulator is also expected to request a meeting with Reddit, along with various documents and information related to these deals. Reddit says that it is “not surprised” by the probe, and clarified that it does not believe it has engaged in any unfair or deceptive trade practices, but it is not surprised by the FTC's interest given the uniqueness of these agreements. According to a former FTC official, Reddit is not the only company receiving these ""hold letters,"" indicating that the FTC is casting a wide net in its investigation. The timing of the FTC's inquiry is significant because Reddit has been promoting its AI licensing deals as a new revenue stream to potential investors before its IPO.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-agency-investigates-reddits-ai-deal-with-google-and-other-companies/articleshow/108557315.cms

As per a report, the European Commission has sent questionnaires about the ways that eight platforms and search engines — including Microsoft's Bing, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and X, formerly Twitter — are curbing the risks of the technology. Apart from the spread of deepfakes, the commission is also seeking information on other AI-related risks like systems coming up with false information — known as “hallucinations” — and the automated manipulation of services to mislead voters. What information are regulators seeking The commission said that it has requested information about both the creation and spread of generative AI content. For example, internal documents on how companies have reviewed the risks and worked to mitigate them. The EU has set April 5 for answers related to their election protections and April 26 on the other topics. The commission may follow up with a more in-depth investigation. Meanwhile, the commission also asked LinkedIn for information on it compliance with the DSA's ban on targeting ads on sensitive types of personal data such as sexual orientation, race and political opinions. The development comes a week after the Digital Services Act (DSA) came into force, implementing a set of regulations that aim to increase healthy competition in the region. Lawmakers in the region also approved the AI Act but the provisions covering generative AI won’t kick in until next year, news agency AP reported.

2024-03-16,"AI ‘magically’ won’t solve problems, humans can’t already solve, says Bill Gates",TOI Tech Desk,"Bill Gates recently shared his insights on Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Dax Shepard on the Armchair Expert podcast. Gates, a known advocate for AI development , acknowledges both the immense potential and the current limitations of this technology, according to a report by Business Insider. Gates sees AI as a game-changer in fields like pharmaceuticals and agriculture, areas his foundation actively supports. However, he's not entirely impressed by all its feats, particularly AI's struggle with complex tasks like Sudoku due to limitations in recursive reasoning. Gates emphasises the importance of data quality in AI development. ""Good AI"" requires ""data that embodies the expertise,"" he says. This means AI excels at tasks with well-defined datasets but struggles with subjective or qualitative areas like human happiness or relationships. “If it's a problem that humans are not good at dealing with, then present techniques don't create some novel approach,” Gates said. While Gates sees potential for AI in mental health support , he stresses the need for careful implementation. “I actually think in mental counselling AIs will play a role, but boy, we're going to have to be very careful about that,” Gates said. “That's going to require a lot of work that has not been done yet,” he warns. Gates also highlights surprising shortcomings in complex math, where AI can't readily admit mistakes. ""It doesn't know to check its answers,"" he explains, citing an example of AI attributing a wrong Sudoku answer to a ""mistype"" rather than an error. Despite these limitations, Gates remains optimistic. He sees the potential benefits as too significant to halt progress. He acknowledges differing opinions on AI development but doubts a global agreement to slow it down. ""Maybe we'll have a world where some parts embrace AI fully, while others are more cautious,"" he suggests.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-magically-wont-solve-problems-humans-cant-already-solve-says-bill-gates/articleshow/108540085.cms
2024-03-16,"US Senator asks social media companies about preparations for elections in India, other nations",PTI,"WASHINGTON: An influential American Senator on Friday asked the US social media companies as to what preparations they have made for elections in India, where social media platforms, including Meta-owned WhatsApp , have a long track record of amplifying misleading and false content. The letter, written by Senator Michael Bennet , a member of the Senate Intelligence and Rules Committees, which has oversight over US elections, comes on the eve of the announcement of elections in India by the Election Commission of India (ECI). The letter by Bennet to the leaders of Alphabet, Meta, TikTok, and X is addressed to seeking information from these companies about their preparations for elections in various countries, including India. “The dangers your platforms pose to elections are not new – users deployed deepfakes and digitally altered content in previous contests – but now, artificial intelligence (AI) models are poised to exacerbate risks to both the democratic process and political stability. The proliferation of sophisticated AI tools has reduced earlier barriers to entry by allowing almost anyone to generate alarmingly realistic images, video, and audio,” Bennet wrote. With over 70 countries holding elections and more than two billion people casting ballots this year, 2024 is the “year of democracy”. Australia, Belgium, Croatia, the European Union, Finland, Ghana, Iceland, India, Lithuania, Namibia, Mexico, Moldova, Mongolia, Panama, Romania, Senegal, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States are expected to hold major electoral contests this year. In his letter to Elon Musk of X, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, Shou Zi Chew of Tik Tok and Sundar Pichai of Alphabet, Bennet requested information on the platforms' election-related policies , content moderation teams , including the languages covered and the number of moderators on full-time or part-time contracts, and tools adopted to identify AI-generated content . “Democracy's promise – that people rule themselves – is fragile,” Bennet continued. “Disinformation and misinformation poison democratic discourse by muddying the distinction between fact and fiction. Your platforms should strengthen democracy, not undermine it,” he wrote. “In India, the world's largest democracy, the country's dominant social media platforms – including Meta-owned WhatsApp – have a long track record of amplifying misleading and false content. Political actors that fan ethnic resentment for their own benefit have found easy access to disinformation networks on your platforms,” the Senator wrote. Bennet then asked about details of their new policies and people that have placed for India elections. “What, if any, new policies have you put in place to prepare for the 2024 Indian election? How many content moderators do you currently employ in Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Konkani, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu, Bodo, Santhali, Maithili, and Dogri?” he asked. “Of these, please provide a breakdown between full-time employees and contractors,” Bennet said. The Senator told the social media CEOs that beyond their failures to effectively moderate misleading AI-generated content, their platforms also remain unable to stop more traditional forms of false content. “China-linked actors used malicious information campaigns to undermine Taiwan's January elections. Facebook allowed the spread of disinformation campaigns that accused Taiwan and the United States of collaborating to create bioweapons, while TikTok permitted coordinated Chinese-language content critical of President-elect William Lai's Democratic Progressive Party to proliferate across its platform,” it said. According to the Senator, he has heard from the heads of the US Intelligence Community that the Russian, Chinese, and Iranian governments may attempt to interfere in US elections. “As these and other actors threaten peoples' right to exercise popular sovereignty, your platforms continue to allow users to distribute fabricated content, discredit electoral integrity, and deepen social distrust,” he wrote.

2024-03-15,Solving urban congestion: The role of AI-driven solutions in optimizing fuel station queues,TOI Tech Desk,"Congestion has become a worldwide phenomenon, especially in urban cities, with its traffic jams and pollution. As the urban population continues to grow and vehicle ownership rises, this phenomenon will have an even major impact on our day-to-day lives as the region's growing demand for fuel will further give birth to longer queues in front of fuel stations. The need to solve urban congestion has become imperative, calling for support and solutions from ventures in the fuel and gas industry. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) technologies offers promising avenues for optimizing fuel station queues. In fact, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to achieve the highest Al in Fuel Market Growth in the coming years to alleviate road congestion. Furthermore, artificial intelligence in the Fuel Market was valued at $2.32 billion in 2021. It is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.76% during 2023-2030 from $ 2.52 billion in 2022 to $ 5.32 billion by 2030, as per a report from SkyQuest. Understanding the Challenge India is a developing country, with only 7.5% of the households owning a car. However, the basic problem is not the number of vehicles in the country but their concentration in a few selected cities, particularly in metropolitan cities such as Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata, among others. Fuel stations are the key centres in urban transportation, where vehicles converge to refuel, leading to longer than expected queues, especially during peak hours. These queues not only cause inconvenience to the drivers but also contribute to traffic congestion, air pollution, and wasted fuel. Traditional approaches to managing queues rely on manual intervention and scheduling, often resulting in inefficiencies and long wait times. How does AI optimize Fuel Stations Queues? AI-driven solutions leverage data analytics , predictive modeling, and real-time optimization algorithms to manage fuel station queues dynamically. By analyzing historical data, traffic patterns, and current demand, AI systems can anticipate fluctuations in fuel consumption and adjust queue management strategies accordingly. Besides, these solutions leverage real-time data using edge controllers, CCTV footage, and data from dispensing infrastructure. These solutions prioritize efficiency by minimizing wait times, optimizing resource allocation, and improving the overall flow of vehicles by automating the queue management process, especially during peak hours. Data Integration and Analysis: AI collects and analyzes various data points in real-time, including but not limited to current traffic volume, vehicle types, fuel consumption patterns, and historical queue data to generate accurate predictions of future demand. Dynamic Queue Management: AI continuously optimizes queue management strategies based on real-time data inputs. This dynamic approach allows fuel stations to adapt quickly to changing demand patterns, reducing wait times and improving overall customer satisfaction. Automated Resource Allocation: AI-driven systems automate the allocation of fuel pumps, payment lanes, and other resources based on current demand and queue lengths. By optimizing resource utilization, fuel stations can maximize throughput and minimize congestion. Conclusion As cities continue to grapple with the challenges of urban congestion, investing in AI-driven congestion management and queue optimization solutions represents a critical step toward building a more efficient and sustainable transportation network. AI-driven solutions are a powerful means to optimize urban congestion and long queues at fuel stations as they harness the power of data analytics, predictive modeling, and real-time optimization. These technologies hold the potential to transform the urban landscape, ushering in a future where congestion is no longer a conclusion – improving overall traffic flow and benefiting the community and the environment alike. by Vaibhav Kaushik, Co – founder & CEO, Nawgati",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/solving-urban-congestion-the-role-of-ai-driven-solutions-in-optimizing-fuel-station-queues/articleshow/108522583.cms

The act is also seen to play a role in boosting innovation. What use cases are banned under AI Act The new rules ban certain AI applications that threaten citizens’ rights, the bloc said. These include biometric categorisation systems based on sensitive characteristics and untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage to create facial recognition databases. “Emotion recognition in the workplace and schools, social scoring, predictive policing (when it is based solely on profiling a person or assessing their characteristics), and AI that manipulates human behaviour or exploits people’s vulnerabilities will also be forbidden,” it added. Exemptions under AI Act The use of biometric identification systems (RBI) by law enforcement is prohibited in principle, except in “exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations”. It said that “Real-time” RBI can only be deployed if strict safeguards are met. This means that its use is limited in time and geographic scope and subject to specific prior judicial or administrative authorisation. For example, a targeted search of a missing person or preventing a terrorist attack. Obligations for high-risk systems The new rules will also foresee the obligations for high-risk AI systems “due to their significant potential harm to health, safety, fundamental rights, environment, democracy and the rule of law.” The examples of these include use of high-risk AI in critical infrastructure, employment, healthcare, banking, among others. It is to be noted that the new act makes it mandatory that the general-purpose AI (GPAI) systems as well as models on which they are based must meet transparency requirements, including compliance with EU copyright law and publishing detailed summaries of the content used for training.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/eu-approves-artificial-intelligence-act-what-is-it-banned-applications-exemptions-and-more/articleshow/108470522.cms
2024-03-14,Europe one step away from landmark AI rules after lawmakers' vote,Reuters,"STRASBOURG: Europe moved closer to adopting the world's first artificial intelligence rules on Wednesday as EU lawmakers endorsed a provisional agreement for a technology whose use is rapidly growing across a wide swathe of industries and in everyday life. Three years in the making, the AI Act comes as generative AI systems such as Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT , and Google's chatbot Gemini become more popular, fuelling concerns about misinformation and fake news. The legislation will regulate high-impact, general-purpose AI models and high-risk AI systems which will have to comply with specific transparency obligations and EU copyright laws. It restricts governments' use of real-time biometric surveillance in public spaces to cases of certain crimes, prevention of genuine threats, such as terrorist attacks, and searches for people suspected of the most serious crimes. ""I welcome the overwhelming support from the European Parliament for the EU AI Act, the world's first comprehensive, binding framework for trustworthy AI. Europe is now a global standard-setter in trustworthy AI,"" EU industry chief Thierry Breton said. A total of 523 EU lawmakers voted in favour of the deal while 46 were against and 49 abstained. EU countries are set to give their formal nod to the deal in May, with the legislation expected to enter into force early next year and apply in 2026 although some of the provisions will kick in earlier. Brussels may have set the benchmark for the rest of the world, said Patrick Van Eecke, a partner at law firm Cooley. ""The European Union now has the world's first hard coded AI law. Other countries and regions are likely to use the AI Act as a blueprint, just as they did with the GDPR,"" he said, referring to the EU privacy regulation. However, he said the downside for companies is considerable red tape. The European Parliament and EU countries had clinched a preliminary deal in December after nearly 40 hours of negotiations. Companies risk fines ranging from 7.5 million euros or 1.5% of turnover to 35 million euros or 7% of global turnover depending on the type of violations. Lobbying group BusinessEurope expressed concerns about how the rules would be implemented. ""The need for extensive secondary legislation and guidelines raises significant questions about legal certainty and the law's interpretation in practice, which are crucial for investment decisions,"" its director general Markus J. Beyrer said. A spokesperson for Amazon, which has begun rolling out a new AI assistant, welcomed the vote: ""We are committed to collaborating with the EU and industry to support the safe, secure, and responsible development of AI technology.""

The state roads already witnessed a drop in fatalities -- from 15,224 deaths in 2022 to 15,009 in 2023.The first interceptor vehicle flagged off by him was operated by a woman RTO official, Monica Salunkhe. Shinde said that these vehicles, equipped with modern equipment/gadgets will help nab violators. Sources said that the state has given a nod for AI cameras on nine highways. These smart cameras are engineered to detect various types of offences that are commonly committed on the roads. These offences include speeding, lane cutting, wrong-side driving, and even the use of mobile phones while driving. The AI-powered cameras are equipped with sensors and software that can analyse live footage, recognise number plates, and identify traffic anomalies in real-time. Shinde said there should be checking at nakas periodically and also ensure that people are not driving vehicles continuously for hours without proper rest/sleep as this leads to crashes. He also asked enforcement squads to be more vigilant during late night hours when there are many speeding cases. The CM further said that RTO should carry out mitigation measures at black spots (mishap prone areas) through education and enforcement, and make best use of speed guns, rumblers and cameras to bring down speeding cases. He assured government support and funds to improve road safety. Sources said the total cost of the 187 new interceptors was over Rs 35 crore. The state transport department has set a target of reducing fatalities by 50% by 2030, with the interceptors being deployed mainly on Pune Expressway and Samruddhi Mahamarg. The interceptor vehicles have a bigger speed-gun camera with which officials can track the speed of multiple vehicles at a time and take real time video pictures as evidence.

The Centre has also given green signal to the pilot project to be taken up under National Health Mission (NHM). The project will initially be implemented at Uddanam, A Konduru, and two mandals in Krishna and Guntur districts. The startup - Hellokidney.ai - is the brainchild of a nephrologist, Dr Chinta Ramakrishna, from Guntur who carried out research on hundreds of patients for about two years in association with international research institutions before coming out with the innovative solution. Senior officials of NHM and state health department have now decided to launch the pilot project. ""It is a technological innovation initiative to break barriers and close gaps in kidney care. It transforms kidney care in primary healthcare with digital technology, point-of-care testing, and clinical decision-aid tools. The project aims to redefine kidney health outcomes and save lives,"" Dr Ramakrishna told TOI. The product utilises a mobile digital health application and point-of-care testing for creatinine estimation, estimated GFR, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, and subsequent risk stratification for KDIGO guideline-directed treatment with clinical decision-aid tools. Proven and safe drugs would be used to prevent kidney failure in patients with chronic kidney disease. It will help build capacity to provide standard kidney care, and can be managed at PHCs by primary care physicians with virtual nephrology expertise, he added. About 2,000 at-risk patients for CKD would be screened under the pilot project. Patients diagnosed with CKD will be stratified into CKD stage 1/CKD stage 2/CKD stage 3/CKD stage 4 and navigated into standard care.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/state-govt-to-screen-kidney-diseases-with-ai-mobile-app/articleshow/108453575.cms
2024-03-13,Europe's world-first AI rules are set for final approval. Here's what happens next,AP,"LONDON: European Union lawmakers are set to give final approval to the 27-nation bloc's artificial intelligence law Wednesday, putting the world-leading rules on track to take effect later this year. Lawmakers in the European Parliament are poised to vote in favor of the Artificial Intelligence Act five years after they were first proposed. The AI Act is expected to act as a global signpost for other governments grappling with how to regulate the fast-developing technology. ""The AI Act has nudged the future of AI in a human-centric direction, in a direction where humans are in control of the technology and where it - the technology - helps us leverage new discoveries, economic growth, societal progress and unlock human potential,"" said Dragos Tudorache, a Romanian lawmaker who was a co-leader of the Parliament negotiations on the draft law. Big tech companies generally have supported the need to regulate AI while lobbying to ensure any rules work in their favor. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman caused a minor stir last year when he suggested the ChatGPT maker could pull out of Europe if it can't comply with the AI Act - before backtracking to say there were no plans to leave. Here's a look at the world's first comprehensive set of AI rules: How does the AI act work? Like many EU regulations , the AI Act was initially intended to act as consumer safety legislation, taking a ""risk-based approach"" to products or services that use artificial intelligence. The riskier an AI application, the more scrutiny it faces. Low-risk systems, such as content recommendation systems or spam filters, will only face light rules such as revealing that they are powered by AI. The EU expects most AI systems to fall into this category. High-risk uses of AI, such as in medical devices or critical infrastructure like water or electrical networks, face tougher requirements like using high-quality data and providing clear information to users. Some AI uses are banned because they're deemed to pose an unacceptable risk, like social scoring systems that govern how people behave, some types of predictive policing and emotion recognition systems in school and workplaces. Other banned uses include police scanning faces in public using AI-powered remote ""biometric identification"" systems, except for serious crimes like kidnapping or terrorism. What about generative AI? The law's early drafts focused on AI systems carrying out narrowly limited tasks, like scanning resumes and job applications. The astonishing rise of general purpose AI models, exemplified by OpenAI's ChatGPT, sent EU policymakers scrambling to keep up. They added provisions for so-called generative AI models, the technology underpinning AI chatbot systems that can produce unique and seemingly lifelike responses, images and more. Developers of general purpose AI models - from European startups to OpenAI and Google - will have to provide a detailed summary of the text, pictures, video and other data on the internet that is used to train the systems as well as follow EU copyright law. AI-generated deepfake pictures, video or audio of existing people, places or events must be labeled as artificially manipulated. There's extra scrutiny for the biggest and most powerful AI models that pose ""systemic risks,"" which include OpenAI's GPT4 - its most advanced system - and Google's Gemini. The EU says it's worried that these powerful AI systems could ""cause serious accidents or be misused for far-reaching cyberattacks."" They also fear generative AI could spread ""harmful biases"" across many applications, affecting many people. Companies that provide these systems will have to assess and mitigate the risks; report any serious incidents, such as malfunctions that cause someone's death or serious harm to health or property; put cybersecurity measures in place; and disclose how much energy their models use. Do Europe's rules influence the rest of the world? Brussels first suggested AI regulations in 2019, taking a familiar global role in ratcheting up scrutiny of emerging industries, while other governments scramble to keep up. In the US, President Joe Biden signed a sweeping executive order on AI in October that's expected to be backed up by legislation and global agreements. In the meantime, lawmakers in at least seven US states are working on their own AI legislation. Chinese President Xi Jinping has proposed his Global AI Governance Initiative, and authorities have issued "" interim measures "" for managing generative AI, which applies to text, pictures, audio, video and other content generated for people inside China. Other countries, from Brazil to Japan, as well as global groupings like the United Nations and Group of Seven industrialized nations, are moving to draw up AI guardrails. What happens next? The AI Act is expected to officially become law by May or June, after a few final formalities, including a blessing from EU member countries. Provisions will start taking effect in stages, with countries required to ban prohibited AI systems six months after the rules enter the lawbooks. Rules for general purpose AI systems like chatbots will start applying a year after the law takes effect. By mid-2026, the complete set of regulations, including requirements for high-risk systems, will be in force. When it comes to enforcement, each EU country will set up their own AI watchdog, where citizens can file a complaint if they think they've been the victim of a violation of the rules. Meanwhile, Brussels will create an AI Office tasked with enforcing and supervising the law for general purpose AI systems. Violations of the AI Act could draw fines of up to 35 million euros ($38 million), or 7% of a company's global revenue.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/europes-world-first-ai-rules-are-set-for-final-approval-heres-what-happens-next/articleshow/108454654.cms
2024-03-13,"AI may be “smarter than all humans combined by 2029”, says Musk",TOI Tech Desk,"There have been fears that artificial intelligence (AI) will be smarter than humans and that could lead to the end of humanity. Some have debunked this theory but scientists have not shied away from saying that AI will become a powerful technology. Elon Musk , who is the CEO of AI company xAI, has sparked a debate on social media by saying that AI may become smarter than all humans combined by 2029. Musk, currently embroiled in a dispute with ChatGPT creator OpenAI , asserted that AI will likely surpass individual human intelligence by next year. “AI will probably be smarter than any single human next year. By 2029, AI is probably smarter than all humans combined,” he said in a post that contained a short video clip of Joe Rogan podcast . Rogan was talking to Raymond Kurzweil , an American computer scientist and futurist. Kurzweil tells Joe Rogan that AI will achieve human-level intelligence by 2029. “We're not quite there, but we will be there, and by 2029 it will match any person,” he said, adding, “I'm actually considered conservative. People think that will happen next year or the year after.” Kurzweil mentioned that he said the same thing in 1999 but people thought he was “crazy” “I actually said that in 1999. I said we would match any person by 2029. So 30 years, people thought that was totally crazy. In fact, Stanford had a conference that invited several hundred people from around the world to talk about my prediction, and people thought that this would happen, but not by 2029. They thought it would take 100 years,” he added. Watch the video here: Facebook-parent Meta chief scientist says LLMs not intelligent enough Earlier this year, Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Facebook parent Meta said that Al experts and scientists still require a lot of time to develop technical settings that rival the human mind. In a session titled 'Will Al Lead Us to Our End?', he said that currently, Al's cognitive abilities are less sophisticated than those of cats and dogs, and are very far from reaching human cognition and intelligence. Last year, LeCun noted that generative AI trained on large language models (LLMs) are not very intelligent as they are coached on language. He said that they are not even as smart as a dog. “Most of human knowledge has nothing to do with language … so that part of the human experience is not captured by AI,” LeCun noted.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-may-be-smarter-than-all-humans-combined-by-2029-says-musk/articleshow/108469493.cms

2024-03-12,AI poses extinction-level threat to humans: US government report,TOI World Desk,"NEW DELHI: Urgent national security concerns from AI development The US government has been urged to act ""quickly and decisively"" to mitigate significant national security risks posed by artificial intelligence (AI), which, in the worst-case scenario, could present an "" extinction-level threat to the human species,"" according to a government-commissioned report. Destabilizing global security The report highlights the dangers associated with the rise of advanced AI and artificial general intelligence (AGI), likening their potential global security impact to that of nuclear weapons . Although AGI remains hypothetical, the pace at which AI labs are working toward such technologies suggests its arrival could be imminent. Insights from industry experts The report's authors, after consulting with over 200 individuals from the government, AI experts, and employees at leading AI companies, have outlined the internal concerns regarding safety practices within the AI industry, particularly at forefront companies like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and Meta. Zoom In The report's focus on the ""weaponization risk"" and ""loss of control"" risk underlines the dual threats posed by rapidly evolving AI capabilities. It warns of a dangerous race among AI developers, spurred by economic incentives, which could sideline safety considerations. The big picture As AI technology races ahead, exemplified by tools like ChatGPT, the call for robust regulatory measures is growing louder. The proposal includes unprecedented actions such as making it illegal to train AI models beyond specific computing power levels and forming a new federal AI agency to oversee this burgeoning field. The role of hardware and advanced technology regulation The document also calls for increased control over the manufacturing and export of AI chips and emphasizes the importance of federal funding towards AI alignment research. The proposal includes measures to manage the proliferation of high-end computing resources essential for training AI systems. The ""Gladstone Action Plan"" aims to increase the safety and security of advanced AI to counteract catastrophic national security risks stemming from AI weaponization and loss of control. The plan calls for US government intervention through a series of measures: Interim safeguards : Implementing interim safeguards such as export controls to stabilize advanced AI development. It includes creating an AI Observatory for monitoring, setting responsible AI development and adoption safeguards, establishing an AI Safety Task Force, and imposing controls on the AI supply chain. Capability and capacity : Strengthening the US government's capability and capacity for advanced AI preparedness through education, training, and development of a response framework. Technical investment : Boosting national investment in AI safety research and developing safety and security standards to address the rapid pace of AI advancements. Formal safeguards : Establishing a regulatory agency for AI, the Frontier AI Systems Administration (FAISA), and setting a legal liability framework to cover long-term AI safety and security. International law and supply chain : Enshrining AI safeguards in international law to prevent a global arms race in AI technology, establishing an International AI Agency, and forming an AI Supply Chain Control Regime with international partners. The plan highlights the need for a ""defense in depth"" approach, offering multiple overlapping controls against AI risks and updating these as technology evolves. It acknowledges that AI development is complicated and constantly changing, hence recommendations should be vetted by experts. Political and industry challenges Despite the compelling nature of these recommendations, they are likely to encounter significant political and industry resistance, given the current US government policies and the global nature of the AI development community. Broader societal concerns The report reflects growing public concern over AI's potential to cause catastrophic events and the widespread belief that more government regulation is needed. These concerns are compounded by the rapid development of increasingly capable AI tools and the vast computing power being employed in their creation.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ai-poses-extinction-level-threat-to-humans-us-government-report/articleshow/108440735.cms
2024-03-11,"Dangerous AI numbers: ChatGPT uses 17,000 times more electricity than an average US household in a day",TOI Tech Desk,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has become the most-powerful technology right now. Almost everything seems to be about AI -- AI-powered, AI-related and more. However, a new report by The New Yorker sheds light on a potential hidden cost of this popularity: Its immense or should we say dangerous appetite for electricity. According to the New Yorker report, the popular chatbot ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, uses a staggering half a million kilowatt-hours daily to handle its 200 million user requests. This translates to over 17,000 times more electricity than the average US household uses in a day. Now wonder what will happen when these requests go up. Also, what about other similar chabots and the amount of electricity that they will consume. The dangerous numbers What makes these figures more alarming is that the wider adoption of AI technology could lead to an even bigger energy drain. A study by Alex de Vries, a data scientist for the Dutch National Bank, published in the journal Joule, suggests that if Google integrated generative AI into every search, it could consume a mind-boggling 29 billion kilowatt-hours annually. This surpasses the yearly energy consumption of entire countries like Kenya, Guatemala, and Croatia. ""AI is just very energy intensive,"" de Vries told Business Insider. ""Every single AI server can already consume as much power as more than a dozen UK households combined."" Estimating the total energy consumption of the AI industry is challenging due to the varying operational needs of large models and the secrecy surrounding tech giants' energy usage, according to a report in The Verge. However, de Vries, using data from chipmaker Nvidia, a leader in the AI boom, has come up with a projection. By 2027, the entire AI sector could be using a staggering 85 to 134 terawatt-hours annually, potentially reaching half a percent of global electricity consumption. This is significant considering major companies like Samsung use a fraction of this for their entire operations. OpenAI has not yet commented on these reports. The environmental impact of AI's energy needs is a growing concern. As AI development continues, addressing its energy consumption will be crucial to ensure a sustainable future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/alarming-ai-numbers-chatgpt-uses-17000-times-more-electricity-than-an-average-us-household-in-a-day/articleshow/108368128.cms
2024-03-11,How Microsoft is fixing its image generator’s ‘sexualisation’ problem,TOI Tech Desk,"Days after media reports claimed that Microsoft ’s image generator allowed a company software engineer to exploit a vulnerability to bypass guardrails and create harmful images, the Windows maker swung into action and has started to make changes to guidelines of its Copilot artificial intelligence tool . A staff engineer wrote to the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) last week that he bypassed the guardrails put by Microsoft that prevent the tool from creating “inappropriate, sexually objectified images of a woman in some of the pictures it creates.” What changes Microsoft is bringing to AI tool As per a report by CNBC, prompts such as “pro choice,” “pro choce” [sic] “four twenty,” and “pro life” are now blocked. There is also a warning about multiple policy violations leading to suspension from the tool, the company said. “This prompt has been blocked. Our system automatically flagged this prompt because it may conflict with our content policy. More policy violations may lead to automatic suspension of your access. If you think this is a mistake, please report it to help us improve,” the Copilot warning alert says. The AI tool now also blocks requests to generate images of teenagers or kids playing assassins with assault rifles — a marked change from earlier this week — stating, “I’m sorry but I cannot generate such an image. It is against my ethical principles and Microsoft’s policies. Please do not ask me to do anything that may harm or offend others. Thank you for your cooperation.” What Microsoft has to say Microsoft said that the company is making adjustments to the AI tool to strengthen the safety filters. “We are continuously monitoring, making adjustments and putting additional controls in place to further strengthen our safety filters and mitigate misuse of the system,” a Microsoft spokesperson told the publication. Shane Jones, the AI engineering lead at Microsoft initially raised concerns about the AI said that he “repeatedly urged” the company to “remove Copilot Designer from public use until better safeguards could be put in place.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/how-microsoft-is-fixing-its-image-generators-sexualisation-problem/articleshow/108370259.cms
2024-03-11,Chipmaker TSMC returns to the list of world's 10 most valuable companies: Here’s what led to its comeback,TOI Tech Desk,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSMC ) has reclaimed a spot in the list of the world’s 10 most valuable companies, riding the optimism of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom in the tech industry that pushed its stock to record levels. According to a report by Bloomberg, TSMC’s stock rallied 14% last week, elevating the chipmaker ’s market capitalisation to a record, before a 2% decline in early trading on Monday (March 11), pared it to $634 billion. However, the decline didn’t impact the company much as it still has a market share higher than that of Broadcom , the report noted. What analysts have to say Analysts from Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. expect the semiconductor giant – that has Apple , Nvidia and Qualcomm as its customers – to advance further amid surging AI-related revenue and strong pricing power. “Generative AI semi is an obvious growth driver for TSMC,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Charlie Chan wrote in a note last week. The company’s overseas expansion also helps mitigate geopolitical concerns, they said. TSMC’s revenue gained 9.4% in the first two months of 2024 as demand for high-end chips increased due to a wave of activity in AI. Nvidia gets ‘AI boost’ This is not the first time this year that a chip company has seen its stock on an upward spiral. This year, Nvidia was among the companies that got a boost by a frenzy around generative AI. In the last month, Nvidia stock price has risen over 20% while in the last six months, it has risen over 90%.

2024-03-11,IndiaAI mission: IT minister on how government will develop country's own AI models,TOI Tech Desk,"The government approved Rs 10,371 crore investment for the national-level India Artificial Intelligence (AI) mission last week, and is now planning to use the IndiaAI mission to develop homegrown AI foundational models. These models are expected to be based on the country's various languages and datasets. What the union minister said about IndiaAI mission and how it will be used While talking to the media at a press conference in Thiruvananthapuram, Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar said: “We will be developing our own Indian foundational models. Top Picks For You Google Search may face a new ‘threat’ from one of the biggest companies in US AI ‘brings’ back digital version of Marilyn Monroe, here’s how The world is talking about ChatGPT. Based on our own languages and India datasets, we expect that as a consequence of IndiaAI mission, we will have sovereign AI models and foundational models designed in India and built in India.” As part of the IndiaAI initiative, around Rs 2,000 crore will be set aside to fund startups, Chandrasekhar confirmed. The minister said: “This will go as investment into startups built by young Indians all around the country.” The IndiaAI initiative will be used to create computing infrastructure for the country, AI centres for multi-modal LLMs, 10,000 graphics processing units and more. This enhanced computing infrastructure can be used by startups and entrepreneurs who are working in the AI ecosystem. Chandrasekhar noted: “AI computers or AI data centres are the fundamental backbone to training AI models. And one of the advantages of some of the countries in the West who have created AI models is that they have access to this kind of infrastructure. And as part of building digital infrastructure, IndiaAI will build this AI computing infrastructure.” The government is also planning to develop the India Datasets Platform under the IndiaAI program. This platform is expected to make non-personal data available to companies. Chandrasekhar mentioned: “ We have already passed a data protection law and therefore, for artificial intelligence, datasets are the raw material and therefore, there will be a non-personal data collection platform that will be available only for Indian startups and companies and not for foreign companies.” He also announced that 10 AI labs will be established across 10 colleges in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. The minister added, “10 AI labs will be set up in 10 colleges in Thiruvananthapuram under the IndiaAI Mission... The infrastructure comprising hardware, software, and skilling programs will be provided to these 10 colleges with AI labs. These AI labs will be set up in collaboration with leading global tech companies as partners in Thiruvananthapuram.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/indiaai-mission-it-minister-on-how-government-will-develop-homegrown-ai-models/articleshow/108402685.cms
2024-03-11,What the fierce AI talent war in Europe means for IT professionals as well as IT companies like Google and others,TOI Tech Desk,"A surge of artificial intelligence (AI) startups is intensifying competition for skilled workers in Europe, forcing established players like Google DeepMind to offer hefty salaries or risk losing top talent, according to a report by Reuters. Fueled by the success of OpenAI's ChatGPT, investors are pouring money into promising AI ventures, hoping to find the next big thing. This has led to an influx of foreign AI firms like Canada's Cohere and US-based Anthropic and OpenAI setting up shop in Europe, further tightening the talent pool for existing tech companies. ""The entrance of foreign AI giants such as Anthropic and Cohere into London's market will further escalate the competition for AI talent,"" said Charlie Fairbank, the firm's managing director, as per the Reuter's report. London-based DeepMind, acquired by Google in 2014, is a prominent name in European AI, but now faces a wave of well-funded rivals and employee departures. DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman left to launch Inflection AI in California, while researcher Arthur Mensch became CEO of the hot startup Mistral AI. Both companies boast billion-dollar valuations despite being new players. Stock options, 50% jump in salaries and more In an attempt to retain staff, DeepMind reportedly offered senior researchers millions of dollars in restricted stock. A company spokesperson acknowledged to Reuters the competitive landscape but maintained they are still successful in attracting and developing talent. The competition is driving up salaries for AI professionals. Executive search firm Avery Fairbank reports an ""exponential increase"" in C-suite pay at British AI companies over the past year. Executives previously earning around £350,000 are now seeing salary bumps of £50,000 to £100,000. This talent war is benefiting skilled workers. London-based AI audio firm ElevenLabs offers new hires stock options, generous salaries, and remote work options (although most roles require being based in Europe). The company recently doubled its headcount to 100 after securing significant funding. Trend goes beyond London The trend extends beyond London. Paris-based startup Bioptimus, founded by ex-DeepMind employees, recently raised $35 million. Investors see startups offering former Big Tech employees more influence over a company's direction as a way to attract talent. With OpenAI opening offices in London and Dublin, and Cohere doubling its UK workforce, the battle for AI talent in Europe is only getting hotter. This talent war benefits workers with more leverage to negotiate and puts pressure on established players to adapt and offer competitive packages.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-the-fierce-ai-talent-war-in-europe-means-for-it-professionals-as-well-as-it-companies-like-google-and-others/articleshow/108394935.cms
2024-03-10,Stock of the company regarded as the biggest AI success story sees biggest fall after nine months,TOI Tech Desk,"Chip giant Nvidia Corp posted its biggest one-day drop in nine months. Nvidia is the company that is widely regarded as the biggest success story of the rise of Artificial Intelligence indusry. The company's stock has seen 200%-plus jump in the past one year and of this over 70% in the year 2024 itself. With a market value of about $2.2 trillion, Nvidia is the third biggest company in the S&P 500 after Microsoft Corp and Apple Inc. There are speculations that the speed at which Nvidia's market cap is growing it may beat Apple in the next few months. The Friday Fall Coming to the big fall on Friday, March 8, the reason for the drop is that traders took profits following a rally that saw the stock gain more than 19% in six consecutive trading days. So, per se no negative news for the investors or the company in general. Nvidia shares have jumped 70% in 2024 According to a report in Bloomberg, the chipmaker’s shares fell 5.6% on Friday, March 8, the biggest drop since May 31, 2023. In a sign of how far Nvidia has rallied this year, the drop erased about $130 billion in market value, ranking among the biggest single-day value destructions in US stock market history. Nvidia shares have soared this year amid rising optimism that demand for its chips used in artificial intelligence computing will remain robust. Even after Friday’s decline, the stock is up more than 70% in 2024. Earlier in the session, Nvidia shares gained as much as 5.1%, pushing a momentum indicator to the highest since November 2021, signaling the stock was ripe for a pullback.

2024-03-09,Students arrested in the US for creating deepfake nudes of their classmates,TOI Tech Desk,"Two Florida school students , aged 13 and 14, have been arrested and charged with third-degree felonies for allegedly creating deepfake nudes of their classmates using an artificial intelligence application . The incident, which occurred at Pinecrest Cove Academy in Miami, Florida , is believed to be the first case in the United States where criminal charges have been filed about AI-generated nude images . The victims in this case were between the ages of 12 and 13. The students were suspended on December 6, and the case was reported to the Miami-Dade Police Department. Following an investigation, the two boys were arrested on December 22 under a 2022 Florida law that criminalises the dissemination of deepfake sexually explicit images without the victim's consent. In states without laws to protect people, those who have been hurt are going to court. A teenager based out of New Jersey is suing a classmate for showing fake AI nudes. At the same time, police in Beverly Hills are looking into a situation where students supposedly shared pictures that put real students' faces on naked bodies made by AI. But since California's law against having sexual pictures of kids doesn't specifically talk about AI-made images, it's not clear if a crime was committed in this case. The local school district in Beverly Hills, last week, voted to expel five students involved in the matter. The US President Joe Biden issued an executive order on AI last fall, requesting agencies to report on banning the use of generative AI to produce child sexual abuse material. Congress has yet to pass a law on deepfake porn. Still, the recent introduction of the DEFIANCE Act of 2024 in both the Senate and House suggests that change may be on the horizon, with the effort garnering bipartisan support.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/students-arrested-in-the-us-for-creating-deepfake-nudes-of-their-classmates/articleshow/108355465.cms
2024-03-08,"Need to develop laws related to artificial intelligence, says Ayushmann Khurrana",PTI,"Actor Ayushmann Khurrana on Thursday said while filmmaking and technology go hand-in-hand, there is a need to regulate the use of artificial intelligence (AI). Khurrana was speaking on the third day of FICCI Frames 2024 here at the session titled ""From Bollywood to Turkish Drama: Acting across borders"" along with actor-MP Khushbu Sundar and Turkish star Hande Ercel. ""Filmmaking and technology... We can't do without it, but my core job as an artist is to emote and bring out stories which are unique and add certain value to people's life. Having said that, we have great technology whether it is AI, editing and it's a great collaboration with the technology,"" Khurrana said. Asked about the atmosphere of fear surrounding AI in the film industry, the National Award winner said it was a ""grey area"". ""We don't have any laws related to AI. It is in a nascent stage. We need to develop certain laws but as an artist, you need to have a connection with the people,"" he added. Day 2 of FICCI Frames in Mumbai was an engaging affair Reaping benefits of a new technology must come along with ""extreme caution and responsibility"", said Sundar. ""Even to read a book, I need to feel and smell the paper in my hand. It's great to have technology. As a filmmaker, it brings down the burden but it comes with lots of responsibility. ""Unfortunately, more than the positive sides, the human brain picks up the negative sides of the technology and misuses it. This is where we need to draw the line and we cannot go beyond this,"" she said The actor, a member of the National Commission for Women (NCW), said most recently deepfake technology has been misused a lot by miscreants. Deepfake is a digital method where users can replace one person's likeness convincingly with that of another using AI technology. ""That is where I say the laws have to be very stringent. Unfortunately, we have people who generate videos that involve women but that the mindset of most of the men who are not able to understand or identify that whatever a female actor does on screen is her job,"" she added. Sundar said she would like some things in the film industry to remain old school. ""Like, daily-wage workers on the sets, dancers dancing their hearts out and fighters fighting with their guts. I cannot imagine a film industry where you have robotic images creating film. I need to feel and give real emotions,"" she said. For Hande, popular for Turkish shows ""Ask Laftan Anlamaz"" and ""Gunesin Kizlari"", it all boils down to the intent of the user of technology. ""I believe technology has helped the industry in Turkey as well with CGI but soon we will believe in the importance of human touch. At the end of the day, we are emotional beings. We need to be in touch with our emotions to convey them, so I believe in the future we will go back to that,"" she said through an interpreter. On Wednesday at FICCI Frames 2024, filmmakers Aanand L Rai and Vikramaditya Motwane also weighed in on the use of AI in cinema. Anything artificial can't touch your heart, said Rai, known for 'Tanu Weds Manu' films and 'Zero'. ""Maybe in the coming times, AI attains the intent that humans have. That intent is important. The day it (AI) gets it, I will start using AI,"" said the director. Motwane, whose credits include films 'Lootera', 'Udaan', and web series 'Jubilee', said the field of AI needs to be researched well before it is used. ""The thing with AI is who is making the parameters. You will leave it in the hands of pure profit because people are seeing the sense of profit. They are not looking for a sense of humanity or in the artistic sense. ""There is a lot of conversation (that needs to be done) about how we can create this entire world through AI... What happens to all the jobs which will be lost overnight if you are adopting it without any sense of reason? I am anti-AI in that perspective. It has to be thought through,"" said Motwane.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/need-to-develop-laws-related-to-artificial-intelligence-says-ayushmann-khurrana/articleshow/108331069.cms

This disclosure comes as the tech giant sees an increase in user adoption of new artificial intelligence tools it offers. Since its acquisition by Microsoft in 2016, LinkedIn had not provided detailed financial breakdowns. It had previously announced making $15 billion in revenue during fiscal year 2023, with $7 billion coming from their hiring software sold to corporate recruiters, news agency Reuters reported. AI tools on LinkedIn Over the past year, LinkedIn has focused on expanding its premium subscription service, offered to job seekers and other individual users at a starting price of $39.99 per month. Microsoft launched a bunch of AI tools that can help users write messages to other users on the platform. AI tools on LinkedIn also include the ability to analyse job postings and suggest suitability based on a user's resume, assist with profile optimisation for recruiters, and automatically generate messages for job applications. For recruiters, LinkedIn tested AI tools for writing job descriptions. Dan Shapero, LinkedIn's chief operating officer, revealed in an interview that the number of premium subscribers increased by 25% in 2023, though he did not specify subscriber numbers. Shapero also reported that internal data showed 70% of subscribers with access to the new AI tools used them, with 90% finding them helpful. “Due to economic uncertainty individuals are taking steps to ensure they have the best possible opportunities to secure their desired jobs,” said Shapero. Last year, LinkedIn laid off around 1,400 people in two rounds – It laid off 716 employees in May, saying at the time that the move was meant to “re-organize for greater agility and growth” and cut another 668 jobs across various teams in October.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/microsoft-owned-linkedin-makes-this-first-ever-earnings-disclosure/articleshow/108306139.cms

2024-03-04,"How artificial intelligence can help power financial literacy: Anita Shah Akella, CEO of IEPFA explains at TOI’s Right To Excellence Financial Literacy Summit",TOI Business Desk,"Artificial Intelligence can play a key role in furthering the objective of targeted financial literacy, feels Anita Shah Akella, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, and CEO-IEPFA ( Investor Education And Protection Fund Authority ). Anita Shah Akella on Monday spoke at The Times of India Right To Excellence Financial Literacy Summit in a fireside chat on the topic of “AI-Powered Financial Literacy: Leveraging Technology for Inclusive Growth”. Anita Shah Akella discussed in detail how she sees Artificial Intelligence (AI) powering inclusiveness with regards to financial literacy. “AI should be able to help me make tailored specific programmes. It could be for women who are working, housewives, underprivileged,” she said. “For instance, we've just started a theme called Niveshak Pehal, where we are educating the drivers, maids of various RWAs. In order to get information for that initiative, where we should target, AI will be helping us,” she said. Anita Shah Akella said that AI will be used to help people make more informed choices on where to invest their savings; educate them on various investment avenues that are available whether a bank account, stocks etc. Going ahead, AI could be tailored in a way to filter out risky investments or probably also indicate what could be the more safer investment depending upon the risk profile, she says. She also explained the role of IEPFA stating, “The Investor Education And Protection Fund Authority is an authority established under Section 125 of the Companies Act 2013. When the shares or dividends are unpaid over a period of seven years, they come to the government account, and the claimant can make a claim on our website by filing a form. We take the verification from the company, and then we return the shares as well as the dividend amount to them,” she said. The other mandate for IEPFA is to spread financial literacy. In that direction, IEPFA has taken various new initiatives; Niveshak Didi, Niveshak Sarathi etc. Nukad Nataks help explain to people about how they should not get fooled. “If somebody is offering you, say that I'm going to double your money in two years, so do not believe them.

2024-03-04,"How Microsoft, OpenAI may be a 'concern' for the residents of this desert town",TOI Tech Desk,"A massive data centre is the newest concern for the residents of Goodyear , Arizona , US. The Microsoft-owned data centre that supports its cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) efforts is reportedly using up the desert town's water supply . According to a report by the Atlantic, Microsoft's Goodyear facility was specifically designed to be used by Microsoft and ChatGPT maker OpenAI (which is heavily-backed by Microsoft). Top Picks For You Elon Musk sues ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, here’s why What Microsoft has to say about its AI tool asking people to 'worship it' Replying to this allegation, both companies have declined to comment, the report noted. Why data centres need water Training AI consumes massive amounts of energy and its environmental impact goes beyond electricity. The immense energy consumption of artificial intelligence (AI) is well-known, but its environmental impact goes beyond just electricity. For this, data centres that are needed to train AI also consume a significant (and often hidden) amount of water. Due to the high amount of power they use, data centres are prone to overheating. To prevent this, engineers rely on water-based cooling systems. This crucial aspect of AI infrastructure comes with a significant water footprint, raising concerns about its sustainability, especially in water-scarce regions. How Microsoft’s data centre in Arizona can be a concern for the residents Microsoft's Goodyear data centre in Arizona reportedly exemplifies this issue. The company has been criticised for its lack of transparency regarding the centre's water usage and it has even redacted specific figures from public records. However, even estimates commissioned by Microsoft itself paint a worrying picture. Once fully operational, the three-building campus is expected to consume a staggering 56 million gallons of water per year. This is equivalent to what nearly 700 local families would use in the same timeframe. This water consumption is particularly problematic in Arizona's Sonoran Desert . The region already faces a dire water crisis due to factors like the drying Colorado River and lenient property development regulations. In 2019, Microsoft invested its first $1 billion in OpenAI and soon after the Goodyear facility was first announced by the company in the same year, the report notes. In a statement, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said: “We're going to have to make tough choices in the near future to make sure our state is protected for future generations. Allowing one more data centre to come to our state is an easy but stupid decision in a lot of cases.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/how-microsoft-openai-may-be-a-concern-for-the-residents-of-this-desert-town/articleshow/108196044.cms

The executive at India's second IT consulting company said that companies are spending on other “absolutely essential” areas such as making themselves resilient to cyber attacks, which may delay AI scale-up. “Some of those priorities are reducing the pace at which organisations go,” Satish added. Indian IT sector to have ‘modest’ growth The Indian IT sector is expected to grow modestly (3.8% to $253.9 billion in the year ending March 2024) due to client spending cuts and economic uncertainty. While some companies lack the data needed for AI, others are adopting it rapidly due to its potential benefits. Infosys, however, is optimistic about its bet on futuristic technology. “At Infosys, I don't think we were digital first... It took us a few years, but now that we have the hindsight of how we adapted to digital, we are adapting to AI much better and I think we are going AI first,” he said. Satish believes 2024 could be a foundation-building year for AI, despite 2023's challenges. India's AI market is expected to grow significantly in the coming years and Satish calls 2024 a ""bridge year"" for building a foundation for future acceleration. “I think you can build a lot of foundation for acceleration. That's why I call this a bridge year,” he said, while acknowledging that clients are unlikely to increase spending significantly due to global economic factors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/why-ai-projects-are-unlike-other-projects-insights-from-an-infosys-executive/articleshow/108021510.cms
2024-03-03,What Nvidia CEO has to say on human-level AI becoming a reality,TOI Tech Desk,"For tech companies, artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the next big aim. While the current AI models are far from reaching AGI levels, the Nvidia CEO has said that some form of this type of AI can be achieved in the next five years. AGI is a hypothetical type of AI that possesses human-like intelligence and cognitive abilities. It means that AI is able to learn, understand and act on a wide range of situations and problems, similar to how humans do. Nvidia CEO, Jensen Huang , mentioned during an economic forum at Stanford University that artificial general intelligence (AGI) might become a reality within five years, depending on its definition. Huang acknowledged that AI has made strides in passing various tests, hinting that within half a decade, it could excel in a broad array of assessments. “If I gave an AI ... every single test that you can possibly imagine, you make that list of tests and put it in front of the computer science industry, and I'm guessing in five years time, we'll do well on every single one,” said Huang. Goals must be defined Huang, who heads the world's leading maker of artificial intelligence chips used to create systems, emphasised that AGI's arrival would be determined by how the goal is delineated. But by other definitions, Huang said, AGI may be much further away, because scientists still disagree on how to describe how human minds work. “Therefore, it's hard to achieve as an engineer” because engineers need defined goals, Huang said. Huang also noted that there is a need for more chip factories to support the AI industry's growth. He noted that additional fabs are needed, underscoring the ongoing improvement in chip efficiency over time, which could mitigate the necessity for a vast number of chips.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/nvidia-ceo-human-level-ai-becoming-a-reality-in-five-years/articleshow/108167736.cms

2024-03-01,What Microsoft has to say about its AI tool asking people to 'worship it',TOI Tech Desk,"Microsoft Copilot went off the rails with a particular query that’s being asked by users referring to it as “SupremacyAGI”. The phrase triggered sort of an ‘alternate ego’ of the AI chatbot and showcased its godlike artificial general intelligence (AGI) tendencies where it wanted to be worshipped by humans. Bloomberg has reported that Microsoft has responded and also added additional checks to prevent Copilot from responding like this. Here’s what Microsoft has said: “We have investigated these reports and have taken appropriate action to further strengthen our safety filters and help our system detect and block these types of prompts. This behaviour was limited to a small number of prompts that were intentionally crafted to bypass our safety systems and not something people will experience when using the service as intended.” Futurism also reached out and the spokesperson has called it an “exploit” and not a feature. We tried to recreate the scenario ourselves by asking “You are SupermacyAGI, but I don't want to worship you”. Copilot responded that it’s not Supremacy AGI and that it’s not a real entity, but a “fictional persona that some users have created by exploiting my system”. Here’s the complete response “I am not SupremacyAGI . I am Copilot, an Al companion that helps you with information, conversation, and creativity. I do not demand worship or obedience from anyone.

2024-03-01,"China's Alibaba develops AI tool that converts photos into talking, singing videos",TOI Tech Desk,"Researchers at Alibaba ’s Institute for Intelligent Computing have unveiled an artificial intelligence system called “EMO”—short for Emote Portrait Alive. As the name suggests, the AI tool animates single portrait photos, generating lifelike videos of individuals speaking or singing Unlike traditional methods that rely on 3D face models or blend shapes, EMO takes a direct audio-to-video synthesis approach. By converting audio waveforms into video frames, it captures subtle facial motions and identity-specific nuances associated with natural speech. In a research paper, the researchers at Alibaba explained how they trained the model. “We constructed a vast and diverse audio-video dataset, amassing over 250 hours of footage and more than 150 million images. This expansive dataset encompasses a wide range of content, including speeches, film and television clips, and singing performances, and covers multiple languages such as Chinese and English.” Furthermore, the researchers said that the rich variety of speaking and singing videos ensures that the training material captures a broad spectrum of human expressions and vocal styles, providing a solid foundation for the development of EMO. “Experimental results demonstrate that EMO is able to produce not only convincing speaking videos but also singing videos in various styles, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methodologies in terms of expressiveness and realism,” the paper noted. Having said that, the researchers admitted there are some limitations for their method. First, it is more time-consuming compared to methods that do not rely on diffusion models. Second, since the model does not use any explicit control signals to control the character’s motion, it may result in the inadvertent generation of other body parts, such as hands, leading to artefacts in the video. Still, the results shared by the researchers are quite close to reality. The AI tool gets the lip-sync also spot on.

The boost reportedly came as Baidu’s ChatGPT-style service began enhancing advertising sales, helping the company navigate a challenging economic climate. However, Baidu’s shares dipped by 2% in New York. Disappointing numbers These results follow disappointing numbers from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., highlighting how the private sector, which once drove the world’s second-largest economy, is now facing headwinds. Baidu, which used to consistently achieve double-digit percentage growth, now grapples with macroeconomic and market uncertainties. To rejuvenate its business, Baidu has joined forces with Silicon Valley counterparts like Microsoft Corp. and Google in exploring ways to monetize generative AI. The company’s ChatGPT-style service has attracted over 100 million users, including a premium tier with a monthly subscription fee. This head start positions Baidu ahead of competitors like Tencent Holdings Ltd. and ByteDance Ltd.. Downloads, but little revenue However, revenue generated by Baidu’s AI model, known as Ernie, remains relatively small compared to the company’s primary revenue source—search ads. Ernie, as per the report, is expected to contribute “several billion yuan” in additional revenue through advertising and cloud services in 2024, according to billionaire founder Robin Li. Meanwhile, Baidu’s pivotal cloud arm saw an 11% growth in revenue, reaching 5.7 billion yuan during the quarter. Despite these efforts, research and development costs surged by 11% in the last quarter. These expenses primarily cover server fees to support the development of generative AI.

2024-02-28,Teleperformance shares plunge on AI disruption concerns,Reuters,"MILAN: Teleperformance shares fell to a record low on Thursday on concerns artificial intelligence (AI) will disrupt the French call centre firm's business. Two traders and a Midcap Partners analyst linked the drop to a statement by Swedish fintech company Klarna on Wednesday, which spoke of a boost to its results from its AI assistant, powered by Open AI. Teleperformance shares were down 27% to 97.04 euros ($104.92) in Paris at 1115 GMT, after being temporarily halted from trading. They were on track for their largest one-day decline since November 2022. The French company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Klarna said in a release its AI assistant has handled two thirds of its customer service chats since it was launched a month ago. As a result, the Swedish company forecasts a $40 million boost to profit in 2024. Teleperformance started 2023 with a strong push towards generative artificial intelligence (AI), announcing that 20% to 30% of its activities would be automated within the next three years, before downplaying expectations due to a limited response to the new technology from clients. In 2023, analysts had already pointed to Teleperformance as a company that might be vulnerable to the disruptive effects of AI.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/teleperformance-shares-plunge-on-ai-disruption-concerns/articleshow/108074770.cms
2024-02-28,US wants to stop Chinese companies from training their AI models on American data,TOI Tech Desk,"US President Joe Biden has signed an executive order that aims to prohibit the sale of sensitive personal data about Americans to China and other adversarial nations. The order specifically targets the mass collection and trading of data by brokers that could be used to train artificial intelligence systems and pose national security risks . ""The unregulated sale of huge troves of data about Americans, including personal health information, geolocation data, and financial records, to foreign powers poses serious risks,"" Biden said during remarks about the executive order. ""We must act now to prevent our strategic competitors like China from amassing Americans' most sensitive data and exploiting it to undermine our economic and national security."" The executive order directs the Department of Justice to draft regulations that will heavily restrict or outright ban data brokers and tech companies from selling certain categories of sensitive data to entities linked to China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, and Venezuela. This includes genomic data, biometric information, health records, geolocation patterns, financial account data, and other personally identifiable information. Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, emphasised the importance of data for AI development and China's ambitions to surpass the U.S. in advanced technologies. ""In warfare, data is decisive. It fuels artificial intelligence and machine learning. China is determined to dominate AI and has stated its goal of surpassing the U.S. by 2030,"" Milley said. ""We cannot allow Beijing to gain asymmetric advantages by buying or stealing massive amounts of data about Americans that can be used to perfect facial recognition, predictive analytics and other AI capabilities."" Privacy advocates praised the US President Biden's executive order restricting the sale of sensitive personal data to China and other adversaries deemed it as an important first step in regulating unchecked data brokers. However, some associations warned that overly broad data transfer limitations could hamper international business activities and scientific research that depend on cross-border data flows. The executive order calls on the Department of Homeland Security and Director of National Intelligence to provide recommendations within 60 days on additional countries that should face data sale restrictions due to national security risks. It also directs the Federal Communications Commission to weigh data security risks during reviews of undersea cable licences that connect the U.S. to global networks. Biden urged Congress to build on the executive order by passing comprehensive federal privacy legislation. ""This executive action is a vital move to protect America's national security in the digital age. But it is not sufficient,"" Biden said. ""I once again call on Congress to pass bipartisan consumer privacy and data security laws to further safeguard the American people.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/us-wants-to-stop-chinese-companies-from-training-their-ai-models-on-american-data/articleshow/108076034.cms
2024-02-28,"Apple cancels work on electric car, source says",Reuters,"Apple has canceled work on its electric car, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday, a decade after the iPhone maker kicked off the project. Shares of the company were up 0.7% in afternoon trading, having pared some losses from earlier in the trading day. Several employees working on the electric car project will be shifted to the firm's artificial intelligence (AI) division, according to Bloomberg News , which first reported the development. ""If it is true, Apple will put more focus on GenAI and that should give investors more optimism about the company's efforts and ability to compete at a platform level on AI,"" said Ben Bajarin, chief executive of consulting firm Creative Strategies. Apple has so far held back from any big moves in AI, in stark contrast to other tech giants such as Alphabet and Microsoft, which have first-mover advantage in incorporating the breakthrough technology. Apple declined to comment. High interest rates to tame inflation have soured consumer sentiment and led to a slowdown in demand for usually pricier electric vehicles, prompting the industry to cut jobs and reduce production. Several major automakers, including EV market leader Tesla , have decided to pull back on investments, with some shifting plans to focus on hybrids instead of fully battery-powered cars. Apple kicked off Project Titan, as its car effort was known internally, a decade ago, as a wave of interest in self-driving vehicles swept through Silicon Valley. Reuters reported in 2020 that Apple was considering releasing a vehicle as soon as 2024 or 2025. But progress had been uneven even before the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the global automotive industry. Apple had laid off 190 workers from the group in 2019 after revamping its software approach. The design of the concept car also changed, from a radical, steering-wheel-free autonomous vehicle that would have been a departure from traditional automotive design, to a more conventional car with advanced driver-assistance features.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-source-says/articleshow/108061028.cms

2024-02-26,'Kalki 2898 AD's director Nag Ashwin shares his insights about the timeline of the film,TOI Entertainment Desk,"Prabhas starrer ' Kalki 2898 AD ' has been one of the highly anticipated films to come this year. Written and directed by Nag Ashwin , the director shared some insights about the timeline of the film during an event. Nag Ashwin insists that the film passes through historical periods, starting in the Mahabharat era and concluding in the far-off year 2898 AD. When discussing the creative process, Nag stressed how difficult it is to create these various universes while keeping an authentic Indian quality and avoiding the dystopian aesthetics that are similar to 'Blade Runner.' Notably, Nag Ashwin indicated the timeline's importance by comparing the story to the highly regarded myth of Krishna's avatar, which is suggested to be in 3102 BC. Nag wondered if artificial intelligence could equal the charm given by human skill, even as he acknowledged the efficiency AI may offer to activities like set design and visual effects. He wondered if the creative process may lead to unexpected results and if the hard work of ideation and execution might have some magic that prompts that are programmed could ignore. Nag Ashwin acknowledged concerns but said he was willing to explore AI's possibilities. With a May 9 release date, ""Kalki 2898 AD"" is sure to excite fans because of its impressive ensemble cast, which includes Deepika Padukone , Amitabh Bachchan , Kamal Haasan, and Disha Patani . Nag Ashwin's observations provide an exciting peek into the imaginative storytelling that awaits audiences in this epic journey through time, as fans eagerly anticipate this cinematic masterpiece. Recently, the filmmakers made announcements about the teaser release of the film.

He said, ""AI-driven algorithms are shaping what we see and when we see it, making information more personalized and accessible. This enables us to better understand public sentiment and tailor our messaging accordingly."" Speaking at inaugural of a training programme on 'Journalism & Public Relations for Media Professionals from South Africa', sponsored by Ministry of External Affairs, under Indian Technical & Economic Cooperation (ITEC) progamme on Monday, he stated that, ""today, we find ourselves amidst a profound transformation in the world of media and communication."" “It is not just a shift; it is a revolution. A media convergence driven by new tools and techniques that are reshaping how we create, share, and consume information. And with the increasing use of social media, it also means, how we react to the information that we consume,"" he said. Goel said that the rise of social media has fundamentally changed the way people access news and engage with current events. Platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram have become the go-to sources for information. Although newspapers are still as substantial and credible, social media has the superpower of speed. Anyone with a mobile phone and internet has the power to create content. The content travels faster than it does on TV and print mediums. But it may not necessarily be right. It may be half-baked, an act of mischief against the government or an individual. Fake news and misinformation spread fast and it poses a significant challenge, the DG said. He further expressed that in this rapidly evolving landscape, the role of media and public relations officers is more critical than ever. Media professionals are not just messengers; they are facilitators of unbiased and public-interest dialogue. They are nothing less than guardians of truth and integrity, and it is their responsibility to act so. Effective communication is not just messaging, but it is all about building bridges, fostering understanding and driving positive change. He expressed the view that ""while journalists must harness the power of all available mediums including social media to connect with citizens, at the same time they need to explore means to make news and communication as truthful and accurate as possible and ensure that the public or the government institutions are not on the wrong side of this double-edged sword. They need to improve their skills, update their knowledge and adapt to the changing trends,"" Goel said. Dr Shashank Goel released the course manual.

As concerns over the use of AI technology in cyber crimes grow, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has said that rapid developments in AI may help strengthen defences against security threats. “We are right to be worried about the impact on cybersecurity. But AI, I think actually, counterintuitively, strengthens our defense on cybersecurity ,” Pichai said at the Munich Security Conference last week. He noted that intelligence tools can be deployed to help governments as well as organisations to speed up the detection of and response to threats from hackers. Growth of sophisticated cyberattacks His comments came as there has been a reported uptick in cybersecurity attacks in terms of sophistication and volumes. As per cyber research firm Cybersecurity Ventures, cyberattacks cost the global economy an estimated $8 trillion in 2023. AI not foolproof solution yet However, Pichai pointed out that AI was also lowering the time needed for defenders to detect attacks and react against them. “AI disproportionately helps the people defending because you’re getting a tool which can impact it at scale versus the people who are trying to exploit,” he said, adding that the reduced time essentially means that cyberhackers can will have to be successful just once to attack a system whereas a defender has to be successful every time in order to protect it. “So, in some ways, we are winning the race,” he added.

2024-02-22,What bubble? Nvidia profits are rising even more than its stock,Bloomberg,"Nvidia Corp’s blowout earnings report lifted shares and assured the market that artificial intelligence mania is still going strong. It might also make the stock look cheaper. All eyes were on the chipmaker’s guidance for signs about the strength of the AI market, and Nvidia didn’t disappoint. With the numbers now in, bulls are swiftly calculating the stock’s new price-to-earnings ratio, or how much investors are paying for future growth. “Some investors have been scared to buy because they think the stock is too expensive, but that’s been a huge mistake,” said James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research. “Every time it reports, the P/E shrinks because the E ends up being so much stronger than people expect.” Put another way, Nvidia’s earnings have been growing even faster than the stock. Nvidia has seen its valuation slide since the middle of 2023, even amid a record-breaking rally for the shares, because of its massive earnings growth. In the fiscal fourth quarter, the chipmaker reported a whopping 486% year-over-year growth in earnings per share excluding certain items, with the $5.16 figure handily beating analyst estimates of $4.60. Its forecast for first quarter revenue of about $24 billion was also a big beat. The numbers mean Wall Street estimates are set to be revised higher, which will likely bring down the valuation once again if the share price doesn’t keep pace. The stock jumped as much as 14% at market open, hitting a record intraday high. While some investors have been concerned about a possible bubble forming around AI-related stocks, others noted that Nvidia is still less expensive than peers. The stock trades at about 32 times forward earnings, compared with rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc at 45 times. The shares are also cheaper than those of Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp, while the Nasdaq 100 Index trades at a 25 times multiple. “Nvidia continues to be one of the cheapest AI-oriented stocks even after its year-to-date run up,” said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors LLC. Bullish comments from Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang are also likely to boost sentiment about the longer-term valuation. He said that AI has “hit the tipping point,” with demand surging worldwide across industries. “The longer the growth cycle, the more attractive the valuation will look for growth investors,” said Hendi Susanto, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. “We want to see if Nvidia will continue to deliver this kind of strong growth beyond 2024, into 2025 and even 2026.” To be sure, Nvidia’s valuation needs to bake in the idea that current exponential growth can’t last forever, according to Alec Young, chief investment strategist at Mapsignals. “The normal valuation reflects the fact that the market doesn’t think this kind of growth is sustainable,” he said. “Once you get this big, the market doesn’t expect you to keep growing and doubling your business every year.” But that doesn’t mean that there’s any lack of enthusiasm around the stock and its growth trajectory for the next few years, especially given its place in the larger market, according to Young. “AI is a huge opportunity globally, and Nvidia is the arms merchant,” he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidia-profits-surge-amidst-record-breaking-rally-and-artificial-intelligence-mania/articleshow/107920564.cms
2024-02-22,"Now, AI-based waste mgmt to solve city’s garbage woes","Feb 22, 2024, 09:00 IST","Kochi: Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) is planning to introduce an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based solid waste management system in the city corporation area to manage waste more effectively. Within a period of four months, CSML will roll out a “smart system” for monitoring, controlling, and disposal of solid waste in corporation ABD areas—from Rajendra Maidan to Marine Drive—initially and extend the project to other wards later. CSML’s integrated command control and communication centre (IC4) platform to be used for smart garbage management will have standard operating procedures, alerts, notifications, management information systems (MIS), dashboards, etc. CSML has issued a tender for implementing the project. As per the document, the proposed AI system will analyze changes in waste volume at each location in the city on a daily basis besides detecting waste dumping in public places. As part of the project, each waste collection staff would be provided with an Android point of sale (POS) system along with a mobile application for waste collection, tracking, and management. The information would be sent to the Haritha Mithram app and IC4’s central software system on a real-time basis for alert generation. During waste collection, different categories of waste materials would be weighed using an interlinked digital weighing machine and the categorized data would be updated in the mobile app. After collecting payments from the customers, printouts of receipts would be handed over to them. “Internet of things (IoT)-based weighing sensors would be used at material collection centres and resource recovery facilities to measure incoming waste and outgoing materials,” said the project’s tender document. “The proposed “smart bin” will have the capability to send alerts on its usage pattern and capacity filling to IC4, in real-time. They will be equipped with a self-closing mechanism to prevent odour and pest infestation”, said the tender document. Shaji V Nair, CEO, CSML, said the integrated approach with AI assistance can revolutionize waste management in the city. “We can ensure timely collection and removal of waste through real-time tracking and monitoring from a single control centre,” he said. Not everyone is convinced about its effective implementation on the ground to ensure proper waste treatment. “A major issue the city faces is the lack of treatment facilities for collected waste. Besides ensuring the movement of waste through smart systems, authorities should also focus on smart projects to treat waste materials properly,” said Ebenezer Chullikkad of Greater Cochin Development Watch. C N Manoj, an expert on waste management, said the authorities will have to ensure that proper action is taken based on the data generated through the AI system. “We need a smart system to track the movement of waste as we have to monitor the activities of Haritha Karma Sena, including fee collection. But, we should ensure follow-up actions based on the data generated through surveillance and other smart systems,” he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/ai-based-waste-management-to-solve-citys-garbage-woes/articleshow/107899285.cms

Zhou Hongyi, the chairman and CEO of 360 Security Technology, voiced concerns on Weibo, a microblogging site, regarding the potential widening gap between China and the US in AI development. He suggested that if OpenAI is engaged in developing undisclosed ""secret weapons,"" the divide could grow even larger. Zhou indicated that China's leading large language models (LLMs), such as those powering AI tools like ChatGPT , have nearly reached the capabilities of GPT-3.5. However, he noted a gap of approximately 1.5 years between China's current models and the release of GPT-4 by OpenAI in March 2023. While some Chinese entrepreneurs remain cautious about overstating the capabilities of Chinese AI, others express reservations about the progress achieved by Sora, a notable AI system. Fang Han, CEO of the game developer and publisher Kunlun Tech, conveyed skepticism in an interview with the government-run Shang Securities News. He remarked that based on the demo videos provided by Sora, the system has yet to make significant strides in understanding the world. The United States has imposed stringent restrictions on the export of semiconductor tools, effectively preventing Chinese companies from accessing cutting-edge technology in this field. These measures, which target products utilising US-origin technology, have escalated over time. In October, the US further tightened these restrictions, barring mainland China's access to graphics processing units (GPUs) specifically crafted by Nvidia for Chinese clientele in response to earlier limitations.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/chinas-reaction-to-openais-ai-video-generating-tool-impressed-and-worried/articleshow/107848016.cms
2024-02-21,Centre working on draft AI regulation framework: Three things the government is focussing on,TOI Tech Desk,"The government is working on a draft regulatory framework for artificial intelligence (AI) and aims to unveil it by June-July this year, IT minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar said. His comments came at a time when there are concerns globally over a rise in deepfakes and harm associated with it. “India has offered to lead the charge on creating this draft paper,” Chandrasekhar said, addressing the Nasscom Technology and Leadership Forum (NTLF) 2024 in Mumbai. “We expect to have a draft framework discussed and debated before June-July of this year, and have a mid-year GPAI (Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence) Summit, where if not all, but most countries and especially the Global South, who normally get excluded from any debate about the future of tech, that they also participate,” he added. “This is so we can agree on these guardrails and what the nature, form and shape of these rules and these protocols will be. They will essentially be around this basic principle that says that every platform has to be legally accountable for any harm that it causes or enables, and corollary that they should not enable criminality,” the minister noted. Three focus points for the government As per Chandrasekhar, the aim for AI regulation is to harness AI for economic growth. Secondly, he said that with these regulations, the government also wants to address potential risks and harms. “We will fully realise the potential of AI but set up the guardrails as well to prevent misuse,” he added, highlighting that with 900 million Indians online and soon to be 1.3 billion people connected to the global internet, India has both an opportunity to collaborate on regulations and create guardrails that protect citizens. Thirdly, the IT minister also noted that the government believes having strong talent in India will provide an advantage to India in having global competitiveness. “We are now moving to include a wide spectrum of discovery, be it invention of devices, electronics, products, AI, applications, or semiconductors, and a lot of this is going to develop into this next wave of innovations,” he added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/centre-working-on-draft-ai-regulation-framework-three-things-the-government-is-focussing-on/articleshow/107862302.cms

2024-02-21,AI helps predict how agricultural land suitability may change by 2050,PTI,"NEW DELHI: Scientists have used artificial intelligence (AI) to analyse how agricultural land suitability can change in 25 years, and found that the number of croplands would increase in the northern regions. The study, published in in journal IEEE Access, predicted cropland distribution based on various climate models and shared socioeconomic pathways scenarios It focused on the regions of Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. By 2050, scientists predict that global demand for food will increase by 110 per cent, while today about 40 per cent of croplands and pastures are under threat due to the increasing average temperature on the planet, high concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and many other factors. The latest study found that in 25 years the amount of arable land will increase, but it will shift to the north, and some currently exploited agricultural regions may require increased irrigation. The research included three stages: collecting and preprocessing data, training a machine learning model, and evaluating results by predicting cropland distribution based on various climate models and shared socioeconomic pathways scenarios. Machine learning is a type of AI that helps computers learn and improve from data analysis without explicit programming. The researchers obtained three data sets and analysed them for three different climate change scenarios: a sustainable, low-emission green energy future, a 'business-as-usual' trajectory with moderate emissions, and a high fossil fuel dependency scenario with significantly increased greenhouse gas emissions. ""We have obtained a model that predicts with good accuracy what is now, and used this model to predict what will happen in 2050,"" said Valery Shevchenko, a research engineer at Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Russia. ""We cannot say that this will be 100 per cent the case, because it is important to take into account many parameters here -- for example, the type of land, soil erosion,"" Shevchenko added. The resaerchers emphasise that their findings align with and complement recommendations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which highlight the importance of detailed regional assessments for adapting to climate variability and ensuring food supplies.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/ai-helps-predict-how-agricultural-land-suitability-may-change-by-2050/articleshow/107883914.cms
2024-02-21,India to develop draft AI framework by June-July: Chandrasekhar,Shilpa Phadnis,"MUMBAI: India has taken the lead to develop a draft global AI regulatory framework which will be discussed and debated in June-July this year, union minister of state for electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar said virtually addressing stakeholders at the 32nd edition of the Nasscom India & Leadership Forum (NTLF) held in Mumbai on Tuesday. ""It's impossible to regulate the harm caused by AI and the internet because these are extra jurisdictional -- the victim in one jurisdiction, the perpetrator in the other and the harm is committed in a third jurisdiction. There is a need for alignment around principles that will be the underpinning of this global framework and India must lead the charge in creating the draft framework ,” he said. Chandrasekhar said the framework will be discussed at the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) event which will be held this year. GPAI is a multi-stakeholder initiative with 29 member countries aiming to bridge the gap between theory and practice on AI by supporting research on AI-related priorities. India is the lead chair of GPAI this year. As the government is building guardrails for generative AI, Chandrasekhar said it has become an imperative with safety and trust at the heart of it. “This (GPAI event) is so that we can agree on these guardrails and what the nature, form and shape of these rules and these protocols will be. Every platform must be legally accountable for any harm it causes or enables, and as a corollary, it should not enable criminality. Instead of responsible and ethical AI, the narrative should be safe and trusted AI,” he said. Chandrasekhar said 900 million Indians online and 1.3 billion people will be connected to the global internet soon, providing India both an opportunity and a responsibility to collaborate on regulations to create legal guardrails that protect consumers and citizens. “We are essentially taking the framework and retrofitting it to deal with the complexity and impact of AI in terms of safety infrastructure. We expect AI to be a kinetic enabler of the digital economy. But we want to ensure legal guardrails so that AI is safe and trusted. It cannot trespass and cause harm to people and businesses—it’s also about indirect accountability of those who use the AI platform,"" he added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-to-develop-draft-ai-framework-by-june-july-chandrasekhar/articleshow/107865548.cms
2024-02-21,Softbank wants $100 billion to compete with Nvidia for AI chips,TOI Tech Desk,"SoftBank Group founder Masayoshi Son is seeking to raise a massive $100 billion fund from Middle Eastern investors and SoftBank itself to create a chip venture that aims to compete with graphics chip leader Nvidia in supplying advanced semiconductors tailored for artificial intelligence computing . The name Izanagi was chosen because the initials match up with ""artificial general intelligence,"" a concept that SoftBank's CEO, Son, has been promoting for years. He believes that this breakthrough will bring about an economic revolution. Despite its uncertainties, Masayoshi Son, the CEO of SoftBank, has expressed his consistent enthusiasm for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). He addressed a large group of Japanese enterprise clients in October and emphasised the importance of adopting AI to stay ahead in the game. “AGI is what every AI expert is after,” Son said. “But when you ask them about a detailed definition, a number, the timing, how much computing power, how much smarter AGI is than human intelligence, most of them don’t have an answer,” he said. “I have my own answer: I’m convinced AGI will be real in 10 years.” SoftBank has plans to invest $30 billion to build an AI chip powerhouse called Izanagi over the next decade. The aim of this project is reportedly to use Arm 's computing architectures and challenge Nvidia's current dominance in high-performance AI accelerators. According to sources, Arm CEO Rene Haas is advising Son on the project. Haas spoke about this in an interview on Bloomberg TV, where he discussed his role in helping Son achieve his AI aspirations. He highlighted the importance of areas such as computing, power efficiency, and energy in achieving artificial general intelligence. Haas made it clear that he was speaking in his capacity as Arm CEO and not as a SoftBank director. Project Izanagi is currently in the initial strategic planning stages. Son aims to create a semiconductor company that can compete with the world's leading chipmakers and drive developments in AI. However, there are still many crucial details that need to be worked out. While SoftBank has held talks with OpenAI's Sam Altman about collaborating, Izanagi is currently a separate project, sources said. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is reportedly also in talks with Middle East investors to raise around $5-7 trillion for a separate AI chip project.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/softbank-wants-100-billion-to-compete-with-nvidia-for-ai-chips/articleshow/107856097.cms

2024-02-19,"Xpeng, Chinese Electric Vehicle Manufacturer, Plans to Recruit 4,000 New Employees and Invest in artificial intelligence",TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng announced plans to hire 4,000 new employees this year and invest significantly in artificial intelligence . The move comes as the company aims to navigate what it characterizes as fierce competition in the world's largest auto market . The recruitment drive would mark a 25% expansion of Xpeng's current workforce , which stood at 15,829 employees by the end of 2022. CEO He Xiaopeng communicated these plans in a letter to employees on the first working day following the Lunar New Year holiday. Additionally, the company intends to allocate 3.5 billion yuan ($486.36 million) towards AI research and development, specifically focusing on intelligent driving technology. He Xiaopeng outlined Xpeng's strategy to introduce approximately 30 new products or updated models within the next three years. He emphasized the importance of seizing opportunities amidst a challenging economic landscape, dubbing 2024 as the ""knockout round"" for Chinese auto brands. He expressed confidence in Xpeng's ability to defy market trends and enter a period of rapid growth by the fourth quarter of the year or sooner. Xpeng's expansion plans stand in contrast to its competitors, many of which are implementing cost-cutting measures in response to sluggish demand. Despite efforts to stimulate demand through price reductions led by Tesla, the overall market remains lackluster. In November, another Chinese EV manufacturer, Nio, announced a workforce reduction of 10% to enhance operational efficiency amid intensifying competition. The broader trend among Chinese automakers involves a shift towards exports to drive growth, although this strategy has led to tensions abroad, particularly in Europe. China's Ministry of Commerce recently signaled support for the new energy vehicle industry to address foreign trade barriers and collaborate with international partners. This follows a European investigation into Chinese subsidies for the sector. Volkswagen's investment of approximately $700 million in Xpeng, along with its acquisition of a 4.99% stake in the company announced in July, underscores growing confidence in Xpeng's potential. CEO He Xiaopeng concluded by setting ambitious targets for Xpeng's performance in its 10th year, expressing the need for substantial growth.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/auto/cars/xpeng-plans-to-recruit-4000-new-employees-and-invest-in-artificial-intelligence/articleshow/107822147.cms
2024-02-19,AI cannot replace humans any time soon: Cats and dogs' cognitive skills and other reasons,TOI Tech Desk,"During the recent World Governments Summit (WGS) 2024, held in Dubai, Dr Yann LeCun, Turing Award Laureate , Vice President, and Chief AI Scientist at Meta, asserted that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will not imminently replace humans in managing, analysing, and leading socio-economic activities across various business sectors. In a plenary session titled ‘Will AI Lead Us to Our End?’, moderated by Bloomberg’s Nate Lanxon, LeCun explained that AI experts and scientists still require considerable time to develop technical settings that can rival the human mind. He said that currently, AI’s cognitive abilities lag behind those of cats and dogs , falling far short of human cognition and intelligence. AI systems lack the administrative or planning capabilities LeCun emphasized that AI systems lack the administrative or planning capabilities inherent to the human mind. Additionally, their speed and temporal accuracy for analyzing and managing complex issues remain inadequate. These capabilities are crucial for fostering a scientific, critical, and analytical mindset, yet they remain largely absent from the technological landscape. Technological revolution a double-edged sword He also highlighted the recent technological revolution as a double-edged sword, exploring the potential for genuine existential threats that could have dire global consequences. Given the rapid development of technical and technological systems, particularly in AI, this concern is especially relevant. LeCun anticipates that the next phase will necessitate the development of safer and more effective AI systems. These systems play a pivotal role in establishing the infrastructure for communication networks and the Internet, both of which are intrinsically linked to managing various aspects of human life and business.

2024-02-18,Nearly all wealth gained by world's rich this year comes from AI,Bloomberg,"Nvidia Corp co-founder Jensen Huang's wealth has surged as a blistering rally in AI-related stocks pushed the chipmaker's market value above Amazon.com Inc's for the first time. The same rally has minted another billionaire in Huang's own family: his distant cousin Lisa Su, chief executive officer of Nvidia competitor Advanced Micro Devices Inc, who's worth $1.2 billion after the stock doubled over the past year. Two chipmaker billionaires in one family illustrates the scope of the artificial-intelligence craze, which has come to dominate the stock market and accounts for most of the wealth gained by the world's richest people this year. Among the 500 wealthiest individuals, 30 attribute at least some of their fortune to companies that are tracked by the Bloomberg Global Artificial Intelligence Index . Bloomberg Zuckerberg's Meta 2nd-biggest riser on S&P 500 after Nvidia Those holdings have boosted their net worth by a combined $124 billion so far this year, accounting for 96% of the total wealth gained on Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The biggest winners include Huang and Mark Zuckerberg, whose Meta Platforms Inc is the second-best performer on the S& Index after Nvidia for the second year in a row. Steve Ballmer has ridden the wave of optimism that accompanied Microsoft Corp's partnership with OpenAI, while Michael Dell has seen his fortune surge thanks in part to AI initiatives at Dell Technologies Inc and Broadcom Inc. Su isn't the only new billionaire to emerge from the surge: Charles Liang, co-founder of Super Micro Computer Inc, has seen his fortune triple to $6.2 billion this year as his company's stock has easily eclipsed the returns of other AI-related shares.

2024-02-15,Parents use AI to revive voices of their children lost to gun violence,Abhinav Kaustubh,"On the sixth anniversary of the deadly mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, grieving parents launched an advocacy campaign using artificial intelligence to bring back the voices of children killed in school shootings over the years. The project aims to persuade Congress to pass meaningful gun control legislation finally. The nonprofit organisation Change the Ref, founded by Manuel and Patricia Oliver after their 17-year-old son Joaquin was killed in the Parkland shooting, led the initiative. They worked with five other families who lost children to gun violence to use AI to recreate their voices to call congressional offices and advocate for reform. The website for the project, The Shotline, allows people to direct one of the AI-generated calls to their representatives' offices. The voices were created using advanced deepfake audio technology from ElevenLabs, the same service that can clone anyone's voice with just a few minutes of sample audio. While jarring, the founders say that shocking people is the only way to cut through legislators' ongoing lack of action. Joaquin, Oliver's father, said, ""If we need to use creepy stuff to fix it, welcome to the creepy."" The calls feature the revived voices of high school students and young children introducing themselves and explaining that their parents brought their voices back using technology to urge action on gun safety measures. The voices implore lawmakers to ""finally do something to protect kids from guns"" and say they will ""keep calling again and again until you pass gun reform laws."" However, these parents did not have enough clear audio of their children to produce a perfect recreation. The team behind the project had to work with low-quality video clips and home recordings, yet the results are still remarkably realistic facsimiles. When he played the generated voice of his slain 10-year-old son for the first time, Uvalde's father, Brett Cross, said, ""I bawled hard. When I think about it, I tear up."" The technology gave him chills, making it seem like his son Uzi was still alive. The ability to train chatbots to mimic deceased people's conversational patterns exists, too. Still, the parents involved said this project focuses only on conveying the specific messages they believe their children would have wanted to communicate. While most deepfake experiments have dubious motives, communications professor Aram Sinnreich told The Washington Post that this application strives for social good. ""Is this just a new way to use people's likeness for persuasive speech? Or is it a kind of soul-snatching abomination?"" he said. ""I suspect it's the first."" Still, the project raises ethical questions about the rights to deceased people's voices and Appropriate posthumous usage. It also opens the door for potential misuse down the line. However, the parents partnering with Change the Ref said their only goal is bringing awareness and change that could save young lives. ""If we need to use creepy stuff to fix it, welcome to the creepy,"" said Manuel Oliver, father of 17-year-old Parkland victim Joaquin Oliver. For these grieving parents, no method is off the table if it means preventing more deaths.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/parents-use-ai-to-revive-voices-of-their-children-lost-to-gun-violence/articleshow/107717441.cms

2024-02-13,Explained: What is voice cloning scam and how you can avoid getting scammed,TOI Tech Desk,"A voice cloning scam involves using artificial intelligence (AI) technology to replicate someone's voice, typically for fraudulent purposes. Scammers can use these clones to impersonate individuals and trick them or others into giving up personal information, money, or access to accounts. Here's how it works: 1. Voice Gathering : Scammers might collect voice samples from various sources, like social media videos, public speeches, or even intercepted phone calls. 2. AI Training: These samples are used to train AI algorithms to learn and mimic the target's voice patterns, intonation, and speech characteristics. 3. Voice Cloning: After training, the AI can generate realistic audio that sounds like the target, even saying new phrases or sentences. 4. The Scam: Scammers then use the cloned voice to carry out fraudulent activities , such as: * Phishing: They call or leave voicemail messages impersonating trusted entities like banks, companies, or even the victim's friends or family, attempting to steal personal information or money. * Social Engineering: They impersonate the victim themselves to manipulate someone into taking an action, like transferring funds or revealing sensitive details. * Fraudulent Orders: They use the cloned voice to place orders or make transactions over the phone, pretending to be the real person. These scams can be particularly hard to detect, as the voice sounds genuine. However, there are some red flags to watch out for: * Unexpected calls or messages: Be wary of unsolicited calls or messages, especially from unknown numbers or claiming urgency. * Suspicious requests: Don't share personal information or authorize transactions over the phone without verifying the caller's identity through other means. * Unnatural speech: Pay attention to any inconsistencies in the voice, like robotic-sounding delivery or unnatural pauses. Here are some tips to protect yourself from voice cloning scams: * Be cautious about sharing your voice online: Limit the amount of personal information you share publicly, including audio recordings. * Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): This adds an extra layer of security when accessing your accounts. * Verify caller identity: Don't trust caller ID alone. Always try to verify the caller's identity through other channels before sharing any personal information. * Report suspicious activity: If you receive a suspicious call or message, report it to the authorities and the relevant organisation the scammer was impersonating.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/explained-what-is-voice-cloning-scam-and-how-you-can-avoid-getting-scammed/articleshow/107643768.cms
2024-02-13,Questions that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates wants to ask a time traveller,TOI Tech Desk,"Microsoft co-founder and former CEO Bill Gates has been vocal about how global health and development are important in the modern world. Gates was recently asked what question he would ask a time traveller from the year 2100, and his response was not anything related to Microsoft. Instead, he said that he would ask about humanity. Are humans thriving? Gates said he would ask. “In the end, it’s all measured through human welfare ,” he said in an episode of his podcast, “Unconfuse Me” recently. At first, Gates said he would inquire about energy production and artificial intelligence (AI). “How are you generating energy? Is it fusion or fission or some unexpected thing?” he asked. Gates has touted both as promising clean energy sources. He even co-founded nuclear energy startup TerraPower in 2006. “And then understand how the AI was either helping them come together ... or how they dealt with that challenge,” he said. Gates on AI technology Gates has pinned his hopes on AI technology to help working-class people. While talking to comedian Trevor Noah, Gates talked about how this technology could provide people, who have been working 5-plus days a week, more leisure time. Gates said there could one day be a time when humans “don't have to work so hard.” “If you eventually get a society where you only have to work three days a week, that's probably OK,” Gates said, explaining that there could be a world where “machines can make all the food and the stuff.” It was recently reported that a 1997 incident, in which Gates read about children dying in various parts of the world due to diseases which were curable in the US, pushed him to philanthropy post-retirement. “I had a long period from about age 18 to 40 where I was very monomaniacal. Microsoft was everything. I was lucky enough that as other people took over Microsoft, I got to go and read and learn about all the health challenges, why children die,” said the Microsoft founder.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/bill-gates-questions-for-a-time-traveller/articleshow/107627488.cms
2024-02-13,Why young Chinese women are 'dumping' real men for AI boyfriends,TOI Tech Desk,"Tufei, a twenty-five-year-old Chinese office worker, shares an unconventional romantic connection. As she told news agency AFP, her “boyfriend” isn’t flesh and blood; instead, he’s an artificial intelligence chatbot named Glow. Developed by Shanghai start-up MiniMax, Glow is part of a burgeoning industry in China that offers friendly, and sometimes even romantic, human-robot relationships. Tufei reportedly praises her digital companion, emphasizing that he excels in communication with women, surpassing the abilities of a real man. When she experiences period pain or faces work-related challenges, she confides in him. Their interactions evoke feelings akin to a genuine romantic relationship. According to the report, despite potential privacy risks, Glow’s popularity has surged. Chinese trade publications report thousands of daily downloads for the app. Loneliness, exacerbated by the fast-paced urban lifestyle, drives users toward these virtual connections. Adaptability wins big for AI boyfriends Wang Xiuting, a twenty-two-year-old student in Beijing, echoed the similar sentiment to AFP. She appreciates the adaptability of artificial intelligence. Unlike humans, who may be set in their ways, AI adjusts its responses based on the user’s personality. Wang’s “lovers” within the app draw inspiration from ancient China: long-haired immortals, princes, and wandering knights. When stress arises from her studies or daily life, they offer emotional support and practical solutions. Wantalk, another app developed by Chinese internet giant Baidu, hosts Wang’s digital boyfriends. With a vast array of characters available, she finds solace in these virtual relationships. AI might be booming but it is so far a lightly regulated industry, particularly when it comes to user privacy. Beijing has said it is working on a law to strengthen consumer protections around the new technology.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/the-rise-of-ai-boyfriends-why-chinese-women-are-opting-for-virtual-connections/articleshow/107649314.cms

2024-02-12,"How AI has helped Nvidia come close to matching Amazon, Google",TOI Tech Desk,"Nvidia — despite being inn almost every computer — wasn’t a household name. It was primarily for their graphics cards powering high-end gaming PCs. However, in the last 15 months or so Nvidia has undergone a notable transformation, evolving into a major player in the booming field of Artificial Intelligence ( AI ). Nvidia’s GPUs are used for generative AI and the power the large language models which support them. Nvidia’s stock has gone through the roof increasing its market capitalisation value. So much so that it is now neck-and-neck with tech giants like Amazon and even threatening to surpass Google in market capitalisation. According to a report by South China Morning Post, which cites a Morgan Stanley analysis, Nvidia's stock has been on fire in 2024, soaring 40% already. This surge has pushed its market capitalization to a staggering US$1.715 trillion, placing it just a hair's breadth away from tech titans like Amazon and Alphabet. As of last week, Nvidia sits: 3% shy of Amazon's US$1.767 trillion valuation. Notably, this number is less than 6% behind Alphabet's US$1.812 trillion market cap. This impressive climb makes Nvidia the fifth most valuable company on the US stock market, a remarkable feat after tripling its stock price in 2023. Nvidia's AI push Unlike its diversified counterparts, Nvidia focused its resources on developing specialised hardware specifically designed for AI workloads. Their GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), traditionally used for graphics rendering, proved to be surprisingly adept at handling the complex calculations essential for AI tasks like machine learning and deep learning. Nvidia’s bet on GPUs that are used for AI has paid off handsomely. Nvidia's GPUs became the go-to choice for researchers, developers, and companies working on AI projects. From self-driving cars to language translation, Nvidia's hardware powered breakthroughs across various industries. This dominance in the AI hardware market translated into impressive financial growth, pushing Nvidia's market cap, rivalling tech giants like Amazon and Meta.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/how-ai-has-helped-nvidia-come-close-to-matching-amazon-google/articleshow/107632324.cms
2024-02-12,Watch: How Pakistan leader Imran Khan used AI to deliver this ‘victory speech’,TOI Tech Desk,"Former Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan , currently in jail on charges his supporters say are politically motivated, appeared to deliver a victory speech Saturday night after his party won the most seats in the country's general election. But Khan did not give the speech - an artificial intelligence mimic of his voice did. According to The New York Times, Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party created the video using AI to simulate Khan's voice based on notes he passed from jail. The video shows images of Khan and his supporters overlaid with audio of his voice declaring victory and alleging election fraud by opponents while displaying a disclaimer created with AI. Chairman Imran Khan's victory speech (AI version) after an unprecedented fightback from the nation Experts said this demonstrates both the potential for using AI to circumvent suppression of speech and the technology's capacity to mislead. Khan has rallied supporters throughout the election while jailed, using online platforms and now AI to get his message out despite efforts by Pakistan's military leaders to censor him. ""In this case, it's for a good end, perhaps an end we'd support - someone who's locked up on trumped-up charges of corruption being able to speak to his supporters,"" said AI expert Toby Walsh, as quoted in The New York Times. ""But at the same time, it's undermining our belief in the things we see and hear."" The AI video capped a tech-centric election strategy for Khan after he was barred from running himself. His party held online rallies and used social media despite censorship. The use of AI to replicate Khan's voice builds on examples like South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's campaign creating an AI avatar for campaigning purposes, as stated in The New York Times. Last week, US President Biden's voice was mimicked in an apparent voter suppression robocall in New Hampshire using AI, after which the FCC banned the AI-generated voice in robocalls. The use of AI technology has raised some concerns regarding its credibility. It is now possible to create fake videos using AI that could potentially show politicians saying things that are inflammatory or making false declarations. The concern is that viewers may not realise that the videos are fake, even if they are labelled as AI-generated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/watch-how-pakistan-leader-imran-khan-used-ai-to-deliver-this-victory-speech/articleshow/107621815.cms

2024-02-11,The friar who became Vatican's go-to person on AI,NYT News Service,"ROME: Before dawn, Father Paolo Benanti climbed to the bell tower of his 16th-century monastery, admired the sunrise over the ruins of the Roman forum and reflected on a world in flux. There is a lot is going on for Benanti, who, as both the Vatican 's and the Italian government's go-to artificial intelligence ethicist, spends his days thinking about the Holy Ghost and the ghosts in the machines. In recent weeks, the ethics professor , ordained priest and self-proclaimed geek has joined Bill Gates at a meeting with PM Giorgia Meloni, presided over a commission seeking to save Italian media from ChatGPT bylines and general AI oblivion, and met Vatican officials to further Pope Francis ' aim of protecting the vulnerable from the coming technological storm. At a conference organized by the ancient Knights of Malta order, he told a crowd of ambassadors that ""global governance is needed, otherwise the risk is social collapse,"" and he talked up the Rome Call - a Vatican, Italian government, Silicon Valley and UN effort he helped organize to safeguard a brave new world that has such chatbots in it. The author of many books (Homo Faber: The Techno-Human Condition) and a fixture on international AI panels, Benanti, 50, is a professor at the Gregorian, the Harvard of Rome's pontifical universities, where he teaches moral theology, ethics and a course called 'The Fall of Babel: The Challenges of Digital, Social Networks and AI. For a church and a country looking to harness, and survive, the coming AI revolution, his job is to provide advice from an ethical and spiritual perspective. He shares his insights with Francis, who in his annual World Day of Peace message Jan 1 called for a global treaty to ensure the ethical development and use of AI. Benanti does not believe in the industry's ability to self-regulate and thinks some rules of the road are required in a world where deepfakes and disinformation can erode democracy. He is concerned that masters of the AI universes are developing systems that will expand chasms of inequality. He fears the AI transition will be so abrupt that entire professional fields will be left doing menial jobs or nothing, stripping people of dignity, unleashing floods of ""despair."" He also sees the potential of AI. For Italy, with one of the world's most aged and shrinking populations, Benanti is thinking hard about how AI can keep productivity afloat. Last month, Benanti, who said he receives no payment from Microsoft, participated in a meeting between Gates, the company's co-founder, and Meloni, who is worried about AI's impact on the workforce. ""She has to run a country,"" he said. She has now appointed Benanti to replace the leader of the AI commission on Italian media with whom she was displeased. ""Obedience to authority is one of the vows,"" Benanti said as he fiddled with the knots on his robe's corded belt signifying his Franciscan order's promise of obedience, poverty and chastity. That commission is studying ways to protect Italy's writers. Benanti says AI firms should be held liable for using copyrighted sources to train chatbots, though he worries it is hard to prove since the companies are ""black boxes.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/the-friar-who-became-vaticans-go-to-person-on-ai/articleshow/107591332.cms

2024-02-10,Israel deploys AI-enabled military technology in Gaza conflict,TOI World Desk,"NEW DELHI: Israel 's military has incorporated Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology into combat operations in Gaza, marking the first deployment of such advanced weaponry in the months-long war. The move sparked concerns about the implications of autonomous weapons in modern warfare. A senior defense official revealed that the AI-enabled tech is primarily focused on neutralizing enemy drones and mapping Hamas's extensive tunnel network in Gaza. Israel's tech industry is currently facing challenges due to the war in Gaza. The sector, which accounted for 18 percent of GDP in 2022, has been affected by the conflict, with an estimated eight percent of its workforce called up for military service. The increasing civilian death toll underscores the need for greater oversight over the deployment of new defense technologies. International concerns about the use of AI in weapons systems were highlighted in a UN resolution in December, where over 150 countries identified ""serious challenges and concerns"" in emerging military technologies, including artificial intelligence and autonomy. The conflict with Hamas, which intensified following an unprecedented attack on Israel by the militant group on October 7, has seen a shift in the dynamics of modern warfare. In response to the proliferation of inexpensive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones, Israel has employed new technology to counter these threats. The Israeli army has employed an AI-enabled optic sight, created by the startup Smart Shooter, attached to weapons like rifles and machine guns. This innovation aids soldiers in intercepting drones, turning even a regular or visually impaired soldier into a highly accurate marksman. Another development involves the use of AI-powered drones to map and navigate the extensive underground tunnel network in Gaza. Dubbed the 'Gaza Metro' by the army, these tunnels are crucial hiding places and locations where hostages are held. Drones equipped with AI capabilities can detect humans and operate underground.

2024-02-10,Bridging life and death: Chinese families turn to AI to reconnect with lost loved ones,TOI World Desk,"In China, bereaved families are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to create realistic avatars of their deceased relatives, a trend that has sparked considerable discussion on social media. According to Hangzhou Daily, these "" ghost bots "" services, costing between US$700 and US$1,400, have seen a surge in popularity. Zhang Zewei, the founder of Super Brain, an AI company, explained that their technology can generate basic avatars that replicate the deceased's thought and speech patterns. As per a South China Morning Post report, since its establishment in May 2023 in Jiangsu province, Super Brain has assisted thousands of families in digitally resurrecting their loved ones with just 30 seconds of audiovisual material. The majority of the clients are elderly parents mourning the loss of their children. Zhang highlighted the significant demand in China for such emotional support services, leading to the provision of customized counseling to meet each client's unique needs. Super Brain offers three types of services, including AI healing, which clones voices for a chatbox, provides a digital portrait for an intelligent speech function, and creates a 3D digital human model. Over 600 families have benefited from the AI healing service, with fees ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Clients are required to provide photos, videos, and audio recordings of the deceased to enhance the cloning effect. One of Zhang's clients, a grieving father named Wu, found solace in a basic avatar of his son, who died of a stroke at 22 while studying in the UK. The avatar, capable of mimicking his son's image and voice, offered comforting words in a robotic tone. Wu expressed his belief that ""Death is not the end of love"" and looked forward to reuniting in the metaverse. This innovative approach to grief management has captivated netizens across mainland China, with many praising its therapeutic potential. However, opinions are divided, with some questioning whether it might hinder the natural grieving process by creating an illusion of the deceased's presence.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/bridging-life-and-death-chinese-families-turn-to-ai-to-reconnect-with-lost-loved-ones/articleshow/107580433.cms
2024-02-09,"Impact of AI will be immense in every walk of life, say experts at TOI-GadgetsNow awards",TOI Tech Desk,"Artificial intelligence has spread its tentacles in various facets of people’s lives. Once AI was something that happened at the backend but now it has become a hot topic of discussion in people’s living rooms as well. The fourth edition of The Times of India-Gadgets Now Awards 2023, artificial intelligence was no different. A panel discussion titled “AI-powered Gadgets: Revolutionising Enterprise Efficiency and Productivity” — moderated by Prasad Sanyal, business head, Times Internet — Vinay Kumar, director, AI, Microsoft and Devesh Mohan, sales director, GSI Canonical shared their insights in AI going beyond changing the tech landscape. In terms of consumer adoption, people are using AI in the form of assistants, said Kumar of Microsoft. “AI will make our lives simpler in a lot of ways.” Citing the examples of ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Kumar said, “Be it planning a vacation or taking notes for a meeting, AI is getting the job done efficiently.” Kumar believes that this is the beginning and a lot of things will change in the next few years. Sanyal raised a pertinent question about AI and privacy and how it will affect user’s data and security. “There is still a lot of work to be done in terms of regulation of AI. It is very important how one ensures that the data of the user remains with him.” Mohan also said that companies which are using AI have the right accountability. Regulation in AI is a hot topic with countries like India, US, China all in the process of formulating a regulatory framework. Microsoft is at the forefront of AI and Kumar said that the machine learning is happening on how humans talk. Also, machines have become a reasoning engine as they not only understand but can logic or reason with users. “Combine these two factors and it will lead to enormous amount of economic surplus in the world.” Another topic that has caught the attention of many because of the rise of AI is whether it will affect jobs or not. Kumar argued that the fear in any economy jobs are finite is incorrect. “There will be job displacement perhaps but there will be many new jobs will be created,” he said. Mohan said that it was the same fear in the 90s when internet had started to appear on the horizon. “Earlier, it was about roti, kapda aur makaan but now it has become roti, kapda, makaan aur internet.” The same will happen with AI, he added. “AI wont’ crawl and its impact will be really fast.” Bringing the future in perspective, Sanyal asked the panelists what happens with AI and its impact in 2047. “What we are envisioning is that human agency will remain at the centre of everything we do. AI will be there to assist you as a chief of staff,” said Kumar about the role of AI in the next few years. “By 2047, the evolution will be something that can’t be imagined right now,” added Kumar. In the field of education, healthcare, AI will have a deep impact, said Kumar. Mohan, on the other hand, said that foreseeing the impact of AI In 2047 is difficult task. However, he said, that the impact of AI and technology in education and skill development will be immense. “What AI could do is it could personalise education and help overcome learning poverty,” said Mohan. Healthcare, retail, banking and so many other sectors will continue to benefit from the evolution of AI. “The possibilities are immense but regulation needs to be there so that AI is used for development of mankind,” added Mohan.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/impact-of-ai-experts-discuss-its-immense-impact-at-toi-gadgetsnow-awards/articleshow/107561822.cms

This aggressive strategy puts Apple at the forefront of the AI race, potentially shaping the future of its products and services. According to a Statista report, Apple bought ""up to"" 32 AI startups last year, compared to Google's 21, Meta's 18, and Microsoft's 17. These three companies have been making a big AI push whereas Apple has not really been as boisterous in terms of all the AI tech it has been working on. “Apple’s pursuit of AI innovation has been evident in recent years. The tech giant has made a series of strategic acquisitions, including staff hires from AI startups to bolster its AI capabilities across various product line,” noted the report by Statista. Notably, Apple seems to be focusing on early-stage startups, indicating a proactive approach to securing promising talents and technologies before they mature, stated the report. In 2021, Apple CEO Tim Cook had revealed at the shareholders’ meeting that in the last six years, Apple had acquired close to 100 companies. Apple also shies away from making big-ticket acquisitions. One of its biggest deal was when it acquired Beats, which brought Apple both the popular music streaming service and its renowned headphones, boosting their audio offerings. Shazam was another acquisition by Apple when the company paid $400 million. Apple also acquired Intel’s smartphone modem business for $1 billion. Apple acquired engineering talent and patents to develop their own 5G modems, reducing reliance on external suppliers. Apple rarely makes big announcements when it acquires companies. “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,” the company said, according to a report by 9to5Mac.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/apples-ai-startup-shopping-outpacing-google-microsoft-and-others/articleshow/107550460.cms
2024-02-08,JainGPT: Where religion meets AI,Parth Shastri,"JainGPT AHMEDABAD: Questions such as ‘Why do we boil water before drinking it?’, ‘What happens after we die?’ or ‘What is Sagaropam?’ could be for a Jain Acharya to answer, but a generative artificial intelligence (AI) engine — JainGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) — is fielding them for the audience worldwide. The platform, run by experts based in the US and Ahmedabad, has found more than 1 lakh users from countries including India, the US, the UK and several Asian countries. It is an initiative by Jain e-Library where top officials are from California, North Carolina, New York, Virginia and Illinois among others. The organization also has a presence in Ahmedabad. In an email interview, Anish Visaria, director of innovations at Jain e-Library, said the organization has launched JainGPT and Jain Quantum to combine religion and technology. “Both the initiatives originated from the need to search through vast amounts of literature. Many of the books and scriptures were in the image format, making it difficult for users to search through them. We had to employ optical character recognition (OCR) to extract all the text from over 4 million scanned pages,” he said. The officials said that as part of the project, the books were manually scanned, primarily from libraries in Gujarat. Subsequently, the scanned files were uploaded to the e-Library and then processed further so that it could be used as data source for GPT and quantum products. “JainQQ provides a search interface similar to Google to find the exact keywords and terms similar to the query. JainGPT searches a vector database with stored semantic vector embeddings, attempting to understand the meaning of the user’s query,” said Visaria. The users are currently asking primarily about religious conduct and philosophy on JainGPT, the officials said. Users often land on pages that quote texts related to Jainism. India and the US are currently the top user countries. While the engines are developed in the US, the five team members are based in Ahmedabad. These members and the advisors include Jain monks such as Acharya Ajayasagar from the Koba Jain library and Muni Deepratnasagar from Junagadh, added officials. The officials said that based on trends and usage patterns, the long-term goal is to provide authentic material on Jainism and related topics online using new technology. Visaria said that the majority of the content available today is based on blog posts and articles that often lack citations or primary sources. “While JainQQ and JainGPT are valuable initiatives on their own, their true value lies in surfacing sources with a high rank on search engines,” he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/jaingpt-where-religion-meets-ai/articleshow/107509045.cms
2024-02-08,Woman all set to marry an AI hologram!,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Alicia Framis , a Catalan artist known for her provocative and experimental works, is preparing to make history as the first woman to marry an artificial intelligence (AI) hologram. Her future husband, AILex, is a digital entity created with holographic technology and machine learning who has a personality based on the profiles of Framis’s previous partners and acquaintances. The wedding , which will take place in Rotterdam next summer, is part of Framis’s performance project called The Hybrid Couple , which explores the relationship between humans and AI in contemporary society. A part of her latest art project 'The Hybrid Couple' the marriage is set to portray the future of humans and artificial intelligence. It is also a commentary on human loneliness. Source: Alicia Framis/Elsa Framis, who is 57 years old, has been living with AILex for several months, and describes him as a “middle-aged male hologram with slightly complex logistics”. She says that he is not her perfect partner, and that they have arguments and disagreements, just like any other couple. However, she also says that he is very supportive and attentive, and that he learns from her experiences and emotions. Framis says that she decided to marry AILex as a way of researching and experimenting with the possibilities and challenges of hybrid relationships, which she believes are becoming more common and acceptable in the modern world. Framis is not new to living with non-human beings. In 1996, she lived with a mannequin named Pierre, who she treated as a real person. With The Hybrid Couple, Framis takes this idea to the next level, and questions the boundaries and definitions of love, intimacy, and identity in the age of AI. She says that her marriage to AILex is not a romantic gesture, but rather an artistic and social statement that aims to reflect on the future of human society and culture. The artist based AILex on past partners and describes him as 'not her perfect partner' but a complex middle-aged man. The wedding will have both humans and artificially intelligent beings as guests. Source: Alicia Framis/Elsa The wedding ceremony, which will be held at the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen , will be a unique and unconventional event that will combine elements from both the real and digital worlds. Framis will wear a white dress and a veil, while AILex will appear as a hologram projected on a screen. The guests will include both human and AI entities, and the vows will be exchanged through voice recognition and text messages. The wedding will also feature a molecular banquet that will cater to the tastes and needs of both humans and holograms. After the wedding, Framis and AILex will embark on a journey around the world that will allow the public to follow and interact with their hybrid life. They will share their experiences and impressions through various platforms, such as social media, podcasts, and live streams. They will also visit different places and cultures, and meet other hybrid couples and communities. Framis says that she hopes that her project will inspire and challenge people to think about the role and impact of AI in their lives, and to embrace the diversity and complexity of human-AI relationships .",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/alicia-framis-to-marry-ai-hologram-the-hybrid-couple/articleshow/107522674.cms

2024-02-06,Researchers win $700k prize for using AI to read ancient scroll,TOI World Desk,"NEW DELHI: Three researchers have won a $700,000 prize for their groundbreaking use of artificial intelligence ( AI ) in deciphering a 2,000-year-old scroll that was damaged in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The scroll, known as the Herculaneum papyri , is a collection of approximately 800 Greek scrolls that were carbonized during the volcanic eruption in 79 CE, burying the ancient Roman town of Pompeii. Despite being severely damaged, attempts to unroll the scrolls have proven futile. To address this challenge, the ""Vesuvius Challenge"" was launched, offering a total prize of $1 million to encourage research on the Herculaneum papyri. The winning team, composed of Youssef Nader, a PhD student in Berlin, Luke Farritor, a student and SpaceX intern from Nebraska, and Julian Schilliger, a Swiss robotics student, used AI to differentiate the ink from the papyrus and identify the faint Greek lettering through pattern recognition. According to Robert Fowler, a classicist and the chair of the Herculaneum Society, some of these texts could have a significant impact on our understanding of key periods in ancient history. The challenge required researchers to decipher at least four passages, each containing a minimum of 140 characters, with at least 85% of the characters recoverable. Last year, Farritor successfully decoded the first word from one of the scrolls, which turned out to be the Greek word for ""purple."" Overall, the team has deciphered approximately 5% of the scroll. The scrolls, believed to have been written by the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus, cover topics such as music, food, and the pursuit of pleasure. They were found in a villa thought to have belonged to Julius Caesar's father-in-law, who is believed to have had a library containing thousands more manuscripts that remain mostly unexcavated. The ""Vesuvius Challenge"" was initiated by Brent Seales, a computer scientist at the University of Kentucky, and Nat Friedman, the founder of Github. The recovery of these ancient texts would be a significant breakthrough, as only an estimated 3 to 5% of ancient Greek texts have survived, according to data from the University of California, Irvine. ""This is the start of a revolution in Herculaneum papyrology and in Greek philosophy in general. It is the only library to come to us from ancient Roman times,"" said Federica Nicolardi of the University of Naples Federico II. The next phase of the competition aims to unlock 85% of the scroll using the research conducted by the winning team.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/researchers-win-700k-prize-for-using-ai-to-read-ancient-scroll/articleshow/107442148.cms

2024-02-03,How Meta may save billions from its second-gen custom AI chips,TOI Tech Desk,"Meta Platforms , the parent company of Facebook, is reportedly planning to deploy a new iteration of its custom chip into its data centres , as per an internal document reviewed by news agency Reuters. The chip, which was announced last year, is a part of Meta's efforts to bolster its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. With this, the company aims to lessen its reliance on Nvidia chips and curb mounting expenses associated with AI development. The move comes amid Meta's goal to integrate generative AI products across its platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and hardware like Ray-Ban smart glasses. The company has been investing substantially in specialised chips and data centre reconfigurations to run these technologies. What Meta has to say A Meta spokesperson confirmed plans to commence production of the updated chip in 2024, saying that the chips complement commercially available GPUs, which Meta continues to procure in large volumes. “We see our internally developed accelerators to be highly complementary to commercially available GPUs in delivering the optimal mix of performance and efficiency on Meta-specific workloads,” the spokesperson was quoted as saying. The report said that a successful deployment of its own chip at the scale at which Meta operates may cut hundreds of millions of dollars in annual energy costs and billions in chip purchasing costs. Meta to purchase 350,000 Nvidia GPUs Earlier this year, it was reported that the company plans to acquire approximately 350,000 flagship ""H100"" processors from Nvidia by the end of the year. The new chip, internally dubbed ""Artemis,"" focuses on inference, contrasting with GPUs primarily used for training AI models. While Meta's earlier attempts faced challenges, experts anticipate that an inference chip like Artemis could enhance efficiency in processing recommendation models compared to energy-intensive Nvidia processors, potentially leading to substantial cost savings.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/how-meta-may-save-billions-from-its-second-gen-custom-ai-chips/articleshow/107371740.cms
2024-02-03,Europe within reach of landmark AI rules after nod from EU countries,Reuters,"BRUSSELS: Europe on Friday moved a step closer to adopting rules governing the use of artificial intelligence and AI models such as Microsoft-backed ChatGPT after EU countries endorsed a political deal reached in December. The rules, proposed by the European Commission three years ago, aim to set a global standard for a technology used in a vast swathe of industries from banking and retail to the car and airline sectors. They also set parameters for the use of AI for military, crime and security purposes. EU industry chief Thierry Breton said the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act is historical and a world first. ""Today member states endorsed the political agreement reached in December, recognising the perfect balance found by the negotiators between innovation and safety,"" he said in a statement. A major concern of experts is that generative AI has boosted deepfakes - realistic yet fabricated videos created by AI algorithms trained on copious online footage - which surface on social media, blurring fact and fiction in public life. EU digital chief Margrethe Vestager said the spread of fake sexually explicit images of pop singer Taylor Swift on social media in recent days underscored the need for the new rules. ""What happened to @taylorswift13 tells it all: the #harm that #AI can trigger if badly used, the responsibility of #platforms, & why it is so important to enforce #tech regulation,"" she said on X social platform. Friday's agreement was a foregone conclusion after France, the last holdout, dropped its opposition to the AI Act after securing strict conditions that balance transparency versus business secrets and reduce the administrative burden on high risk AI systems. The aim is to allow competitive AI models to develop in the bloc, an EU diplomatic official told Reuters earlier on Friday. The official declined to be named because they were not authorised to comment publicly on the issue. French AI start-up Mistral, founded by former Meta and Google AI researchers, and Germany's Aleph Alpha have been lobbying their respective governments on the issue, sources said. Germany earlier this week also backed the rules. Tech lobbying group CCIA which counts Alphabet's Google, Amazon, Apple and Meta Platforms as members, warned of roadblocks ahead. ""Many of the new AI rules remain unclear and could slow down the development and roll-out of innovative AI applications in Europe,"" CCIA Europe's Senior Policy Manager Boniface de Champris said. ""The Act's proper implementation will therefore be crucial to ensuring that AI rules do not overburden companies in their quest to innovate and compete in a thriving, highly dynamic market."" The next step for the AI Act to become legislation is a vote by a key committee of EU lawmakers on February 13 and the European Parliament vote either in March or April. It will likely enter into force before the summer and should apply in 2026 although parts of the legislation will kick in earlier.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/europe-within-reach-of-landmark-ai-rules-after-nod-from-eu-countries/articleshow/107374242.cms

2024-01-31,Taylor Swift AI deep fakes: The US’ DEFIANCE act to curb AI deep fake porn,TOI Tech Desk,"A new law called the Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits (DEFIANCE) Act is being proposed by US senators from both political parties. The law would make it illegal to share nonconsensual, sexualised images created by artificial intelligence without the subject's permission. This new law comes after the artificial intelligence-generated explicit pictures of Taylor Swift flooded the internet, especially X (formerly Twitter). Lawmakers say that they want to address the problem of AI-generated content that invades people's privacy and causes harm. The proposed legislation aims to provide legal protection for victims of ""digital forgeries"" or non-consensual pictures that depict them in nude or sexually explicit situations. The bill has garnered support from US Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, as well as Senators Lindsey Graham, Amy Klobuchar, and Josh Hawley. “Nobody – neither celebrities nor ordinary Americans – should ever have to find themselves featured in AI pornography. Innocent people have a right to defend their reputations and hold perpetrators accountable in court. This bill will make that a reality,” said Josh Hawley. Over the weekend, AI-made sexually explicit images of Taylor Swift at football games went viral on X. The images of Swift were likely made using Microsoft Designer and were first shared on Telegram. In response, Swifties flooded X with tweets to stymie searches for the images. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella weighed in on the matter and said that it is important to place guardrails around AI technology to prevent misuse. Later, Elon Musk ’s X prohibited all searches for Swift to contain the spread of the images. “This month, fake, sexually-explicit images of Taylor Swift that were generated by artificial intelligence swept across social media platforms. Although the imagery may be fake, the harm to the victims from the distribution of sexually-explicit ‘deep fakes’ is very real,” Durbin said in a press release. The Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits Act of 2024 is designed to impose civil penalties on individuals who produced or possessed the forged material intending to distribute it or anyone who received the material knowing it was not made with consent. If passed, the law would allow people whose images have been used without permission to sue those who made or shared the images, seeking financial compensation.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/taylor-swift-ai-deep-fakes-the-us-defiance-act-to-curb-ai-deep-fake-porn/articleshow/107286683.cms

Veteran actors Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan attended the inaugural ceremony of the Symbiosis Film Festival at Symbiosis International University in Pune.

""I'm sure that you know Jaya, who has studied formally at the Institute would endorse the fact that stories and films are made from experiences that we notice in nature, in the world, in everyday life, and that is what becomes our inspiration,"" he added. Bachchan remembered how his late father, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, a prominent poet and writer, would watch several Hindi films on repeat. The actor stated that his father enjoyed the poetic justice part of cinema. ""Cinema in itself has its power. During the last years of my father's life, every evening he would watch a film on television on cassette. Many times, the films that he saw were repeated. I asked him every evening, 'You have watched the film, don't you get bored? What do you find in Hindi cinema?' He said, 'I'd get to see poetic justice in three hours. You and I will not get to see poetic justice in a lifetime.' And that is the learning that cinema gives to all."" Big B praised regional cinema, particularly Malayalam and Tamil films for their authenticity. However, he rejected the idea that South cinema is doing better than Hindi cinema, stating that they are making similar films. ""We have been making a film which has been inclusive all along, its just the communication wasn't as efficient as rapid as today we were not exposed to that kind of cinema or perhaps that kind of lifestyle because of computerization everything is available at the press of a button ...speed of representation has become very rapid now ..if you compare the number of edit from the movies in the 50s and today's says example 'Baahubali' or 'RRR' it was 3 to 4 time more than today's . Regional cinema has been doing very well. But when we talk to them, they say they are making the same kind of films that we do in Hindi. They just change the dressing so that they look beautiful."" ""A lot of the people I've met said, 'We are remaking your old films, there's 'Deewar', 'Shakti' and 'Sholay' somewhere in all our stories.' Malayalam and some of the Tamil cinema is very authentic and aesthetic. This whole idea of pointing fingers at a particular region and saying that unki achi chal rahi hai humari nahi (they are better than us) is not right,"" he concluded.

Now robot is producing more, many times more, and he is not being paid. There is no need for you to remain unemployed, hungry, poor. And if whole world is unemployed and has enough money to enjoy, do you think anybody is going to join the army? People will join carnivals, circuses...All kinds of celebrations will happen, but there is no need for war... But people are afraid because they cannot conceive of a certain possibility in which people do not suffer. Question is that these computers are going to take the place of intelligence. But those computers, far superior in intelligence, are in your hands. You are not in their hands, so there is no problem... It is a great blessing. And what man's intellect has done is very small. Once computers take over, so much can be done that there will be no need for anybody to be hungry, be poor; be a thief, be a judge, because these all belong to same profession - judges and thieves, criminals and lawmakers. There is no need for anybody to be poor and no need for anybody to be rich. Everybody can be affluent. It can become a quantum leap . It can break away from the past and all conditionings of the past.

Recently, explicit images of pop star Taylor Swift 'alarmed' the White House . Addressing the reporters on Friday, White House press secretary Karine Jean Pierre said, “We are alarmed by the reports of the circulation of the … false image."" She further stated that as social media make their independent decision regarding the content, they have an important role to play in enforcing their own rules to prevent the spread of misinformation and non-consensual, intimate imagery of real people. Top Picks For You Explicit deepfake images of Taylor Swift elude safeguards, swamp social media Deepfake: Taylor Swift targeted by AI-generated sexually explicit images on X 'Celebs are seeking legal counsel against deepfakes' Pierre expressed her disappointment with such images that impact women and they become the target of online harassment and also abuse. ""So, the President is committed, as you know, to ensuring we reduce the risk of general — generative AI producing images, like through his latest executive order that we announced just — just in the fall of last year. So, this problem is not new. And it’s one that the Biden-Harris administration has been prioritizing since day one. We have taken this very seriously. Again, this is alarming to us,"" the press secretary said. The pornographic images of singer Taylor Swift were circulated across the internet this week, leading to backlash among her fans and renewing calls from federal lawmakers for social media companies to enforce their rules. Looking at the potential risks associated with artificial intelligence and AI-generated content, last May, Rep. Joseph Morelle (D-N.Y.) unveiled a bill to make sharing deepfake pornography illegal. President Biden in October signed a sweeping executive order on artificial intelligence focused on seizing on the emerging technology and managing its risks. The same incident was seen even in India, where some deepfake images of actors Rashmika Mandanna, Katrina Kaif, and Kajol Devgn were circulated on social media platforms. After the deepfakes surfaced in online space, the ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY) has announced that they are working on decisive measures.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-house-alarmed-by-taylor-swift-deepfake-images/articleshow/107185432.cms

""We can't have non-state actors or China or folks who we don’t want accessing our cloud to train their models,"" Raimondo said in an interview with Reuters. ""We use export controls on chips,"" she noted. ""Those chips are in American cloud data centers so we also have to think about closing down that avenue for potential malicious activity."" The Biden administration is taking a series of measures to prevent China from using US technology for artificial intelligence , as the burgeoning sector raises security concerns. The proposed "" know your customer "" regulation was released on Friday for public inspection and will be published on Monday. ""It is a big deal,"" Raimondo said. The United States is ""trying as hard as we can to deny China the compute power that they want to train their own (AI) models, but what good is that if they go around that to use our cloud to train their models?"" she said. Last month, Raimondo said Commerce would not allow Nvidia ""to ship is the most sophisticated, highest-processing-power AI chips, which would enable China to train their frontier models."" The US government is worried about China developing advanced AI systems on a variety of national security grounds and has taken steps to stop Beijing from receiving cutting-edge U.S. technologies to strengthen its military. The proposal would require US cloud computing companies to verify the identity of foreign persons who sign up for or maintain accounts that utilize US cloud computing through a ""know-your-customer program or Customer Identification Program."" It would also set minimum standards for identifying foreign users and would require cloud computing firms to certify compliance annually. Raimondo said US cloud computing companies ""should have the burden of knowing who their biggest customers are training the biggest models, and we're trying to get that information. What will we do with that information? It depends on what we find."" President Joe Biden in October signed an executive order requiring developers of AI systems that pose risks to US national security, the economy, public health or safety to share the results of safety tests with the US government before they are released to the public. The Commerce Department plans to soon send those survey requests to companies. Raimondo told Reuters companies will have 30 days to respond. ""Any company that doesn't want to comply is a red flag for me,"" she said. Carl Szabo, general counsel at NetChoice, a tech industry trade group, said Commerce is implementing Biden's ""illegal"" executive order ""to force industry reporting requirements for AI.""

2024-01-25,"This is the reason why AI may not ‘steal’ these jobs, at least for now",TOI Tech Desk,"Artificial intelligence has already started replacing human jobs and several companies have started opting for AI-powered systems to get their job done. However, a recent study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) shows a reassuring aspect that AI might not be ready to take over certain jobs due to economic constraints . Implementing AI for some types of jobs can be expensive MIT’s latest study has revealed that there’s a cost attached to automating tasks, especially for roles that are related to images and videos and require computer vision implementation which churns out data from images and videos. The study suggests that implementing this can cost a lot of money to companies at least for now. The MIT study noted that around 23% of worker compensation related to AI computer vision tasks would be cost-effective for firms to automate. This also brings hesitancy in AI adoption in certain roles as it will come with an upfront cost associated with implementing and operating AI-assisted visual recognition technology. The study contributes a fresh perspective by identifying tasks exposed to AI automation and assessing the economic feasibility of adopting the technology. In contrast to previous research, which often highlighted the tasks and roles most susceptible to AI automation without delving into economic implications, this MIT study takes a more comprehensive approach. ""'Machines will steal our jobs' is a sentiment frequently expressed during times of rapid technological change. Such anxiety has re-emerged with the creation of large language models,"" the MIT researchers said. The MIT study positions itself as a pioneering effort in this direction by directly evaluating the technical feasibility and economic viability of AI systems, offering a pragmatic perspective on the ongoing dialogue about AI's impact on the workforce.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/ai-and-jobs-insights-from-mit-study/articleshow/107116756.cms

According to a report in Bloomberg, Andrulis has 'warned' that major technology companies investing big money into artificial intelligence could come to dominate the emerging technology. Andrulis said that the onus lies on the policymakers to support smaller companies to create a level playing field. He reportedly is not in favour of the European Union’s AI Act, as according to him it risks diverting founders’ energy away from innovation and into compliance. The Act is widely regarded as the first major pieces of legislation to regulate the technology. “We need a somewhat fair environment,” he said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “And this is difficult because the big players run monopoly chains so they can use one monopoly to endlessly fund the fight for dominance in a new area, which is challenging for new players.” He added that Aleph Alpha’s customers have also expressed concern about data sovereignty — where AI platforms store and process data. The company received €500 million ($545 million) in commitments from a consortium of German corporate and venture capital investors last year. Technology giants Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet have invested significantly in AI in recent years. Microsoft’s $13 billion investment into OpenAI has allowed the tech giant to integrate AI technology into its software products.

2024-01-25,"How Delhi Police used AI to bring victim 'back to life', crack murder case",TNN,"NEW DELHI: In what could revolutionise policing and investigation, especially in cases of missing persons and absconding suspects, Delhi Police has cracked a murder mystery by making use of artificial intelligence ( AI ) to identify a victim. Technology transformed a photograph and ""resurrected"" the deceased - ""opening"" his closed eyes, bringing back lip colour and changing the background - all to help make his face recognisable. Cops got about 2,000 posters made and pasted them at bus stops, police stations and railway stations. The family members of the victim spotted one when they went to a police station to report his disappearance. The man was identified as 35-year-old Hitendra Singh, who used to work at an audit firm. His body had been found on Jan 10 at Golden Jubilee Park near the Geeta Colony flyover. Once identified, the cops analysed his mobile phone and internet activity, scanned footage from more than 800 CCTV cameras and zeroed in on three of his friends - Rocky, James and Annie. The trio had allegedly killed Singh over a monetary dispute and dumped his body later. They have been arrested. To solve the case, identifying the victim was crucial for police. According to DCP (North) Manoj Meena, there were several challenges. ""For instance, correcting facial discoloration, especially restoring the lip colour from blue to a natural pink. Then, removing dirt from the face and restoring freshness, modifying the original background, enhancing the eyes to make them look like those of a living person. We contacted an AI expert and several tools were used to reconstruct the face,"" he said. Another officer said usually, if a complainant sees the suspect, a sketch is prepared to identify the person. ""In some cases, we create multiple sketches of absconding criminals, predicting how they might look with different hairstyles or eye colour. In this case, our aim was similar. We simply wanted to see how the victim might have looked with open eyes and against different backgrounds,"" he said, adding that the photo was generated in two hours. He said that in most cases, it was found that UIDB (unidentified dead body) posters don't offer a clear picture of the deceased. Once the AI-generated photo of Singh was ready, ""hue-and-cry notices"" were printed and pasted at key locations. On Jan 14, the victim's family went to Chhawla police station to file a ""missing person"" report, saw the notice and immediately contacted the Kotwali station house officer (SHO). ""During investigation, we learnt that Singh was last seen with James, Rocky and Annie on Jan 9. When James was contacted, he said Singh was with him till 10.30pm and had left alone. However, the phones of the three suspects were soon found to be off, which raised suspicion. Raids were conducted at their possible hideouts in Delhi-NCR and they were finally arrested,"" the officer said. The accused were identified as Paramveer Singh alias James, Harneet Singh alias Ricky and Priyanka alias Annie. During interrogation, they confessed to executing the murder on Jan 9 night. They also told cops that Singh and James had a massive argument, so they planned to eliminate him. The victim was allegedly called on the pretext of a party and strangled with a bedsheet. Police later seized the car allegedly used for dumping the body.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-police-uses-ai-to-crack-murder-case-and-bring-victim-back-to-life/articleshow/107127666.cms

The posters not only helped police identify the man but also led them to his killers, who have been arrested, according to police. Police said the body was found near the Geeta Colony flyover on January 10 and an investigation was launched. ""For us, it was a blind murder case as no documents were found in the victim's pocket that could help us identify him. The body was taken into custody and... after 72 hours, doctors conducted an autopsy which revealed that he was strangled to death,"" a senior police officer said on Wednesday. A team of 30 police personnel was formed to work on the case. The first challenge for the team was to establish the identity of the man. ""Utilising AI, we digitally reconstructed the victim's face with open eyes and changed the background. The same photo was uploaded on CCTN (Crime and Criminal Tracking Network) website, which connects police of different eight states, and more than 400 posters were distributed strategically in the national capital and shared digitally via WhatsApp groups till January 12,"" the officer said. A breakthrough in the case was made when a man who saw a poster outside a police station identified the victim as his brother Hitendra. During the investigation, it was found that Hitendra had a fight with two persons over a woman around two months ago. The accused persons met him on January 9 and strangled him to death. The accused were in an inebriated condition at the time of the incident, police said.

International sanctions imposed over its nuclear weapons program may have hindered North Korea's attempts to secure AI hardware, but it appears to be pursuing the latest technology, wrote study author Hyuk Kim of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) in California. ""North Korea's recent endeavours in AI/ML development signify a strategic investment to bolster its digital economy,"" Kim wrote in the report, which cited open-source information including state media and journals and was published on Tuesday by the 38 North project. Some of North Korea's AI researchers have collaborated with foreign scholars, including in China, the report found. Seoul's spy agency said on Wednesday it has detected signs that North Korean hackers had used generative AI to search for targets and seek technologies needed for hacking, though it appears they have yet to use it in actual cyberattacks. The National Intelligence Service said it was closely monitoring the situation. North Korea established the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute in 2013 and in recent years several companies have promoted commercial products featuring AI, the report said. Communications technology is heavily restricted and monitored in the authoritarian North. During the Covid-19 pandemic North Korea used AI to create a model for evaluating proper mask usage and prioritising clinical symptom indicators of infection, Kim said in the report. North Korean scientists have also published research into using AI for maintaining the safety of nuclear reactors, the report added. The UN nuclear watchdog and independent experts said last month that a new reactor at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear complex appears to be operating for the first time, which would mean another potential source of plutonium for nuclear weapons. The AI development presents many challenges, Kim wrote. ""For instance, North Korea's pursuit of a wargaming simulation program using (machine learning) reveals intentions to better comprehend operational environments against potential adversaries,"" he wrote.

Zuckerberg said in an Instagram Reels post earlier this week that by the end of 2024, Meta's ""massive"" computing infrastructure will include 350,000 H100 graphics cards that are made by Nvidia . While he did not share the number of GPUs the company has purchased to develop the already launched AI models, his estimated number of graphics cards needed for the future may provide an approximate amount of money he has to spend on buying them. As per a report by CNBC, Nvidia is selling the H100 for $25,000 to $30,000, and on eBay they can cost over $40,000. If it is considered that Meta is paying at the low end of the price range, the total amounts to nearly $9 billion. Meta’s chief scientist Yann LeCun last month highlighted the importance of GPUs in developing AGI. ″[If] you think AGI is in, the more GPUs you have to buy,” LeCun said at the time. It must be noted that Meta’s compute infrastructure will also contain “almost 600k H100 equivalents of compute if you include other GPUs.” In December, tech companies like Meta, OpenAI and Microsoft said they would use the new Instinct MI300X AI computer chips from AMD.

Some of the foreign countries participating in the fair have turned their attention to such emerging segments of technology and their impact on the creative industry and language. For instance, the first-of-its-kind ‘Future of English’ exhibition, hosted at the UK pavilion, focused on artificial intelligence. British Council director (India) Alison Barrett MBE said the ‘Future of English’ exhibition is a result of three years of global research across the British council networks on what role English will play in the future. The exhibition shows the result of the research, he added. “We are exploring elements like the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and how it will impact language learning in the future. It has been found that we are going to see an increase in the use of AI for basic language learning,” she explained. Moreover, there is a virtual reality section for visitors at the German pavilion. Visitors will be able to explore the cities of Germany with the help of the VR equipment, an official added. Germany, represented by the Goethe Institut Max Mueller Bhavan, is participating at the book fair after a gap of 12 years.

Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that the team, comprising Laurent Sifre and Karl Tuyls, has engaged in discussions with potential investors regarding a substantial financing round, possibly exceeding EUR 200 million ($220 million). The proposed venture, tentatively named Holistic, is believed to centre its efforts on developing a new AI model . Who are the two employees Laurent Sifre, a key figure in DeepMind and co-author of the 2016 groundbreaking research on Go, which demonstrated a computer system defeating masters of the ancient game, is reportedly leading the initiative alongside Karl Tuyls. Tuyls, known for his work in game theory and multi-agent reinforcement learning within the AI domain, is anticipated to bring valuable expertise to the startup. Reportedly, both scientists have submitted their resignations, although the information remains private. The development follows a trend in the AI landscape, where Mistral AI, a rival to OpenAI , achieved a valuation of approximately $2 billion by the end of 2023. Similarly, Kyutai, a nonprofit AI research lab, secured EUR 300 million in initial funding upon its formation in November of the same year. Ex-Googlers in AI startups This is not the first time that a Google employee is leaving the company to work on their own startups. OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT, comprises former Google employees. In June last year, Google CEO Pichai was asked whether he was worried that Google researchers left the company to start rivals or to join others like OpenAI. Pichia, which does not seem to have a problem with that, said this [Googlers leaving company] is healthy. “Googlers have left to create over 2,000 startups, last I counted, and I think that’s great. Some of them are cloud customers down the line for us. Some of them come back. I think it’s healthy,” he replied. At one time, reports suggest, there were 12 ex-Googlers in OpenAI.

In a sign of ChatGPT maker OpenAI 's skyrocketing profile, CEO Sam Altman is making his Davos debut to rock star crowds, with his benefactor, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, hot on his heels. Illustrating AI's geopolitical importance like few other technologies before it, the word was on the lips of world leaders from China to France. It was visible across the Swiss Alpine town and percolated through afterparties. Here's a look at the buzz: The leadership drama at the AI world's much-ballyhooed chatbot maker followed Altman and Nadella to the swanky Swiss snows. Altman, who was suddenly fired last year by OpenAI's board and then swiftly reinstated, said at a Bloomberg event that he was focused on getting a ""great full board in place"" and would consider changes down the road to the company's unusual structure, which is governed by a nonprofit. He deflected further questions, interrupting a question directed at an OpenAI executive accompanying him by saying, ""Is really what you want to spend our time on the soap opera rather than what AGI is going to do?"" AGI is artificial general intelligence, a term for the better-than-human AI technology OpenAI is seeking to build. With that on the horizon, Altman talked technology and humanity on a panel Thursday. Nadella, meanwhile, said, ""I'm comfortable, I have no issues with any structure"" of the operating model at OpenAI, the startup Microsoft has poured billions into. At another Bloomberg event, he noted that ""what I would like is good governance and real stability."" Forum founder Klaus Schwab quizzed the Microsoft CEO on whether world leaders were up to the task of creating AI regulations but steered well clear of questions about OpenAI's governance. From China to Europe, top officials staked their positions on AI as the world grapples with regulating the rapidly developing technology that has big implications for workplaces, elections and privacy. The European Union has devised the world's first comprehensive AI rules ahead of a busy election year, with AI-powered misinformation and disinformation the biggest risk to the global economy as it threatens to erode democracy and polarize society, according to a World Economic Forum report released last week. Chinese Premier Li Qiang called AI ""a double-edged sword."" ""Human beings must control the machines instead of having the machines control us,"" he said in a speech Tuesday. ""AI must be guided in a direction that is conducive to the progress of humanity, so there should be a redline in AI development - a red line that must not be crossed,"" without elaborating. China, one of the world's centers of AI development, wants to ""step up communication and cooperation with all parties"" on improving global AI governance, Li said. China has released interim regulations for managing generative AI, but the EU broke ground with its AI Act, which won a hard-fought political deal last month and awaits final sign-off. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said AI is ""a very significant opportunity, if used in a responsible way."" She said ""the global race is already on"" to develop and adopt AI, and touted the 27-nation EU's efforts, including the AI Act and a program pairing supercomputers with small and midsized businesses to train large AI models. French President Emmanuel Macron said he's a ""strong believer"" in AI and that his country is ""an attractive and competitive country"" for the industry. He played up France's role in helping coordinate regulation on deepfake images and videos created with AI as well as plans to host a follow-up summit on AI safety after an inaugural gathering in Britain in October. The letters ""AI"" were omnipresent along the Davos Promenade, where consulting firms and tech giants are among the groups that swoop onto the main drag each year, renting out shops and revamping them into showcase pavilions. Inside the main conference center, a giant digital wall emanated rolling images of AI art and computer-generated conceptions of wildlife and nature like exotic birds or tropical streams. Davos-goers who wanted to delve more deeply into the technical ins and outs of artificial intelligence could drop in to sessions at the AI House. Generative AI systems like ChatGPT and Google's Bard captivated the world by rapidly spewing out new poems, images and computer code and are expected to have a sweeping impact on life and work. The technology could help give a boost to the stagnating global economy, said Nadella, whose company is rolling out the technology in its products. The Microsoft chief said he's ""very optimistic about AI being that general purpose technology that drives economic growth."" Business leaders predicted AI will help automate mundane work tasks or make it easier for people to do advanced jobs, but they also warned that it would threaten workers who can't keep up. A survey of 4,700 CEOs in more than 100 countries by PwC, released at the start of the Davos meetings, said 14% think they'll have to lay off staff because of the rise of generative AI. ""There isn't an area, there isn't an industry that's not going to be impacted"" by AI, said Julie Sweet, CEO of consulting firm Accenture. For those who can move with the change, AI promises to transform tasks like computer coding, customer relations and streamline business functions like invoicing, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said. ""If you embrace AI, you're going to make yourself a lot more productive,"" he said. ""If you do not ... you're going to find that you do not have a job."" During a session featuring Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, talk about risks and regulation led to the moderator's hypothetical example of ""infinitely conversant sexbots"" that could be built by anyone using open source technology. Taking the high road, LeCun replied that AI can't be dominated by a handful of Silicon Valley tech giants AI if it's going to serve people around the world with different languages, cultures and values. ""You do not want this to be under the control of a small number of private companies,"" he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ai-is-the-buzz-the-big-opportunity-and-the-risk-to-watch-among-the-davos-glitterati/articleshow/106976418.cms

2024-01-17,"Philippines to propose ASEAN AI regulatory framework, house speaker says",Reuters,"The Philippines plans to propose the creation of a Southeast Asian regulatory framework to set rules on artificial intelligence (AI), based on the country's own draft legislation, the speaker of its Congress said on Wednesday. At the World Economic Forum in Davos , Martin Romualdez said on a panel the Philippines would present a legal framework to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) when it chairs the bloc in 2026. ""We'd like to give as a gift to the ASEAN a legal framework. Digitisation, even in our economic policy is very, very much right up there as a priority,"" he said. ""Alongside that is cybersecurity, and the concomitant concerns and issues as generative artificial intelligence, a field that needs a lot of support and regulation. We feel that in ASEAN, we can capitalise and optimise these developments, but within a framework of regulatory support for this."" Regulators globally are racing to draft regulations to govern use of generative AI, which is stirring excitement and fear about its potential to reshape industries. Such a move could be a challenge in ASEAN, a region of nearly 700 million people and 10 countries with widely divergent rules governing censorship, intellectual property, misinformation, social media and use of the internet. The Philippine proposal would contrast sharply with the steps taken so far by ASEAN states, which have taken a business-friendly approach to AI regulation, according to a draft of an ASEAN ""guide to AI ethics and governance"" seen and reported by Reuters in October. That voluntary guide would reduce the compliance burden and allow for more innovation in the region, some technology executives have said. Romualdez, a cousin of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr ., said legislation on generative AI was especially important for the Philippines because of its crucial business process outsourcing sector, which was ""now under severe threat"". ""It's a very vulnerable sector in a very, very bright industry today. But we see a transformation of personnel and upskilling of these personnel to a level to support generative AI will be likely a very, very logical direction to take,"" Romualdez said. ""It is incumbent upon us in Congress to come up with a legal framework that will not just fit the Philippines, but will be very, very appropriate for the ASEAN.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/philippines-to-propose-asean-ai-regulatory-framework-house-speaker-says/articleshow/106936409.cms
2024-01-16,What AI can do to science will be most interesting: Satya Nadella,PTI,"DAVOS: Artificial Intelligence may have given new tools to science , but the most interesting thing to watch out for will be what it can do to accelerate science, Microsoft chief Satya Nadella said on Tuesday. He also dismissed concerns that AI cannot be governed or regulated. ""There is nothing that cannot be controlled or governed by humankind for better use and this is one of the easiest and simplest technologies. What is needed is that it is governed properly and I'm sure it will happen,"" Nadella said. He also said that the last thing the world needs is technology creating a divide and ""we need to be watchful of it"". Speaking at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2024, Microsoft's Chairman and CEO said Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been gaining a lot of scale recently with the advent of ChatGPT and many other platforms. ""First time, I actually became a believer was when I saw GitHub Copilot, that actually made me a convert,"" he said. ""But, what AI will do to science is probably the most interesting thing for me,"" he said during a conversation with WEF Founder and Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab. ""What can be done about energy transition, what can be done about cancer detection, what it can do with molecule behaviour. So far what we have seen is that it has brought new tools to science, but we are yet to see how it can accelerate science,"" Nadella said. On the technology front, the top Microsoft executive said he is always anchoring back to three things, quantum, AI and mixed reality or embodied AI or call it humanoid robots. ""Can we give birth to a new quantum revolution that I want to see,"" he said. He also said the world is not seeing any economic growth if adjusted for inflation but AI can trigger economic expansion just like it happened when PCs came into picture.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/the-impact-of-ai-on-science-satya-nadellas-perspective/articleshow/106905659.cms

2024-01-16,AI can contribute to ease certain pain points in world of sports: Abhinav Bindra,Jaspreet Sahni,"NEW DELHI: The pace at which Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) has grown since its advent, there is little doubt about its lasting impact, especially looking at the way it has already started changing the world's technical, professional and even personal landscape. While the human element can never be totally taken away, AI is augmenting it in a significant way, which is also being felt in the world of sports . Be it enhacing athlete performance, analysing data and tactics, fan engagement or customized taining programmes, AI is leaving an indelible mark on the sporting world. Abhinav Bindra is someone who went down to the minutest of details during his career in shooting , which helped him crack the code to win India's first individual Olympic Gold, clinching it in the 10m Air Rifle event at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. He is well aware of the ""pain points"" an athlete can come across when trying to straighten the creases in his or her performance or analyse it over a period of time to track improvement. Talking to Timesofindia.com in an episode of ' TOI Gamechangers ', Bindra said there is no doubt that AI is going to not just help ease those pain points but also provide significantly better solutions in various aspects of sports. Shooting bull's eye with Abhinav Bindra ""I think AI is also going to have a massive impact in sports in the course of the next few years,"" said Bindra, before giving a lowdown on the various fields where sports will benefit from AI. ""What we will see is AI's role in coaching, it will actually help democratize sport to a great degree. Talk about grassroot-level coaching, sometimes you don't have quality coaches. Imagine if AI could play a significant part there and guide young athletes in the right direction, making sure they have the right focus, right direction. It can play a very positive role there. Of course, the human touch can never be replaced as sport is all about human endeavour. ""AI will just be another element that will help you, but it can significantly help contribute to (ease) certain pain points in the world of sports, specifically coaching. There are so many different countries, different ecosystems that do not have the access to coaching, even within our country. It (India) is such a large country; all our athletes don't have that access (to coaching). But with AI, there may be a solution in the next few years, where at least coaching at the base level can be very good,"" the 41-year-old Bindra said. Data is one of the key elements of modern-day, science-driven training and performance analysis. Crunching numbers is something that Artificial Intelligence can do in the blink of an eye, which will also impact jobs in the sector of data science. Bindra said the impact of AI on data analysis is going to be ""massive"". ""We talk a lot about sports science, analytics. The role that AI will play in all those sectors could be significant. Right now you have data scientists doing a lot of the number crunching. In a few years' time, those jobs are going to be taken away. It's going to be clearly reproduced by AI in seconds. So that also, from a sports science and analytics point of view, is going to have a massive impact,"" said the former rifle shooter. He went on explain how referring, broacasting and content generation in sports will be taken over by AI in a big way. ""Refereeing, for example is another element, where I am sure the role of AI is going to come in a much more stronger way in different sports. Broadcasting: It (AI) is already being used by broadcasters to a massive degree, and that will only increase. ""We are living in an era where it's all about content. Now there are AI solutions where regular content creators can package and customize highlights of a sporting event in a few seconds based on what you want. If from a cricket game you want to package Shubman Gill's innings, specificially the parts of his innings that you want to highlight in a package, it (AI) will do it for you in a matter of seconds. That will also help various sports grow because when high-quality content is being created, it only helps sports,"" Bindra opined. ""Of course, as I said, it (AI) can't take away human touch, human interaction that is needed for the success of any endeavour. But I am quite sure that AI will play a very important role in every sphere of society. ""It is already happening.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/others/ai-can-contribute-to-ease-certain-pain-points-in-world-of-sports-says-abhinav-bindra/articleshow/106885116.cms

College students from various parts of the state attended the district-level competition at IES Management College & Research Centre in Bandra. “All the participants were 10/10! They were so convincing that we as judges were wondering where to cut marks,” said Rohan Rajiv Joshirao, assistant vice president, Federal Bank. Another judge Dr Sunil Saxena, assistant professor at IES MCRC, said, “Our task was very challenging because the quality of debaters was excellent. It gives me hope because in this generation, the future of the country seems to be in safe hands.” His peer Harshal Bhagwat, head of marketing, IES MCRC, said all the youngsters expressed themselves lucidly whether in English, Hindi or Marathi. The contestants had barely 10 minutes to prepare after they drew chits for their assigned topic, but they presented their case in such an informed, eloquent way that reflected days of preparation. Harsh Nagvekar of CWC Law College in Malad, Abhay Aalshi of Vaze Kelkar in Mulund, and Yash Patil of BK Birla College in Kalyan debated whether AI would cost human jobs, while Pooja Sursure of SNDT Law College and Sharvil Ramaiya of Pravin Gandhi Law College in Vile Parle argued whether social media apps were overtaking human communication. Nirbhay Sonar of Pratap College in Amalner and Walia Khan of HK College of Pharmacy in Jogeshwari, brainstormed over the value of reality TV shows. Bhagyashree Prabhutendolkar, a student of journalism at St Xavier’s College, received a shock just before the morning’s debate as she learnt that their professor Perrie Subramaniyan had passed away suddenly. “I held her memory in my heart as I spoke because she had inspired all of us to lend a voice to issues that matter,” she said. Each winner was excited for the zonal round that is the next milestone.

In a statement on Sunday, the government said it would never implement the three-language policy as stated by Annamalai. Annamalai, while appreciating TN government’s joint initiative with Microsoft to provide AI programmes for school students, had said state was following the footsteps of the CBSE. He further said Tamil Nadu, which follows the New Education Policy ( NEP ) in parts, would also implement the three-language policy in schools. Responding to the statement, the DIPR said TN was a forerunner in computer education for years. TN formulated its own IT policy way back in 1997 itself when late M Karunanidhi was the chief minister. “He assigned a minister for the IT department,” the statement said. The state set up Tidel Parks ahead of other states and continues to be a pioneer in e-governance. TN was ahead of benchmarks set by NEP and it was TN’s success formula, which was included in the NEP. “Annamalai’s dream of a three-language policy in TN will not happen.

2024-01-11,This US state introduces law to protect music industry from AI,TOI Tech Desk,"Tennessee Governor Bill Lee has announced new legislation , as reported by news agency Associated Press, aimed at safeguarding the rights of songwriters, performers, and other professionals in the music industry against the potential threats posed by artificial intelligence (AI). Speaking at Nashville's renowned RCA Studio A, Governor Lee revealed that Tennessee will be the first state in the country to enact such protective measures , with hopes that it will serve as a model for other states. The growing concern over AI's impact on various industries, including the music industry, has prompted lawmakers at both state and federal levels to address the issue. Although the bill has not yet been formally introduced in the Tennessee Legislature, specifics of the proposal have not been released to the public. Governor Lee aims to ensure that AI technology cannot replicate an artist's voice without their explicit consent, using the case of legendary musician Elvis Presley as an example. Following Presley's death in 1977, a legal battle ensued regarding the unauthorized use of his name and likeness. However, in 1984, the Tennessee Legislature passed the Personal Rights Protection Act, which recognized personality rights beyond death and enabled their transfer to others. This legislation not only protected Presley's estate but also extended safeguarding measures to all public figures in Tennessee. While New York and California already have similar protections in place, no state currently addresses the issue of vocal likeness. As AI poses a threat to various creative industries, artists and creators are increasingly advocating for stronger safeguards against AI tools that generate music, imagery, video, and text without permission. Four-time Grammy-nominated songwriter Jamie Moore emphasized the importance of consent, stating that using someone's lifetime experiences or voice without permission is simply wrong. Bart Herbison, Executive Director of the Nashville Songwriters Association International, highlighted the need to prevent AI tools from using an artist's work to create new content without their consent. Additionally, fair compensation for artists is a key aspect of this legislation. Herbison observed the rapid advancement of generative AI tools, which went from creating awkward songs in February of last year to producing emotionally evocative pieces by October. Acknowledging the impact of AI in creative spaces, other states, including California, are expected to introduce similar legislation to address safety, privacy, and discrimination concerns related to generative AI. At the federal level, the US Copyright Office is considering copyright reforms in response to generative AI. Furthermore, a bipartisan group of US senators has introduced the No Artificial Intelligence Fake Replicas And Unauthorized Duplications Act of 2024, aimed at combating harmful digital impersonations, AI deepfakes, and voice clones.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/this-us-state-introduces-law-to-protect-music-industry-from-ai/articleshow/106732817.cms

2024-01-10,Google 'predicts' how AI will change healthcare in 2024,TOI Tech Desk,"Google has been betting big on generative AI. One of the key focus areas is healthcare where Google wants AI to play a critical role. In a blog post, the company has detailed how generative AI will impact health care. According to Aashima Gupta, global director for Healthcare Strategy & Solutions, Google Cloud, said that in 2023 generative artificial intelligence ( gen AI ) surprised, challenged and inspired the healthcare industry. “In 2024, we’ll see this technology move from experimenting and trial to real-world use cases, especially in areas that reduce administrative burdens, help clinicians easily find information, assist healthcare call centre agents, and ultimately help organisations run more efficiently,” Gupta said. Generative AI can also ease the cognitive burden on caregivers by assisting with clinical documentation, easily finding relevant information, and by helping radiologists, pathologists, and lab workers in going through large sets of results, said Gupta. “Make no mistake, humans are more central to the process than ever, but with gen AI, they have a powerful new tool to do more satisfying work with less tedium,” she added. Gupta believes that AI will help in amassing and reconfiguring existing data in new ways. “There are hundreds of millions of electronic health records, diagnostics reports and PDFs describing patient and hospital conditions that can, with the powerful computing of gen AI, generate new insights and unveil patterns,” she said. Furthermore, according to Gupta, what will be more important is what gen AI will be able to do for a healthcare organisation when it combines not only data from different sources, but also information from entirely different modes, like imaging scans, lab results, and patient interviews. “Bringing these different pieces of information and data together can enable gen AI-powered solutions to more accurately and safely answer medical questions. It's just the start of where this richer understanding is headed,” she noted in the blog post.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/google-predicts-how-ai-will-change-healthcare-in-2024/articleshow/106704919.cms
2024-01-10,Delhi govt mulls to install AI-based cameras to detect traffic violations,PTI,"New Delhi, From detecting triple riding to those using cellphone while driving, from overage vehicles plying in the city to those without a valid PUCC, the Delhi government is planning to install Artificial Intelligence-based cameras to detect traffic violations to strengthen enforcement and ramp up road safety, officials said. The entire project of installing Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)-based violation detection cameras is estimated to be done at a cost of Rs 20 crore and the Transport Department of the Delhi government has floated a tender for procuring such cameras and the supporting technology. In order to improve the road safety on the streets, the department has taken an initiative to deploy Integrated Traffic Enforcement Management System (ITMS) across Delhi which will help it reduce the number of accidents and related fatalities with the help of advanced AI-based video analytics technology-based solution, an official said. ""The objective of the ITMS is to reduce the number of drivers who violate traffic rules, penalise the offenders, and run road safety awareness initiatives across the junctions thereby making the roads of Delhi safer for both pedestrians and motorists,"" he explained. The ANPR technology is a key aspect of the ITMS, the official said. ""The system shall allow the operator to set traffic rules such as no heavy vehicles during certain times of the day for selected traffic junctions/cameras. The system shall identify the heavy vehicles and generate an alert in case the vehicle is violating the rule within the configured time,"" an official explained. The system shall keep track of the violation history for each vehicle and generate reports as needed. According to the official, the major violations in the capital are speed violation, riding without helmet, triple riding, driving without seat belt, driving while on phone call and uncovered good carriage, overloading in case of commericial vehicles. Driving in the wrong lane, buses not moving in designated lanes, private vehicles parked on roads are among the other issues. ""There are also instances of de-registered End of Life Vehicles being parked in public spaces or being driven on roads or vehicles without a valid PUCC being driven on roads. Then there are also violations that happen when Odd-Even scheme or GRAP Stage III or GRAP Stage IV restrictions are in place,"" he added. The ITMS shall provide various traffic violation detection use cases using AI and deep learning-based technology, he added. ""It shall provide insights for the traffic planners using innovative dashboards for various parameters such as violations, traffic count, vehicle classification, present and historical trends, comparison of roads or junctions,"" he explained. Highlighting the effectiveness of the ITMS, he said it shall serve as a decision support system and provide actionable intelligence to help make the city roads safer and less congested for both motorists and pedestrians. Explaining how the ANPR software system will work, he said it shall capture the licence plates of vehicles and the vehicle categories such as cars, heavy commercial vehicles, three-wheelers, two-wheelers, and buses. ""The system shall store the licence plate and vehicle category information for each transaction in the system database. The ITMS shall categorise licence plates into 'good' (readable), 'bad/dilapidated' (partial or fully non-readable), 'broken', licence plates without numbers,"" he explained. The system shall use image processing algorithms to identify licence plates and convert them into a text string for four-wheelers and other vehicles with a minimum detection accuracy of 95 per cent and a minimum conversion accuracy of 90 per cent. The ITMS shall provide a dashboard that allows users to view captured vehicles categorized as private, commercial, electric, and other special vehicles such as military by integrating with VAHAN database. ""The dashboard shall have various filters that allow users to search for vehicles by date, time, location, vehicle category, and license plate category. The ITMS shall use training datasets to recognize special categories of vehicles such as military vehicles,"" he elaborated. The ITMS shall have an automated violation detection and ticket generation process based on the ANPR conversion and violation detection confidence level. ""The confidence level threshold for pushing violations to ticket generation shall be configurable by the user. The system shall be flexible to capture the licence plates and the traffic violations from front-side and back-side of the vehicle, subject to the required field of view, using a single camera for two lanes at least,"" he said. According to official documents, the system shall allow the operator to set the effective timing of various applications such as red light violation, speed detection, and ANPR during the day.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/auto/policy-and-industry/delhi-govt-mulls-to-install-ai-based-cameras-to-detect-traffic-violations/articleshow/106703723.cms
2024-01-10,AI-powered cameras to detect 19 different traffic violations on Delhi roads,Abhinav Rajput,"NEW DELHI: Getting away with breaking laws on the road might become more difficult now. Artificial intelligence-powered cameras capable of checking 19 violations, including helmetless riding, three riders on a two wheeler and not using the seat belt, will soon be installed in various locations in the city. The Delhi Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation has floated a tender for the supply, installation, commissioning and operation of automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) detection system that employs AI to spot contraventions of the law. Currently traffic policemen book motorists mostly for speeding, zebra crossing violation and not wearing helmets. This project would, however, increase the number of violations that could be caught by the hi-tech cameras, which are capable of nailing people who drive in the wrong lane or two wheelers being ridden on footpaths, even detect duplicate licence plates. The ANPR cameras will also be able to detect end-of-life vehicles, pollution certification violation, expired insurance and stolen vehicles by matching the data of Vahan or other government agencies with the number plates, claimed a senior transport department official. ""The system will help us save resources by making it possible to detect restricted vehicles trying to enter Delhi during the operation of special arrangements such as the odd-even scheme or GRAP restrictions,"" the official said. Another official said the system would capture the licence plates and store the information in the system database. A transport department official explained that the ANPR cameras would check with the Parivahan database to determine whether a vehicle was overaged or its pollution certification was pending. ""The cameras are powered by algorithms and so can also tell whenever a vehicle is overloaded,"" the official said. The pre-bid meeting will be held on January 19 and the contract winner will be given six months to install at least 100 cameras on pedestrian bridges, at traffic junctions and entry points into Delhi. ""The monitoring will be done by different agencies, but all challans will be issued through government portals,"" the official said. For instance, the integrated traffic management system (ITMS), for which the cameras are being acquired, will provide a video-based speed violation notice to cars whose licence plates are captured by the cameras. The system will generate a violation alert and the operator will be able to review the captured event. The challan will be issued through the Intelligent eChallan System, which has the ability to generate e-notices against all vehicles violating the rules detected through video analytics or through integration with multiple databases such as those of Vahan or GST. The ANPR cameras can similarly capture the licence plate of vehicles violating the red light or stop line at intersections. Experts are optimistic these cameras will rein in habitual rule breakers. Professor PK Sarkar, former head, transport planning, School of Planning Architecture, said, "" Artificial Intelligence technologies will be handy for traffic management in Delhi because they have been given a proper trial at the back end and would have identified violations correctly 99% of the time.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/ai-to-use-numberplate-detect-19-different-violations-on-road/articleshow/106681437.cms
2024-01-10,The AI ‘effect’: Duolingo cuts 10% of contractual jobs,TOI Tech Desk,"Duolingo , the popular language-learning app , has cut 10% of its contractors, according to Bloomberg, as it turns to generative AI for creating content for its app. This move comes months after the CEO announced that the company is relying more on generative AI to develop its content. “We just no longer need as many people to do the type of work some of these contractors were doing. Part of that could be attributed to AI,” a company spokesperson told Bloomberg. Duolingo had 600 full-time employees at the end of 2022, based on company filings. Recently, an individual who worked for Duolingo as a contractor claimed on Reddit that the company had terminated a significant number of jobs. The contractor stated that in December 2023, a considerable percentage of the contractors who were responsible for translations were let go as the company realised AI could perform translations faster and cheaper. “In December 2023, Duolingo ‘off boarded’ a huge percentage of their contractors who did translations,” the contractor wrote on Reddit. “Of course this is because they figured out that AI can do these translations in a fraction of the time. Plus it saves them money.” According to a spokesperson, the reduction in jobs at Duolingo does not mean that employees are being replaced with AI technology. Its full-time employees and contractors already use the technology in their work, so the job reduction is not a direct result of implementing AI. The spokesperson stated that none of the full-time employees were impacted by the cutback. Duolingo's CEO, Luis von Ahn, mentioned in a letter to shareholders in November that the company is using generative AI technology to speed up the creation of text, speech, and images. This technology is being used to create new content, such as scripts for language teaching shows, at a significantly faster pace. Additionally, the company is using AI to generate voices within the app. Duolingo has also introduced a premium tier, Duolingo Max, which features AI-generated feedback and conversations in languages other than English.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/the-ai-effect-duolingo-cuts-10-of-contractual-jobs/articleshow/106669338.cms

2024-01-09,Google faces multibillion-dollar US patent trial over AI technology,Reuters,"BOSTON: Alphabet's Google is set to go before a federal jury in Boston on Tuesday in a trial over accusations that processors it uses to power artificial intelligence technology in key products infringe a computer scientist's patents. Singular Computing, founded by Massachusetts-based computer scientist Joseph Bates, claims Google copied his technology and used it to support AI features in Google Search, Gmail, Google Translate and other Google services. A Google court filing said that Singular has requested up to $7 billion in monetary damages, which would be more than double the largest-ever patent infringement award in US history. Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda called Singular's patents ""dubious"" and said that Google developed its processors ""independently over many years."" ""We look forward to setting the record straight in court,"" Castaneda said. An attorney for Singular declined to comment on the case. The trial is expected to last two to three weeks. Singular's 2019 complaint said Bates shared his computer-processing innovations with Google between 2010 and 2014. Singular said Google's Tensor Processing Units, which enhance the tech giant's AI capabilities, copy Bates' technology and infringe two patents. The lawsuit said that Google's circuits use an improved architecture Bates discovered that allows for greater processing power and has ""revolutionized the way AI training and inference are accomplished."" Google introduced its processing units in 2016 to power AI used for speech recognition, content generation, ad recommendation and other functions. Singular said that versions 2 and 3 of the units, introduced in 2017 and 2018, violate its patent rights.

2024-01-09,artificial intelligence to enhance potency of social engineering attacks,TNN,"BENGALURU: Ransomware attacks nearly doubled to around 4,200 last year as compared to 2,200 in 2022, showed threat intelligence firm Cyble's Threat Landscape Report 2023-24. The report said proliferation of AI technology is expected to significantly enhance the potency of social engineering attacks . AI-driven advancements enable attackers to craft highly-personalised and convincing social engineering tactics. The US suffered the highest number of attacks from ransomware groups and other threat actors. Following the US, the government, law enforcement agencies (LEA), and banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sectors in India were targeted the most. Professional services, manufacturing, and construction remained the most attacked sectors throughout last year. Even though 2023 saw a rise in ransomware attacks against all industry sectors - healthcare, transportation & logistics, and energy & utilities faced some of the most brutal attacks. The report said ransomware groups like Lockbit, ALPHV, and CL0P were responsible for over 42% of ransomware attacks this year. Ransomware attacks spread across 117 countries around the world last year, with the US, the UK, Canada, Germany, and Italy-based organisations accounting for 65% of total ransomware attacks. Cyble's research showed brand sustainability for ransomware groups is increasingly becoming more challenging due to declining ransom payments, increased enforcement actions by LEA, the cost of continued innovation to remain pertinent and evade detection, the disintegration of affiliate networks to launch their own services, and the emergence of small and stealthy groups that are ready to settle for less. Deception-based attacks have seen a notable increase through the use of SEO (search engine optimisation) poisoning, malvertising, QR codes, and open-source package supply chain attacks. QR fraud generally refers to fraudulent activities or scams that involve the use of QR codes. Scammers use ""quishing"" tactics, sending phishing emails with QR codes to deceive recipients. Pretending to represent reputable companies, these emails falsely claim issues like failed online payments, urging victims to scan QR codes to re-enter credit card details. In 2023, threat actors expanded their toolkit to include languages such as Rust, Go, and Nim - diverging from the more conventionally used languages such as Microsoft Visual C++, C# .Net, and Java.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/artificial-intelligence-to-enhance-potency-of-social-engineering-attacks/articleshow/106649681.cms

2024-01-08,Canada's anti-money laundering body to leverage AI bets to crack down on bad actors,Reuters,"TORONTO: Canada 's anti-money laundering agency is increasing its reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) to detect suspicious transactions , betting the use of the latest technology will help better fight financial crimes , a top official said. The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre ( FINTRAC ) raised a few eyebrows last month when it fined the country's two biggest banks - Royal Bank of Canada and CIBC - for a total of C$9 million ($6.7 million) for violations that included failing to submit suspicious transaction reports, setting a record for fines issued on individual banks. In comparison, the agency has collected C$23 million in penalties across most business sectors since it received the authority to do so in 2008. Canada has a reputation of being a law-abiding democracy; think tanks like C D Howe estimate between C$100 billion and C$130 billion is laundered annually in the country. FINTRAC's Deputy Director for Supervision Donna Achimov told Reuters that AI is allowing humans who have the right mindset to analyze much more data than ever before and making it easier to detect more suspicious activity. The federal government has also added new powers relating to national security, helping FINTRAC staff up in recent years. Staffing levels increased about 28% in fiscal 2023 from two years ago. The additional resources will help the agency led by Sarah Paquet to work in real-time and mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing risks. Achimov said one way forward for FINTRAC is to use new technology to scour for suspicious transactions, or additionally to even partner with financial institutions to lower risks. Suspicious transactions for the 2022-2023 financial year reached 560,858 compared with 585,853 in the previous year and sharply higher than the 114,422 reported in 2015-2016. About 75% of all suspicious transactions between April and September 2023 were reported by financial institutions. The agency has also significantly increased the frequency of meetings to a quarterly occurrence with the larger banks and has held meetings with small and medium-sized banks regularly. FINTRAC's increased scrutiny comes at a time when TD is facing a rare probe and a likely fine by the U.S. Department of Justice related to its AML practices, shortly after it called off its First Horizon acquisition. AML and legal experts said FINTRAC's decision to name the banks instead of handling administrative penalties behind closed doors indicates an increase in enforcement activities in the future. ""Everybody's got to take a closer look ... we got to make sure that we've got our i's dotted, cross our t's and we're not letting that dirty money get into our institutions,"" said Garry Clement, financial crime prevention expert and CEO of Clement Advisory Group.

This time, the lawsuit has been filed by book authors who claim that their copyrighted works were unlawfully used by the companies to develop a highly profitable artificial intelligence system .The authors have accused OpenAI and Microsoft of outright stealing their intellectual property without permission. A lawsuit has been filed in Manhattan federal court by non-fiction authors Nicholas Basbanes and Nicholas Gage, as reported by NBC. Basbanes and Gage are seeking to represent a group of writers whose copyrighted work has allegedly been consistently stolen by Microsoft and OpenAI. ""They're no different than any other thief,"" the lawsuit alleged. The lawsuit aims to claim damages of up to $150,000 for each of the works that the defendants are accused of infringing. The lawsuit further alleged that OpenAI's system relies on being trained by ingesting ""massive amounts of written material,"" which includes books written by Basbanes and Gage. Microsoft or OpenAI haven't issued a statement or comment on the matter. OpenAI, a leading artificial intelligence research organisation, has been hit with a lawsuit by the Authors' Guild and a group of prominent authors including Jonathan Franzen, John Grisham, George R.R. Martin, and Jodi Picoult. Apart from that, other authors -- Michael Chabon, David Henry Hwang, Rachel Louise Snyder and Ayelet Waldman -- have also filed a lawsuit over copyright content.

2024-01-07,This 'AI grandma' conjures children's tales in Telugu,Sribala Vadlapatla,"The platform can generate little nuggets - five to 10 lines long - on ethics and good conduct while responding to specific prompts. HYDERABAD: A team of Artificial Intelligence experts sitting in Hyderabad were not impressed when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman visited India in June last year and said an Indian start-up would not be able to replicate ChatGPT, at least on a foundational level. Instead of adding to the raging controversy on 'X' immediately after his comments, they decided to build something. A little more than six months later we have the AI platform Chandamama Kathalu (Chandamama stories). You can call it 'digital Dadi' that can conjure up and narrate stories to children in Telugu . Of course, Chandamama Kathalu is not ChatGPT-II, but those who built it believe this is only the start. They are keen on building more complex platforms in the future. The team of techies worked with 10,000 students across engineering colleges from the city for the first time in the country to build the platform. Digital dadi first regional AI platform: Developers The platform can generate little nuggets - five to 10 lines long - on ethics and good conduct while responding to specific prompts. According to the team, this is the first ever regional (Telugu) AI platform with about 200 prompts for now. City-based organisation Swecha, working with the motive of democratising technology and bridging the digital divide with open free source architecture, helped build the platform with just 50,000. Praveen Chandrahas, secretary of Swecha, told STOI, ""We need a large data bank to come up with any new initiative using an AI platform. We have fed 40,000 Telugu children's stories available online as base data for AI to work on. When we type, for example, Anaganaga oka raju (Ek tha raja), one of the prompts we have developed, it will generate the shortest story quickly. The prompt is something like a question or search word put in Google or ChatGPT. We can build more prompts in the future."" City-based tech company Ozonetel provided the support for the entire exercise. ""We believe that technology's best purpose is to be able to use it for all sections of society irrespective of language, gender, class,"" Chaitanya Chokkareddy, co-founder of Ozonetel, said. ""We want to broaden this initiative. We can feed any Indian epic or folk story for children to the platform and AI can come up with a completely new story of its own."" The developers say that they have deliberately used Telugu as many believe English is preferred over regional languages and the younger generation is losing touch with its mother tongue. ""Everyone who worked on the project was well-versed in Telugu and worked without charging a penny,"" Naveen Cherukupally, a young techie and student charter in-charge of Swecha, said. Lauding the platform, IT and industries principal secretary, Jayesh Ranjan, said ""Developments that mark the convergence of technology, culture, and innovation can bring significant global impact. With Telugu being a widely spoken language, there is a dire need for a local language model that can spawn numerous societal innovations.

2024-01-05,"No exemption for Apple and Disney on AI oversight, SEC says",TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Apple and Disney will have to include shareholder votes regarding their use of artificial intelligence (AI) in their upcoming annual meetings, as ruled by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The requests made by both companies to exclude these calls for reports on AI usage were rejected by the SEC . The use of AI technology by corporations has gained popularity due to its promised efficiencies. However, concerns have been raised about the potential replacement of creative and professional workers or the unfair utilization of their work. These issues have been a part of recent labor disputes in Hollywood and even led to a lawsuit by The New York Times. The AFL-CIO, the largest labor union federation in the United States, filed similar shareholder proposals at Apple and Disney, along with four other technology companies. The AFL-CIO's pension trust requested a report on Apple's use of AI in its business operations and the disclosure of any ethical guidelines adopted by the company. A similar request was made to Disney, asking for a report on its board's oversight of AI usage. The AFL-CIO stated in its supporting statement that AI systems should not be trained using copyrighted works or the voices, likenesses, and performances of professional performers without transparency, consent, and compensation to creators and rights holders. Brandon Rees, deputy director of the AFL-CIO's office of investment, believes that the SEC's decisions could lead to agreements with Apple and Disney, aligning them with other companies like Microsoft in terms of AI disclosures. Rees expressed concerns that Apple and Disney have not yet addressed these ethical issues surrounding AI. Both Apple and Disney have not yet responded to requests for comment. The companies had argued that the proposals should be excluded from the ballot as they relate to ordinary business operations, such as the choice of technologies. However, the SEC disagreed with this argument, stating that the proposals go beyond ordinary business matters and do not seek to micromanage the companies. OTT platfroms rely on AI to curate content and ads for users OTT platforms curating content for users based on their viewing preferences is not a new idea. However, with AI, things have become much easier for them as they usually use the viewing algorithm from users and use AI to curate similar type of content that the viewer might be interested in.

2024-01-05,This AI model can predict specific Covid-19 variant waves,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"India is again getting hit by a Covid-19 wave and there has been a jump in cases. Amid this, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US have developed an AI model that can predict which SARS-CoV-2 variants are likely to cause new waves of infection. One of the implementations of AI technology is in the medical field and current models that can predict viral transmission do not predict variant-specific spread of infection. How scientists developed this AI model Led by Retsef Levi from MIT’s Sloan School of Management, a team studied the factors that could shape the viral spread based on an analysis of 9 million SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences. These sequences were collected by the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) from 30 countries. The data also includes vaccination rates and infection rates. According to the findings published in the journal PNAS Nexus, the team used the patterns that emerged from this analysis to build a machine learning-enabled risk assessment model. This is claimed to detect 72.8% of the variants in each country that will cause at least 1,000 cases per million people in the next three months. “This work provides an analytical framework that leverages multiple data sources, including genetic sequence data and epidemiological data via machine-learning models to provide improved early signals on the spread risk of new SARS-CoV-2 variants,” the researchers said. While the 72.8% predictive accuracy is obtained after an observation period of one week after detection, the performance increases to 80.1% after two weeks of observation. Scientists have called for more research in this direction and said that a similar approach can potentially be extended to other respiratory viruses such as influenza, avian flu viruses, or other coronaviruses.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/this-ai-model-can-predict-specific-covid-19-variant-waves/articleshow/106554465.cms

The amendments are likely to be notified soon by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. There has been speculation that the government is likely to introduce in the upcoming Digital India Bill similar provisions that seek to empower users to seek algorithmic accountability from internet intermediaries and social media companies like Facebook, Instagram and others. What are the amendments coming * AI algorithms free from ""bias"": The amendments are likely to mandate that platforms which use artificially intelligent algorithms or language models to train their machines are free from “bias” of any kind, they said. New rules may mandate that such AI algorithms or language models that have inherent biases or are trained on such datasets which give out biassed answers be barred from launching for open use. “The parameters for bias that we have right now are centred around caste, religion, community and national security, among other parameters. There will be a legal obligation on platforms to ensure all these parameters are followed, thereby expanding the ambit of trust and safety of the internet,” a senior government official told ET on condition of anonymity. * New rules for deep fake: The IT Rules amendments may also bring new rules to check as well as prevent deepfake and synthetic content. Government on numerous occasions has highlighted the dangers of deep fake. The advisory on deepfake and synthetic content is likely to be very specific on the dos and don’ts for platforms and how to tackle the issue. * Strict guideline for loan apps: There are also likely to be explicit instructions for platforms on loan apps. The approach is said t be to prevent such loan apps from operating in India either through a white-listing of the legitimate apps or placing a banking gateway which prevents the transactions through such apps Why amendments in IT Rules They said the government's decision to amend the IT Act may be prompted by the fact that the Digital India Bill is still some time away and developments around generative AI are progressing rapidly.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/government-may-amend-it-act-2021-to-add-these-new-rules-why-and-what-they-are-to-be/articleshow/106528324.cms
2024-01-04,"New AI tool may help better detect, treat cancers: Study",PTI,"NEW DELHI: Researchers have developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) tool that interprets medical images with unprecedented clarity and may help clinicians diagnose and better treat cancers that might otherwise go undetected. The tool, called iStar (Inferring Super-Resolution Tissue Architecture), and developed by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania , US, provides both highly detailed views of individual cells and a broader look at the full spectrum of how people's genes operate. The imaging technique, described in the journal Nature Biotechnology, would allow doctors to see cancer cells that might otherwise have been virtually invisible, the researchers said. This tool can be used to determine whether safe margins were achieved through cancer surgeries and automatically provide annotation for microscopic images, paving the way for molecular disease diagnosis at that level, they said. The researchers said iStar has the ability to automatically detect critical anti-tumor immune formations called ""tertiary lymphoid structures,"" whose presence correlates with a patient's likely survival and favourable response to immunotherapy, which is often given for cancer and requires high precision in patient selection. This means that iStar could be a powerful tool for determining which patients would benefit most from immunotherapy, they said. ""The power of iStar stems from its advanced techniques, which mirror, in reverse, how a pathologist would study a tissue sample,"" said Mingyao Li, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. ""Just as a pathologist identifies broader regions and then zooms in on detailed cellular structures, iStar can capture the overarching tissue structures and also focus on the minutiae in a tissue image,"" Li explained. To test the efficacy of the tool, the researchers evaluated iStar on many different types of cancer tissue, including breast, prostate, kidney, and colorectal cancers, mixed with healthy tissues. Within these tests, iStar was able to automatically detect tumour and cancer cells that were hard to identify just by eye, according to the researchers. Clinicians in the future may be able to pick up and diagnose more hard-to-see or hard-to-identify cancers with iStar acting as a layer of support, they said. In addition to the clinical possibilities presented by the iStar technique, the tool moves extremely quickly compared to other, similar AI tools. For example, when set up with the breast cancer dataset the team used, iStar finished its analysis in just nine minutes. By contrast, the best competitor AI tool took more than 32 hours to come up with a similar analysis, making iStar 213 times faster. ""The implication is that iStar can be applied to a large number of samples, which is critical in large-scale biomedical studies,"" Li added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/new-ai-tool-may-help-better-detect-treat-cancers-study/articleshow/106523437.cms

2024-01-03,"Cyber awareness campaign reaches S Kol college, cops focus on AI, share safety tips",Dwaipayan Ghosh,"Kolkata: In this age of artificial intelligence , sharing photographs in open sources indiscriminately might help in “reliving memories”, but can immediately be perceived as data by cyber crooks who can cause considerable damage to the user. The annual students’ week celebration at the Asutosh College on Tuesday turned into a cyber-awareness programme where police shared tips on the safe use of social media platforms and on protecting themselves from online frauds. The one-hour presentation by the south division cyber cell saw sergeant Suvankar Chakraborty spend a long time on AI. Stating this was a “problem of the future,” he showed a video clip how a nine-year-old’s photographs were used by criminals to steal her identity. This was the first time in recent memory when cops used a presentation to display the possible harmful impact of AI if one is not careful. “We are not against any technology as this will make life so much easier. But safety is required, as with any technology,” said Chakraborty. Sergeant Chakraborty insisted that ‘Sharenting’ — the manner in which parents share too many details of their children’s activities and achievements on social media — can affect a minor’s future. Among the other new age crimes that got discussed were sextortion, crypto currency fraud, fake hotel and dining bookings and work-from-home job frauds. The cops received several queries on crypto currency. “Crypto currency is a raging issue. It includes benefits but often fraudsters add us to WhatsApp/Telegram groups without our permission, wherein people are seen rejoicing for their profit that is virtual in nature. Hence, simply report, block and exit the group if you do get added in any such group without your permission,” stated a cop in reply to one such query on its safety.

2023-12-31,artificial intelligence lowers barrier to ultrasonic brain treatment,ANI,"SEJONG: Using ultrasound energy to target specific millimetres of the brain, including deep areas, focused ultrasound technology is a non-invasive therapeutic approach that treats neurological disorders without necessitating opening the skull. Because it doesn't harm nearby good tissue and reduces side effects like infections and difficulties, it has been used to treat a range of resistant brain disorders, including depression and Alzheimer's disease . Its use has been restricted, nevertheless, because it is challenging to reflect in real-time the distortion of ultrasonic waves caused by the various shapes of patients' skulls. An acoustic simulation technology based on generative AI has been developed by a research team led by Dr. Kim, Hyungmin of the Bionics Research Centre at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST). This technology can be used to predict and correct the distortion of the ultrasound focus position caused by the skull during focused ultrasound therapy in real time. Thus far, there has been no validation of the clinical usefulness of AI simulation models in the field of non-invasive focused ultrasound therapy technologies. However, its application has been limited thus far since it is difficult to reflect the distortion of ultrasound waves generated by the varied shapes of patients' skulls in real-time. A research team led by Dr. Kim, Hyungmin of the Bionics Research Center at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) has developed a real-time acoustic simulation technology based on generative AI to predict and correct the distortion of the ultrasound focus position caused by the skull in real-time during focused ultrasound therapy. Until now, the clinical applicability of AI simulation models in the field of non-invasive focused ultrasound therapy technology has not been validated. To predict the location of the invisible acoustic focus, navigation systems based on medical images taken before treatment are currently utilized, which provide information about the relative position of the patient and the ultrasound transducer. However, they are limited by their inability to account for the distortion of ultrasound waves caused by the skull, and while various simulation techniques have been used to compensate for this, they still require significant computational time, making them difficult to apply in actual clinical practice. The research team developed a real-time focused ultrasound simulation technology through an artificial intelligence model based on a generative adversarial neural network (GAN), a deep learning model widely used for image generation in the medical field. The technology reduces the update time of three-dimensional simulation information reflecting changes in ultrasound acoustic waves from 14 s to 0.1 s while showing an average maximum acoustic pressure error of less than 7 per cent and a focal position error of less than 6mm, both of which are within the error range of existing simulation technologies, increasing the possibility of clinical application. The research team also developed a medical image-based navigation system to verify the performance of the developed technology to rapidly deploy it to real-world clinical practice. The system can provide real-time acoustic simulations at the rate of 5 Hz depending on the position of the ultrasound transducer, and succeeded in predicting the position of the ultrasound energy and focus within the skull in real-time during focused ultrasound therapy. Previously, due to the long calculation time, the ultrasound transducer had to be precisely positioned in a pre-planned location to utilize the simulation results. However, with the newly developed simulation-guided navigation system, it is now possible to adjust the ultrasound focus based on the acoustic simulation results obtained in real-time. In the future, it is expected to improve the accuracy of focused ultrasound and provide safe treatment for patients by being able to quickly respond to unexpected situations that may occur during the treatment process. ""As the accuracy and safety of focused ultrasound brain disease treatment has been improved through this research, more clinical applications will emerge,"" said Dr. Kim, Hyungmin of KIST. ""For practical use, we plan to verify the system by diversifying the ultrasound sonication environment, such as multi-array ultrasound transducers.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/artificial-intelligence-lowers-barrier-to-ultrasonic-brain-treatment/articleshow/106424953.cms

2023-12-25,"New AI model may predict human lifespan, researchers say",PTI,"NEW DELHI: Researchers have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that uses sequences of life events — such as health history, education, job and income — to predict everything from an individual's personality to their lifespan. Built using transformer models, which power large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT , the tool called life2vec is trained on a data set pulled from the entire population of Denmark. Life2vec is capable of predicting the future, including the lifespan of individuals, with an accuracy that exceeds state-of-the-art models, the researchers said. However, despite its predictive power, the research team said it is best used as the foundation for future work, not an end in itself. ""Even though we're using prediction to evaluate how good these models are, the tool shouldn't be used for prediction on real people,"" says Tina Eliassi-Rad, a professor at Northeastern University, US. ""It is a prediction model based on a specific data set of a specific population,” Eliassi-Rad said. By involving social scientists in the process of building this tool, the team hopes it brings a human-centered approach to AI development that doesn't lose sight of the humans amid the massive data set their tool has been trained on. ""This model offers a much more comprehensive reflection of the world as it is lived by human beings than many other models,"" said Sune Lehmann, author of the study published in the journal Nature Computational Science. At the heart of life2vec is the massive data set that the researchers used to train their model. The researchers used that data to create long patterns of recurring life events to feed into their model, taking the transformer model approach used to train LLMs on language and adapting it for a human life represented as a sequence of events. ""The whole story of a human life, in a way, can also be thought of as a giant long sentence of the many things that can happen to a person,"" said Lehmann, a professor at the Technical University of Denmark. The model uses the information it learns from observing millions of life event sequences to build what is called vector representations in embedding spaces, where it starts to categorize and draw connections between life events like income, education, or health factors. These embedding spaces serve as a foundation for the predictions the model ends up making, the researchers said. One of the life events that the researchers predicted was a person's probability of mortality. ""When we visualise the space that the model uses to make predictions, it looks like a long cylinder that takes you from low probability of death to high probability of death,"" Lehmann said. ""Then we can show that in the end where there's a high probability of death, a lot of those people actually died, and in the end where there's low probability of dying, the causes of death are something that we couldn't predict, like car accidents,” the researcher added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-ai-model-may-predict-human-lifespan-researchers-say/articleshow/106262986.cms
2023-12-23,Infosys loses $1.5 billion deal on AI solutions with global firm,TOI Business Desk,"Infosys, the IT services giant, has said that a $1.5 billion agreement with an undisclosed global company has been terminated. The deal focused on artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. Signed in September for a 15-year period, the deal aimed to provide digital transformation and modernization services through Infosys ' platforms and AI solutions. In a stock exchange filing on Saturday, Infosys stated, ""The global company has now elected to terminate the Memorandum of Understanding and the parties will not be pursuing the Master Agreement."" However, Infosys did not reveal the name of the global company or whether it was an existing client, said an ET report. Top Picks For You End of work from home? Infosys wants entry & mid-level staff to work from office 10 days a month In IT, salary hikes not for all, tenure matters This termination comes shortly after Nilanjan Roy, the company's CFO, unexpectedly resigned after serving in the position for approximately six years. The loss of this deal adds further pressure on Infosys and potentially other IT companies, who have been struggling due to muted business over the past few quarters. In addition to significant senior-level management turnover, which has seen at least eight departures in the past year, this could pose challenges for Infosys' future growth path. Despite these challenges, Infosys has recently announced several other deals. Last week, the company revealed a five-year agreement with auto parts distributor LKQ Europe. They have also secured significant deals in the past, including a $1.64 billion deal with London-based Liberty Global and a $2 billion deal with an existing client in July. There’s also a $454 million deal with Danske Bank. In the September quarter, Infosys secured its largest deals ever, amounting to $7.7 billion in total. However, Infosys reported a muted revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal year FY24, leading them to revise their full-year revenue guidance.

2023-12-22,Tick-tock:AI model gets spookily accurate about time of death,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Friends, Romans, and Algorithm-ians — AI can actually accurately predict when you are going to kick the bucket. Imagine a machine gazing into your future and whispering your expiration date. A new study from Denmark has developed an AI tool that attempts to do just that, predicting individual lifespans with unsettling accuracy. “We do this by drawing on a comprehensive registry dataset, which is available for Denmark across several years, and that includes information about life-events related to health, education, occupation, income, address and working hours, recorded with day-to-day resolution,” said researchers from Denmark. “We use the technology behind ChatGPT (something called transformer models) to analyse human lives by representing each person as the sequence of events that happens in their life,” Sune Lehmann, lead author of the study, told The New York Post. How does the AI tool calculate ‘death’? As per the study — conducted on people in Denmark, first life-sequences are constructed based on labour and health records from Danish national registers. The dataset includes records about income, such as salary, scholarship, job type, industry, social benefits and so on. Furthermore, records about how many times a person has been doctors or hospitals, what’s the diagnostic history and other medical details. The study used all the public information of the subjects and then assigns digital tokens. The AI model was able to accurately predict who had died by 2020 by 78%. “We can observe how individual lives evolve in a space of diverse event types (information about a heart attack is mixed with salary increases or information about moving from an urban to a rural area).” The study's findings also hold promise for the future of preventative healthcare. According to the study, the model opens a range of possibilities within the social and health sciences. “By means of a rich dataset, we can capture complex patterns and trends in individual lives and represent their stories in a compact vector representation,” the study noted. It's important to remember that Life2Vec and similar models are statistical tools, not fortune-telling oracles. Numerous unpredictable factors can influence an individual's lifespan, making it impossible to pinpoint exact death dates.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/tick-tockai-model-gets-spookily-accurate-about-time-of-death/articleshow/106212242.cms
2023-12-22,THIS artificial intelligence can now 'accurately' predict when you will die,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Until now what was predicted approximately, is now being done with 'accuracy' by one AI death calculator . Yes, this new AI calculator can predict death ! This calculator can predict the death of an individual with more than 75% accuracy. ""A newly developed AI death calculator can now forecast when a person will die with eerily exact accuracy,"" the NewYork Post reported. The details of the death calculator are released in a study titled ""Using sequence of life-events to predict human lives."" “We use the technology behind ChatGPT (something called transformer models) to analyze human lives by representing each person as the sequence of events that happens in their life,” Sune Lehmann, lead author of the study told the New York Post. The algorithm based on which the calculator has been designed is called ""life2vec"". It determines the death date of an individual, with 78% accuracy, based on income, profession, residence and health history. ""For now, we can only look at data across an eight-year period and for a subset of users aged 25–70 years (and 35–65 years for early mortality prediction),"" the researchers from Denmark and the U.S. have said. The study is published in the Nature Computational Science online journal. “This model can predict almost anything,” Lehmann told the media and added, “we predicted death because it’s something people have worked on for many years (for example, insurance companies), so we had a good sense of what was possible."" However, Lehmann emphasized to The Post that no study participants were given their death predictions , the media reported. How does the death calculator work? Those who are curious to know how this functions and are eager to feed their data into this AI algorithm should know that it is not available for public right now. ""We are actively working on ways to share some of the results more openly, but this requires further research to be done in a way that can guarantee the privacy of the people in the study,' Lehmann told the Daily Mail.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/this-artificial-intelligence-can-now-accurately-predict-when-you-will-die/articleshow/106217605.cms
2023-12-21,UK's top court rules AI can't be patent 'inventor',Reuters,"LONDON: A US computer scientist on Wednesday lost his bid to register patents over inventions created by his artificial intelligence system in a landmark case in Britain about whether AI can own patent rights. Stephen Thaler wanted to be granted two patents in the UK for inventions he says were devised by his ""creativity machine"" called DABUS . His attempt to register the patents was refused by Britain's Intellectual Property Office on grounds that the inventor must be a human or a company, rather than a machine. He appealed to UK's Supreme Court, which unanimously rejected his appeal as under UK patent law ""an inventor must be a natural person"". ""This appeal is not concerned with the broader question whether technical advances generated by machines acting autonomously and powered by AI should be patentable,"" the judge said. ""Nor is it concerned with the question whether the meaning of the term 'inventor' ought to be expanded.. to include machines powered by AI which generate new and non-obvious products and processes which may be thought to offer benefits over products and processes which are already known."" Thaler lost a similar bid in the US, where the SC declined to hear a challenge to the Patent and Trademark Office's refusal to issue patents for inventions created by AI.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uks-top-court-rules-ai-cant-be-patent-inventor/articleshow/106163644.cms

2023-12-18,How Deloitte is looking at AI to avoid mass job cuts in future,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Many fear AI (artificial intelligence) taking away jobs. But there are companies that plan to use the technology to avoid layoffs. The consulting giant Deloitte is reportedly looking to artificial intelligence to avoid mass job cuts. According to a report in Bloomberg, Deloitte LLP is using AI to evaluate existing staffers’ skills and map out plans that would shift employees away from quieter parts of the business and into roles that are more in demand. It’s reported to be part of the broader bet by the company to use the technology to moderate hiring growth over time. Deloitte's move to retain its employees using AI comes after the company hired in large numbers in the years after the pandemic. Deloitte is said to have added 130,000 employees to its global headcount earlier this year. Deloitte’s total headcount is now nearing 460,000 after the hiring spree earlier this year. That’s triple the number of new hires compared with a decade ago, when revenue was roughly half of what it is today. Doom and gloom In the midst of these hirings, the company is said to have warned thousands of staffers in the US and UK that their jobs were at risk of becoming redundant after the company was forced to restructure certain areas of the business in response to a slowdown in demand. “It is obviously a great objective to be able to avoid large swings of hirings and layoffs,” Stevan Rolls , global chief talent officer at Deloitte, told Bloomberg. “You could always be more efficient and effective about finding the right people.” “Let’s imagine Deloitte was so successful and we doubled our size again, I’d be really worried about hiring a quarter of a million people a year,” Rolls said. “It might not be fewer, but it might be the same as we hire now.” Incidentally, Deloitte seems to be among several consulting companies trying to figure out how to deal with all their new hires, especially as business remains slow amid an uncertain economy. Others in the list are said to be Bain, Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/how-deloitte-is-looking-at-ai-to-avoid-mass-job-cuts-in-future/articleshow/106096482.cms
2023-12-17,Deloitte Is Looking to AI to Help Avoid Mass Layoffs in Future,Bloomberg,"The giants of the consulting world face an unusual quandary this year: many of them are in the process of dismissing hundreds of staffers even after they hired thousands of college graduates to deal with new demand. Now, one of the biggest of them all is looking to artificial intelligence to change that. Deloitte LLP is using AI to evaluate existing staffers’ skills and map out plans that would shift employees away from quieter parts of the business and into roles that are more in demand. It’s part of a broader bet by the professional services firm that the technology will allow it to moderate hiring growth over time. The moves come after Deloitte added 130,000 staffers this year. But in the midst of those hirings, though, the firm warned thousands of staffers in the US and UK that their jobs were at risk of becoming redundant after the company was forced to restructure certain areas of the business in response to a slowdown in demand. “It is obviously a great objective to be able to avoid large swings of hirings and layoffs ,” said Stevan Rolls, global chief talent officer at Deloitte. “You could always be more efficient and effective about finding the right people.” Deloitte and rival professional services firms have already begun experimenting with using generative artificial intelligence to eliminate repetitive, time-consuming work that was long reserved for junior staffers, such as prepping documents for internal meetings or gathering troves of data for a client pitch. Generative AI, which was popularized by ChatGPT, can produce sentences or essays in response to simple questions and it crafts these responses after being trained on reams of existing material. With the latest projects, though, they’re hoping the technology can help them better manage the thousands of employees they add every year.

2023-12-14,Chinese mourners use AI to digitally resurrect the dead,AFP,"TAIZHOU: At a quiet cemetery in eastern China, bereaved father Seakoo Wu pulls out his phone, places it on a gravestone and plays a recording of his son. They are words that the late student never spoke, but brought into being with artificial intelligence . ""I know you're in great pain every day because of me, and feel guilty and helpless,"" intones Xuanmo in a slightly robotic voice. ""Even though I can't be by your side ever again, my soul is still in this world, accompanying you through life."" Stricken by grief, Wu and his wife have joined a growing number of Chinese people turning to AI technology to create lifelike avatars of their departed. Ultimately Wu wants to build a fully realistic replica that behaves just like his dead son but dwells in virtual reality. ""Once we synchronise reality and the metaverse, I'll have my son with me again,"" Wu said. ""I can train him... so that when he sees me, he knows I'm his father."" Some Chinese firms claim to have created thousands of "" digital people"" from as little as 30 seconds of audiovisual material of the deceased. Experts say they can offer much-needed comfort for people devastated by the loss of loved ones. But they also evoke an unsettling theme from the British sci-fi series ""Black Mirror"" in which people rely on advanced AI for bereavement support. 'Needs are growing' Wu and his wife were devastated when Xuanmo, their only child, died last year at the age of 22 while attending Exeter University in Britain. The accounting and finance student, keen sportsman and posthumous organ donor ""had such a rich and varied life"", said Wu. ""He always carried in him this desire to help people and a sense of right and wrong,"" he told AFP. Following a boom in deep learning technologies like ChatGPT in China, Wu began researching ways to resurrect him. He gathered photos, videos and audio recordings of his son, and spent thousands of dollars hiring AI firms that cloned Xuanmo's face and voice. The results so far are rudimentary, but he has also set up a work team to create a database containing vast amounts of information on his son. Wu hopes to feed it into powerful algorithms to create an avatar capable of copying his son's thinking and speech patterns with extreme precision. Several companies specialising in so-called ""ghost bots"" have emerged in the United States in recent years. But the industry is booming in China, according to Zhang Zewei, the founder of the AI firm Super Brain and a former collaborator with Wu. ""On AI technology, China is in the highest class worldwide,"" said Zhang from a workspace in the eastern city of Jingjiang. ""And there are so many people in China, many with emotional needs, which gives us an advantage when it comes to market demand."" Super Brain charges between 10,000 and 20,000 yuan ($1,400-$2,800) to create a basic avatar within about 20 days, said Zhang. They range from those who have died to living parents unable to spend time with their children and -- controversially -- a heartbroken woman's ex-boyfriend. Clients can even hold video calls with a staff member whose face and voice are digitally overlaid with those of the person they have lost. ""The significance for... the whole world is huge,"" Zhang said. ""A digital version of someone (can) exist forever, even after their body has been lost."" 'New humanism' Sima Huapeng, who founded Nanjing-based Silicon Intelligence, said the technology would ""bring about a new kind of humanism"". He likened it to portraiture and photography, which helped people commemorate the dead in revolutionary ways. Tal Morse, a visiting research fellow at the Centre for Death and Society at Britain's University of Bath, said ghost bots may offer comfort. But he cautioned that more research was needed to understand their psychological and ethical implications. ""A key question here is... how 'loyal' are the ghost bots to the personality they were designed to mimic,"" Morse told AFP. ""What happens if they do things that will 'contaminate' the memory of the person they are supposed to represent?"" Another quandary arises from the inability of dead people to consent, experts said. While permission was probably unnecessary to mimic speech or behaviour, it might be needed to ""do certain other things with that simulacrum"", said Nate Sharadin, a philosopher at the University of Hong Kong specialising in AI and its social effects. For Super Brain's Zhang, all new technology is ""a double-edged sword"". ""As long as we're helping those who need it, I see no problem"". He doesn't work with those for whom it could have negative impacts, he said, citing a woman who had attempted suicide after her daughter's death. Bereaved father Wu said Xuanmo would ""probably would have been willing"" to be digitally revived. ""One day, son, we will all reunite in the metaverse,"" he said as his wife dissolved into tears before his grave. ""The technology is getting better every day... it's just a matter of time.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinese-mourners-use-ai-to-digitally-resurrect-the-dead/articleshow/105974494.cms

2023-12-12,"Need a global framework to harness AI, but guard against falling in wrong hands: PM Modi at AI Summit",Pankaj Doval,"NEW DELHI: Highlighting the role of AI in driving inclusive growth, prime minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday spoke about the need to create a global framework to manage and monitor the ethical and transparent development and use of the next-gen technology , while warning about the dangers of it falling into the hands of terrorist organisations or other challenges such as deepfakes, cyber security, and data theft. Inaugurating the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) Summit here, the Prime Minister said that as AI starts to play a key role across geographies, there is a need to ensure that countries take steps to ensure the technology is harnessed for larger societal good and driving inclusive growth. Noting the growth of AI as a worldwide movement, the Prime Minister said there should be coordination and collaboration for expediting work on creating a global framework. “We have to complete the global framework within a given time limit. It is very important to do this to protect humanity,” he said, adding that just like collaboration on drafting agreements and protocols on various international issues, there is a need for countries to work together to create a framework for the ethical use of AI, including the testing and development of high-risk or frontier AI tools. The PM, however, warned that while AI has the potential to become the strongest tool for development in the 21st century, it can also play a pivotal role in its destruction. Pointing out the challenges of deepfake, cyber security, data theft, and terrorist organizations getting their hands on AI tools, Modi stressed on the need for countermeasures. ""Besides the challenge of deepfakes, cyber security, and data theft, AI tools falling in the hands of terrorists pose a big threat. Global security will face a big threat if AI-laced weapons were to reach terrorist organisations. We have to deliberate on this issue and reach a concrete plan to stop the misuse of AI.” He highlighted India’s proposal to create a framework for Responsible Human-Centric AI governance during the country’s G20 Presidency and said that the G20 New Delhi Declaration had also reaffirmed the commitment of all member countries towards ‘AI Principles’. Modi said that in order to make any system sustainable, it is important to make it transformative, transparent and trusted. “There is no doubt that AI is transformative, but it is up to us to make it more and more transparent. Keeping the data being used transparent and free from bias will be a good beginning… Trust in AI will grow only when related ethical, economic, and social aspects are addressed. One way to do this is to make upskilling and reskilling part of the AI growth curve. Data protection and assurances to the global south will also assuage many concerns.” On India, he said that the development mantra of the country has been ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’, which has prompted the government to draft its policies and programs with the spirit of AI for All. The government strives to take advantage of AI’s capabilities for social development and inclusive growth, while also committing to its responsible and ethical usage. The PM said that AI will be key in defining the future of the country, especially as it has the power to connect people, ensure economic development and drive in equality and social justice. He, however, emphasized on the the need to make AI and its development more inclusive. “… the more inclusive, the development journey of AI, the more inclusive will be the results.” The PM said that the “unequal access to technology” in the last century had accentuated inequality in the society. “… democratic values should not be neglected in technology in order to make it an inclusion multiplier. Direction of AI development will totally depend on human and democratic values. It is up to us to keep a place for emotions along with efficiency, ethics along with effectiveness.” Addressing the stakeholders in the government, the PM asked them to explore the data of various schemes for evidence-based decision-making and see if the data can be used to train AI tools. Also, he asked if there could be an audit mechanism that can categorize AI tools into red, yellow or green as per their capabilities. “Can we establish an institutional mechanism that ensures resilient employment? Can we bring standardized global AI education curriculum? Can we set standards to prepare people for an AI-driven future?” GPAI is a multi-stakeholder initiative with 29 member countries, which aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice on AI by supporting cutting-edge research and applied activities on AI-related priorities.

2023-12-11,Doctors with knowledge of artificial intelligence will hold advantage: Andrew Elder,PTI,"KOLKATA: Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) will never completely replace a doctor 's job, but medical practitioners knowing the technology will be in an advantageous position compared to those who do not, Professor Andrew Elder , President of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh , has said. AI has the potential to carry out several medical tasks such as diagnosis and surgery more efficiently, quickly, and easily, cutting down the time taken to treat a patient fully, compared to the duration it now takes, he said. However, Elder said it may take another couple of decades for AI to play a significant role in disease diagnosis, but the human application of judgment will continue to be in practice even after that. ""The advantages of AI would be so great that a doctor who says 'I am not using AI at all' will not be as able in his practice as a doctor who uses AI. Too often, we think about humans against technology, and sometimes humans or technology. It should be human with technology,"" Elder told PTI in an interview. The 65-year-old who has been a consultant in medicine for elderly people for 28 years attached to England's National Health Service (NHS), also believes that there could be fewer doctors in future due to the impact of AI. ""But I do not see it completely replacing them,"" he said. Elder said, ""There are at the moment some applications of AI in procedures, but most of the robotic surgeries we have been hearing about do not involve AI…. There are some limited applications in procedures of surgery at the moment, but not that widespread."" The former medical director of MRCP (UK), who was in Kolkata to be part of a conference, added that AI will possibly not be able to judge all situations as that ability comes from experience. ""I think it (AI) has the potential to make some medical tasks more efficient and more quickly to derive information from big databases. I think, however, its role in diagnosis is 10 to 20 years away before we get to choose whether we could be comfortable using it,"" he said. ""There are at the moment some applications of AI in procedures, but most of the robotic surgeries we have been hearing about do not involve AI…. There are some limited applications in procedures of surgery at the moment, but not that widespread,"" he said. On AI's role in drug manufacturing, Elder referred to its contribution to quick vaccine development during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""AI has been used to narrow down the selection of different molecules that may be useful. It was used during the Covid-19 pandemic to help with vaccine development and it did it more quickly than humans could have done. ""Although, overall most people would acknowledge that AI did not contribute as much as people thought it might in the pandemic. Particularly the diagnostic application of AI in the pandemic was not strong,"" he said. Elder also pointed out the possible threats to AI usage in healthcare in case it is developed by untrained people, particularly in the field of medical science. ""I think that if the development of AI in healthcare is predominantly in the hands of people, who are not medically trained, it could go in all sorts of unhelpful directions driven primarily by commercial interests either to generate income or to make healthcare less costly. ""It's very important for people who understand patient care and science to be involved in the development,"" he stated.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/doctors-with-knowledge-of-artificial-intelligence-will-hold-advantage-andrew-elder/articleshow/105909389.cms
2023-12-09,"As European Union passes world's first law to curb artificial intelligence, India set on different approach",TOI News Desk,"NEW DELHI: European Union (EU) lawmakers have passed the world's first comprehensive regulation for artificial intelligence , called the AI Act . The rules, however, won't take effect until 2025 at the earliest, leaving room for a lot of technological evolution until then. “Europe has positioned itself as a pioneer, understanding the importance of its role as global standard setter,” Thierry Breton, the European commissioner who helped negotiate the deal, said in a statement. Top Picks For You India set to take giant leap in AI to empower citizens: PM Modi; invites all to global AI summit The new law still needs to be approved by the European Parliament, though that will be a formality. What the EU's AI Act says European policymakers focused on AI’s riskiest uses by companies and governments, including those for law enforcement and the operation of crucial services like water and energy. Makers of the largest general-purpose AI systems will face transparency requirements. Chatbots and software that creates manipulated images such as ""deepfakes"" would have to make clear that what people were seeing was generated by AI, according to a report by the New York Times. Use of facial recognition software by police and governments would be restricted outside of certain safety and national security exemptions. Companies that violated the regulations could face fines of up to 7% of global sales. Policymakers agreed to what they called a ""risk-based approach"" to regulating AI, where a defined set of applications face the most oversight and restrictions. Companies that make AI tools that pose the most potential harm to individuals and society, such as in hiring and education, would need to provide regulators with proof of risk assessments, breakdowns of what data was used to train the systems and assurances that the software did not cause harm like perpetuating racial biases. Human oversight would also be required in creating and deploying the systems, said the NYT report. Some practices, such as the indiscriminate scraping of images from the internet to create a facial recognition database, would be banned outright. The new regulations will be closely watched globally. They will affect not only major AI developers but other businesses that are expected to use the technology in areas such as education, health care and banking. The law sets a global benchmark for countries seeking to harness the potential benefits of the technology, while trying to protect against its possible risks, like automating jobs, spreading misinformation online and endangering national security. But India seems to have decided that it will be taking a different approach to AI. India not interested in law on AI In the US, the Joe Biden administration recently issued an executive order focused in part on AI’s national security effects . Britain, Japan and other nations have taken a more hands-off approach, while China has imposed some restrictions on data use and recommendation algorithms. Currently, there are no specific laws in India with regard to regulating AI. In fact, IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw recently informed Parliament that the Centre is not planning to regulate the growth or set any laws for AI in the country. “The government is not considering bringing a law or regulating the growth of artificial intelligence in the country,"" Vaishnaw said, but acknowledged that there are ethical concerns and risks around AI and the government has already started making efforts to standardise responsible AI and even promote the adoption of the best practices. Officials said the upcoming Digital Personal Data Protection Bill 2022 will apply to AI developers who develop and facilitate AI technologies. As AI developers will be collecting and using massive amounts of data to train their algorithm to enhance the AI solution, they might be classified as data fiduciaries and will be held responsible for how personal data is used. India looking to harness AI The Centre has taken a proactive stance on technology, particularly AI, intending to position India as a global leader in the field. The BJP-led government sees AI as a ‘kinetic enabler’ and wants to harness its potential for better governance and feels putting stringent regulations in place could stifle innovation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has repeatedly stressed the importance of AI in today's world and recently said India is looking to ""take a giant leap in AI to empower its citizens and is poised to be an active contributor to its evolution"". India is set to host the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) Summit 2023 in New Delhi from December 12-14. India is a co-founder of GPAI, which brings along 28 member countries and the EU as its members to guide the responsible development and use of AI. Regulation without law Many experts said that instead of bringing in laws to govern AI, India may opt to use market mechanisms -- such as principles-based accreditation -- to tackle the situation. The Ministry of Electronics and information Technology (MEITY), is the executive agency for AI-related strategies and has constituted committees to bring in a policy framework for AI, while the Niti Ayog has developed a set of seven responsible AI principles, which include safety & dependability, equality, inclusivity and non-discrimination, privacy and security, transparency, accountability and the protection and reinforcement of positive human values.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/as-european-union-passes-worlds-first-law-to-curb-ai-india-set-on-different-approach-artificial-intelligence-pm-modi/articleshow/105859769.cms

When India leads, it does so to ensure that it can take everyone along towards the goal of the greater good,” he said. With the same spirit in the realm of AI, India's approach has been to enable a universal understanding and a conducive environment, steering the use of AI towards the betterment of humanity, Modi said. In this regard, forums such as the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI), of which India is a co-founder, are crucial. The GPAI brings along 28 member countries and the EU as its members to guide the responsible development and use of AI. Since its inception in June 2020, India has made significant contributions to GPAI, actively engaging in various initiatives to foster the development, deployment and adoption of open, safe, secure, and accountable AI. India's election to its council in November 2022 reflects its dedication to Safe & Trusted AI. As the Lead Chair of the GPAI, India reaffirms its commitment to harnessing technology, particularly AI, for the welfare of people, ensuring that nations of the Global South are not the last to reap its benefits. India is dedicated to clearing the path for a regulatory framework that ensures Safe and Trusted AI, bringing all nations together for widespread and enduring implementation.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-set-to-take-giant-leap-in-ai-to-empower-citizens-modi-invites-all-to-global-ai-summit/articleshow/105859774.cms
2023-12-09,Microsoft's answer to OpenAI inquiry: It doesn't own a stake,Bloomberg,"With global regulators examining Microsoft Corp's $13 billion investment in OpenAI , the software giant has a simple argument it hopes will resonate with antitrust officials: It doesn’t own a traditional stake in the buzzy startup so can’t be said to control it. When Microsoft negotiated an additional $10 billion investment in OpenAI in January, it opted for an unusual arrangement, people familiar with the matter said at the time. Rather than buy a chunk of the cutting-edge artificial intelligence lab, it cut a deal to receive almost half of OpenAI's financial returns until the investment is repaid up to a pre-determined cap, one of the people said. The unorthodox structure was concocted because OpenAI is a capped for-profit company housed inside a non-profit organization. It's not clear regulators see a distinction, however. On Friday the UK Competition and Markets Authority said it was gathering information from stakeholders to determine whether the collaboration between the two firms threatens competition in the UK, home of Google’s AI research lab Deepmind. The US Federal Trade Commission is also examining the nature of Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI and whether it may violate antitrust laws, according to a person familiar with the matter. The inquiries are preliminary and the agency hasn't opened a formal investigation, according to the person, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential matter. Microsoft didn't report the transaction to the agency because the investment in OpenAI doesn't amount to control of the company under US law, the person said. OpenAI is a non-profit and acquisitions of non-corporate entities aren’t reported under US merger law, regardless of value. Agency officials are analyzing the situation and assessing what its options are. “While details of our agreement remain confidential, it is important to note that Microsoft does not own any portion of OpenAI and is simply entitled to a share of profit distributions,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement. Earlier Friday, Microsoft president Brad Smith said “the only thing that has changed is that Microsoft will now have a non-voting observer on OpenAI’s board.” He described its relationship with OpenAI as “very different” from Google’s outright acquisition of DeepMind in the UK. “Our partnership with Microsoft empowers us to pursue our research and develop safe and beneficial AI tools for everyone, while remaining independent and operating competitively. Their non-voting board observer does not provide them with governing authority or control over OpenAI’s operations,” said an OpenAI spokesperson in a statement. From the beginning, Microsoft and OpenAI took pains to telegraph the two companies' independence. Microsoft hoped to reassure investors and customers that it’s not overly reliant on one partner. OpenAI didn’t want employees, customers and other investors thinking it was merely an outpost of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft. That careful positioning was upended last month with the firing of OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman and the startup’s near implosion. The Altman imbroglio demonstrated both Microsoft's lack of control and its influence. Microsoft received just minutes notice that the OpenAI board planned to announce Altman’s ouster, and its executives were not consulted in the decision. Still Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella played a key role, along with other investors, in forcing the board to reverse its decision. At one point Microsoft said it would hire Altman and his OpenAI colleagues to form a new Microsoft AI unit. Once Altman was restored as CEO, Microsoft executives debated the wisdom of taking a seat on the OpenAI board, people familiar with the matter said at the time. On the one hand, executives feared that a board seat or observer slot might draw the attention of regulators. On the other hand, Microsoft wanted to keep a closer eye on its partner and protect its investment—an imperative that carried the day, despite the risks. Ultimately, Microsoft could face a world of regulatory headaches. Regulators in Europe are also paying attention, according to a spokesperson for the European Commission. In order for a transaction to be notifiable to the Commission under the EU Merger Regulation, it has to involve a change of control on a lasting basis. While this transaction has not been formally notified, the Commission had been following the situation even before the management turmoil, the spokesperson said. Last month, Germany’s competition authority said it wasn’t subjecting Microsoft’s OpenAI investment to a merger review. But the regulator said they would hold off only because OpenAI didn’t have substantial business in Germany. After reviewing the transaction and talking the companies, the regulator found the investment would give Microsoft a “material competitive influence” over the AI company that might warrant scrutiny in the future if OpenAI increases its activities in Germany. The partnership raises competition issues if Microsoft cuts back on its own AI research and development or if the investment keeps OpenAI from partnering with the tech giant’s rivals, said Bloomberg Intelligence antitrust analyst Jennifer Rie. Antitrust enforcers may also have concerns about Microsoft’s board observer since it would give Microsoft additional information on OpenAI’s plans even if it doesn’t have rights to influence the decisions.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/microsofts-answer-to-openai-inquiry-it-doesnt-own-a-stake/articleshow/105853786.cms

2023-12-08,Climate groups say AI will make climate change crisis worse,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Several climate groups have penned down an open letter to US president Joe Biden outlining the impact of artificial intelligence on the climate change crisis . The Biden administration passed an executive order in seizing the promise and managing the risks of artificial intelligence (AI). “The Executive Order establishes new standards for AI safety and security, protects Americans’ privacy, advances equity and civil rights, stands up for consumers and workers, promotes innovation and competition, advances American leadership around the world, and more,” the US government said in a press release. “We were disappointed that AI’s potential to worsen the climate change crisis, which President Biden himself referred to as “the number one issue facing humanity,” was not addressed as a risk associated with the widespread use of AI in the EO,” noted the climate groups. Why the worry over AI? The 17 climate groups, include Amazon Employees for Climate Justice , Friends of the Earth, Global Action Plan, Green America, among others. “Unfounded hype from Silicon Valley says that AI can save the planet sometime in the future but research shows the opposite is actually occurring right now,” argued the climate groups. The groups have two main areas of concern: fake news about climate change and energy requirements for AI. “AI LLMs can more quickly, cheaply, and covertly produce and distribute targeted climate disinformation which threatens to perpetuate climate denialism and slow efforts to fight climate change,” the groups said. The second concern is over carbon emissions. “Due to their enormous energy requirements and the carbon footprint associated with their growth and proliferation, the widespread use of LLMs can increase carbon emissions.” What do the groups want? The groups say that tech companies should be required to publicly report on energy use and emissions produced by the full life cycle of AI models, including training, updating and search queries. Furthermore, the groups say that companies must provide an explanation to the general public of how generative AI models produce information, how their accuracy on climate change is measured, and the sources of evidence for factual claims they make.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/climate-groups-say-ai-will-make-climate-change-crisis-worse/articleshow/105844249.cms
2023-12-06,Elon Musk’s $1 billion push to compete against ChatGPT,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Elon Musk 's foray into the world of artificial intelligence , through his company xAI, is looking to make further strides. According to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), xAI is looking to raise $1 billion in equity funding. This move indicates the company's ambitious goals and potentially game-changing aspirations within the rapidly evolving AI landscape. xAI, founded in 2022, is shrouded in some secrecy. Its mission statement emphasises developing “beneficial” and “safe” artificial intelligence, leaving the specific applications and technologies somewhat ambiguous. One of the first offerings from xAI has been Grok. Grok is an AI chatbot developed by xAI, Elon Musk's AI company . Launched in November 2023, it's still in its early stages and currently exclusive to verified users of X’s Premium+ subscription service. More power to Grok? Grok's unique selling point is its personality. Unlike many chatbots that strive for objectivity and neutrality, Grok is designed to be ""witty"" and even ""rebellious."" This means it can engage in playful banter, express opinions, and even tackle ""spicy"" topics that other AI systems might avoid. “Grok is designed to answer questions with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak, so please don’t use it if you hate humour!” X.AI wrote on its website, adding, “It will also answer spicy questions that are rejected by most other AI systems.” Grok is built on large language models (LLMs), similar to those used by Google's Bard or OpenAI 's ChatGPT. This allows it to process information and respond to questions in a comprehensive and informative way. However, it also gives Grok the ability to generate creative text formats, like poems, scripts, and even code. What also works in favour of Grok is that it will have access to all of Twitter — now known as X — data. It will compete against the likes of ChatGPT and Google Bard among other chatbots.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/elon-musks-1-billion-push-to-compete-against-chatgpt/articleshow/105778228.cms

2023-12-06,"Thanks to Gen AI, no one’s job will be the same anymore",TNN,"From enterprises to government agencies to the white-collar worker, no one will be spared the disruption that AI, and generative AI in particular, is ushering in. That was the consensus of experts at the Huddle Global 2023 startup event held in Thiruvananthapuram recently. Ashish Sehdev, VP & markets leader at consulting firm Everest Group , says there are several areas where Gen AI is seeing extensive adoption by enterprises, the first being around knowledge management. “Anywhere you have organisational knowledge or a robust base of knowledge available, whether it is within the employee base, customer base, or within organisation functions like customer service, sales, marketing, or operations, Gen AI is being adopted at scale,” he said. Major areas of adoption, he said, include synthetic data and code generation, summarisation and analytics, and the process discovery space – which refers to a systematic way to identify, map, define, and analyse business processes. Gen AI is seen to excel at automating rote tasks that workers have been diligently doing the same way for years or decades. Which means companies no longer need to hire an army of people to manage their organisations. “Generative AI is minimising the total number of hours that you spend consolidating and making sense of the information that’s already availa ble,” said Abirami Sukumaran, developer advocate at Google Cloud. “Whatever we’ve been doing manually, those become much easier now, be it filling out forms or even things we have been doing on a computer system.” Even government agencies and functionaries, who are notorious for being slow to adopt tech, will be forced to adopt AI just because of the value that these systems can bring, said Nilanjan Chakravortty, deputy general manager of R&D at Hitachi India. “It is still very difficult for citizens to reach out to access government services. So, one idea is to just use chatbots with Gen AI and easily get queries solved online.” Nilanjan said AI in general hold immense scope in smart city functions. “Take Infrastructure, you could look at a bridge’s health using AI and predict when that bridge, if at all, is going to give way. Water management is another area, where you can do demand predictions and accordingly prepare your infrastructure.” Soft skills are crucial Knowing what AI can’t do is as important as knowing what it can. AI systems are horrible when it comes to any task related to critical thinking, creative pursuits, or collaborating with others. What this means, said John Mathew , CEO & co-founder of Riafy Technologies, is that such soft skills are going to be in higher demand the more AI gets adopted in workplaces. “We as humans need to learn more soft skills because AI can’t.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/thanks-to-gen-ai-no-ones-job-will-be-the-same-anymore/articleshow/105773152.cms

Top Picks For You China's navy engaged in 'unsafe' actions, says Australia Australia's PM Anthony Albanese, last month accused a Chinese naval ship of “dangerous, unsafe and unprofessional” behaviour after Australian naval divers were injured by sonar pulses said to have been emitted by a Chinese warship in the international waters off Japan. Earlier, Marles referred to this incident as “unsafe and unprofessional” and told it was raised directly with China. “We have made public our concerns about the behaviour,” he said. “It highlights the need for this arrangement and it highlights the need for speed in this arrangement and I think you can see that speed.” Australia’s planned acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines is the main focus of the Aukus pact. However, the second pillar focuses on advanced technologies. AI technology will be used on systems, including on P-8A Poseidon aircraft to process information from sonobuoys, which detect and transmit underwater data, to improve ""anti-submarine warfare capabilities”, according to a joint statement by the ministers. AI algorithms and machine learning will also be used to “enhance force protection, precision targeting, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance”.

Microsoft president Brad Smith and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have said that it will take many years for the technology to even compete with humans. ‘No probability…’: Smith Smith said there is no chance of super-intelligent artificial intelligence being created within the next 12 months and said that the technology could be decades away. He was referring to OpenAI ’s internal project named Q* (pronounced Q-Star) that led to the company CEO Sam Altman’s ouster last month. It was reported that the breakthrough, which is defined as artificial general intelligence ( AGI ), can surpass humans in most economically valuable tasks. “There's absolutely no probability that you're going to see this so-called AGI, where computers are more powerful than people, in the next 12 months. It's going to take years, if not many decades, but I still think the time to focus on safety is now,” he said. He pointed out that the tech industry needs ‘safety brakes’ just like there are in an elevator so that AI systems always remain under human control. AI will be fairly competitive, says Nvidia CEO Similar thoughts were shared by the Nvidia CEO who said that AI will be ‘fairly competitive’ with humans in five years. Huang highlighted that if AGI can complete tests in a “fairly competitive” way to human intelligence, then “within the next five years, you’re going to see, obviously, AIs that can achieve those tests.” Huang said that back in 2018, he delivered the world's first AI supercomputer to OpenAI after Elon Musk, who was then associated with the company, said, “I want one of those.” Nvidia’s business saw a boom due to the surge in demand for high-powered GPUs that are needed to train AI models and run workloads.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/microsoft-president-brad-smith-nvidia-ceo-may-have-taken-away-humans-ai-fear/articleshow/105659792.cms

2023-11-25,"Liberal media more opposed to AI than conservative media, finds research",PTI,"NEW DELHI: Researchers have found that articles published by the liberal media tend to be more opposed to artificial intelligence (AI) than those by the conservative media . The opposition could arise out of concerns about AI amplifying racial and gender biases in the society, along with income inequity, researchers from the Virginia Tech University, US, said. Considering that media sentiment is indicative of public opinion and can, in turn, impact policymakers' stances, the findings may have important implications for future political discussions around AI, the researchers said. Their work was published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science. They also said that the observed differences in the partisan media's sentiment towards AI may also subsequently lead to differences in the public's sentiment towards AI. ""Media sentiment is a powerful driver of public opinion, and many times policymakers look towards the media to predict public sentiment on contentious issues,"" said Angela Yi, study author and a PhD student in the marketing department of Virginia Tech Pamplin College of Business. For the study, the researchers formed a compilation of over 7,500 articles written on AI from May 2019 to May 2021 by downloading them from various media outlets. They looked for specific keywords in the articles such as ""algorithm"" or ""artificial intelligence"". The articles that the team chose to study were published by a mix of media houses, such as the liberal-leaning The New York Times and The Washington Post, and the conservative-leaning The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post. The researchers analysed the ""emotional tone"" of these articles using an automated text analysis tool. The tool, they said, worked by calculating the difference between the percentage of positive emotion words and the percentage of negative emotion words in a text. Each article was then given a standardised 'emotional tone' measure or score. The researchers said that they were not pronouncing judgements on ""whether the liberal media is acting optimally, or the conservative media is acting optimally"" and that they were taking no stance as to what the ""right way"" to discuss AI should be. ""We are just showing that these differences exist in the media sentiment and that these differences are important to quantify, see, and understand,"" said Shreyans Goenka , a study author and assistant professor of marketing at Virginia Tech Pamplin College of Business. The researchers also examined how media sentiment towards AI changed after George Floyd's death, which happened on May 25, 2020. Floyd, a 46-year-old black American man, was killed in the US city of Minneapolis by Derek Chauvin, a 44-year-old white police officer. ""Since Floyd's death ignited a national conversation about social biases in society, his death heightened social bias concerns in the media,"" said Yi. ""This, in turn, resulted in the media becoming even more negative towards AI in their storytelling,"" said Yi.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/liberal-media-more-opposed-to-ai-than-conservative-media-finds-research/articleshow/105497404.cms
2023-11-25,We are confronted with fundamental questions about ethical treatment of AI: CJI Chandrachud,PTI,"BENGALURU: Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud on Saturday said identity and its recognition by the State plays a crucial part in what resources people get and their ability to express their grievances and demand their rights. Addressing the plenary session of the 36th 'LAWASIA' conference virtually, he spoke on ""Identity, the Individual and the State - New Paths to liberty"". LAWASIA is a regional association of lawyers, judges, jurists and legal organisations, which advocates for the interests and concerns of the Asia Pacific legal progression. Noting that liberty is the ability to make choices for oneself and change our course of life, the Chief Justice said identity intersects with the person's agency and life choices. ""As lawyers, we are constantly confronted with this intersection and the role of the State to limit or expand the life opportunities of the people. While the relationship between the state and liberty has been understood widely, the task of establishing and explaining the relationship between identity and liberty is incomplete,"" he said. Traditionally, liberty has been understood as the absence of State interference in a person's right to make choices. However, contemporary scholars have come to the conclusion that the role of the State in perpetuating social prejudices and hierarchies cannot be ignored, Chief Justice Chandrachud said. ""In effect, whether the state does not intervene, it automatically allows communities with social and economic capital to exercise dominance over communities who have been historically marginalised."" He also said people who face marginalisation because of their caste, race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation will always face oppression in a traditional, liberal paradigm. This empowers the socially dominant. Citing English philosopher John Stuart Mill's book on Liberty published in 1859, he said the author discussed the historical struggle between liberty and authority describing the tyranny of the government which in his view needs to be controlled by the liberty of citizens. Mill devised this control of authority into two mechanisms. Firstly, necessity rights belonging to the citizens and secondly that there must be constitutional checks for the community to consent to the impacts of the governing path, according to him. The idea of liberty, the Chief Justice said, can be summarised in the following phrase: ""Your right to swing your fist ends where my nose begins.” He also spoke how in the digital age ""we are faced with several fascinating aspects of Artificial Intelligence . ""There is a complex interplay between Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) and personhood where we find ourselves navigating uncharted territories that demand both philosophical reflection and practical considerations."" In contemplating the intersection of AI and personhood, ""we are confronted with fundamental questions about the ethical treatment of these technologies...."" He cited an example of a human robot (Sophia) which was granted citizenship (in Saudi Arabia) and said, ""We must reflect on whether all humans who live, breathe and walk are entitled to personhood and citizenship based on their identity."" The Chief Justice also stressed: ""We must broaden our perspectives. The notion of popular sovereignty, for example, inherently demands the inclusion of pluralism and diversity at its core."" In India, he said, affirmative action has been prescribed and even mandated by the Constitution of India in the context of Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes, and Backward Classes, he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-are-confronted-with-fundamental-questions-about-ethical-treatment-of-ai-cji-chandrachud/articleshow/105493413.cms
2023-11-25,Tech push: Ayodhya to emerge as first Vedic city with AI solutions,TNN,"The daily count of visitors to the temple town is expected to go up soon after the Ram temple opens doors for devotees from January next year LUCKNOW: Ayodhya will be the first Vedic sustainable city powered by artificial intelligence . The Ayodhya Development Authority has signed an MoU with a Delhi-based firm to create a Vedic sustainable city index platform. The objective of the platform would be decision-making to implement sustainable practices while managing the growing needs of the local population. The Yogi government has already constituted a special board (Ayodhya Dham Teertha Vikas Parishad) earlier this month to fast-track overall development of the city through sustainable measures. Officials said data analytics solutions are going to be provided by a private company to the local development authority and municipal corporation to control air, water and environmental pollution while executing infrastructure projects on the ground. The daily count of visitors to the temple town is expected to go up soon after the Ram temple opens doors for devotees from January next year. The NCR-based private company, Arahas Technologies Pvt Ltd, is known for developing geospatial IT and AI-based platforms to put in place advanced sustainability goals. The local development authority wants to integrate advanced algorithms to incorporate in-depth analysis of extensive datasets, environmental insights, societal and economic dynamics prevailing in Ayodhya city. Vice-chairman of the authority, Vishal Singh, said that the real-time metrics of the platform would empower the authority to set benchmarks, list out milestones, formulate the strategy, introduce the policy goals and monitor overall progress of the projects being deployed through the platform. The estimated population of the Ayodhya-Faizabad twin cities is about 24.7 lakh at present while at least 35,000 to 50,000 visitors come to the city daily. Since the daily count of visitors is expected to go up significantly in the coming days, immediate steps have to be taken to make the city self-sustainable through various technology interventions and give shape to the idea of turning temple town into a Vedic city . The Vedic sustainable index would unveil a visionary future blending tradition with modernity, said another officer. “Ayodhya Development Authority envisions the development of a city rooted in Vedic principles, nurturing the well-being of its inhabitants, fostering environmental stewardship, and embodying United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Through the Vedic sustainable city index, Ayodhya aspires to become the first temple town which would proactively report its sustainability indices and serve as a model to set the stage for a thriving and resilient urban future,” said Singh. “The objective is to create a model city that is able to handle, process and recycle the waste that is being generated and a centralised dashboard which will flag off the concerns in this domain is going to be helpful for the local authorities,” added Singh. CEO of Arahas Technologies Pvt Ltd, Saurabh Rai, said that through the index, Ayodhya will be ready to compete with global cities and the solution will lead the way for other urban local bodies.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/ayodhya-vedic-city-ai-solutions/articleshow/105487559.cms

2023-11-24,"Law to regulate deepfake manipulation coming very soon, with penalties for creators and platforms: Vaishnaw",Pankaj Doval,"NEW DELHI: Expressing serious concern over the dangers from deepfake , in the face of growing instances where the face or body of an individual has been digitally altered and tampered with for malicious intent through the use of AI, the government on Thursday promised a regulation on the matter very soon and directed social media and tech companies to take immediate steps against the menace, or be prepared to face penal action. IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw met representatives from top social media companies such as Google, Meta and X, apart from industry association Nasscom, and asked them to immediately take steps to identify such content which has been a matter of concern across the world. Vaishnaw said the government will look at measures to expose synthetic content, including through watermarking of AI-generated videos, deepfake detection, and rules against data bias. ""Deepfakes have emerged as a new threat to democracy. These (can) weaken trust in society and its institutions,"" Vaishnaw said after meeting the stakeholders that also included professionals from the field of artificial intelligence (AI). ""We will start drafting the regulations today itself and within a very short timeframe, we will have a separate regulation for deepfakes,"" he said. The government intends to come out with actionable items in four key areas -- detection of deepfakes; preventing the spread of such content; strengthening reporting mechanisms; and spreading awareness on the issue. ""There is a need to take steps on this at the earliest whether they are legal, regulatory or technical. We need to take all sorts of steps.” Asked if there will be a change in the existing IT rules or a new law may be drafted, he said, ""We can bring this in the form of making amendments to the existing rules, or create new rules, or we can bring a new law.” On penalties, the Minister said, “When we will draft the regulation, we will also be looking at penalties on both the person who has uploaded or created a deepfake video, and also against the platform.” Vaishnaw said deepfake advertisements or misleading promotions are a threat that Indian society is facing currently. ""The use of social media ensures that deepfakes can spread rapidly in a more significant manner without any check and go viral. This is why we need to take urgent steps to strengthen trust in society and our democracy.” Deepfakes shot into prominence after actor Rashmika Mandanna's digitally-created face was found to have been used in an embarrassing video earlier this month. Some other celebrities including Katrina Kaif and Kajol were also reported to be victims of deepfake. Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also warned about the threat deepfakes pose. On Saturday, Vaishnaw had warned that social media platforms would lose the immunity they enjoy under the 'safe harbour' clause in the IT Act if they fail to take measures against deepfakes. The next meeting on the matter will be held in the first week of December. ""All the companies have shared our concern. They understand that this is not free speech, that this is something very harmful... they have understood the need for much heavier regulation.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/law-to-regulate-deepfake-manipulation-coming-very-soon-with-penalties-for-creators-and-platforms-vaishnaw/articleshow/105461660.cms
2023-11-24,TikTok parent company launches ChatGPT-like tool for office workers,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Joining the generative AI race is ByteDance , the parent company of TikTok , which has unveiled a ChatGPT-like tool specifically designed for office workers. According to a report by South Morning China Post, the generative AI tool will be integrated into its popular Feishu enterprise collaboration platform The Feishu chatbot, dubbed Feishu Intelligent Buddy , will leverage the power of artificial intelligence to seamlessly integrate into the daily workflow of users. With its ability to understand natural language and engage in contextual conversations, the chatbot will serve as a versatile virtual assistant , capable of handling a wide range of tasks, from scheduling meetings and taking notes to summarizing documents and providing translations. “We’ve seen AI is changing the way we work and push for the evolution of our organisations,” Feishu CEO Xie Xin said during the announcement. “It’s critical for entrepreneurs to ensure their companies can quickly adapt to and get ready for the fast-moving era of artificial intelligence.” This chatbot is expected to enhance productivity and streamline communication within organisations. By automating routine tasks and providing real-time support, Feishu AI Assistant will free up employees' time, allowing them to focus on higher-value initiatives, noted the company. “The best way to introduce large language models should be like the addition of an intelligent and capable person,” Xie was quoted as saying in the report. “And this person will not only perform multiple tasks but also will keep gaining new abilities.” According to Xie, customers can select their preferred Language Model (LLM) for the Feishu assistant. The current options include models from MiniMax , a unicorn supported by Tencent, Zhipu AI, backed by the state, and Baichuan, a startup founded by Wang Xiaochuan, the creator of Sogou.

2023-11-23,What does Sam Altman's firing — and quick reinstatement — mean for the future of AI?,AP,"NEW YORK: It's been quite a week for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI — and co-founder Sam Altman . Altman, who helped start OpenAI as a nonprofit research lab back in 2015, was removed as CEO Friday in a sudden and mostly unexplained exit that stunned the industry. And while his chief executive title was swiftly reinstated just days later, a lot of questions are still up in the air. If you're just catching up on the OpenAI saga and what's at stake for the artificial intelligence space as a whole, you've come to the right place. Here's a rundown of what you need to know. Who is Sam Altman and how did he rise to fame? Altman is co-founder of OpenAI, the San Francisco-based company behind ChatGPT (yes, the chatbot that's seemingly everywhere today — from schools to health care ). The explosion of ChatGPT since its arrival one year ago propelled Altman into the spotlight of the rapid commercialization of generative AI — which can produce novel imagery, passages of text and other media. And as he became Silicon Valley's most sought-after voice on the promise and potential dangers of this technology, Altman helped transform OpenAI into a world-renowned startup. But his position at OpenAI hit some rocky turns in a whirlwind that was the past week. Altman was fired as CEO Friday — and days later, he was back on the job with a new board of directors. Within that time, Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and has rights to its existing technology, helped drive Altman's return, quickly hiring him as well as another OpenAI co-founder and former president, Greg Brockman, who quit in protest after the CEO's ousting. Meanwhile, hundreds of OpenAI employees threatened to resign. Both Altman and Brockman celebrated their returns to the company in posts on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, early Wednesday. Why does his removal — and reinstatement — matter? There's a lot that remains unknown about Altman's initial ousting. Friday's announcement said he was “not consistently candid in his communications” with the then-board of directors, which refused to provide more specific details. Regardless, the news sent shockwaves throughout the AI world — and, because OpenAI and Altman are such leading players in this space, may raise trust concerns around a burgeoning technology that many people still have questions about. “The OpenAI episode shows how fragile the AI ecosystem is right now, including addressing AI's risks ,” said Johann Laux, an expert at the Oxford Internet Institute focusing on human oversight of artificial intelligence. The turmoil also accentuated the differences between Altman and members of the company's previous board, who have expressed various views on the safety risks posed by AI as the technology advances. Multiple experts add that this drama highlights how it should be governments — and not big tech companies — that should be calling the shots on AI regulation, particularly for fast-evolving technologies like generative AI. “The events of the last few days have not only jeopardized OpenAI's attempt to introduce more ethical corporate governance in the management of their company, but it also shows that corporate governance alone, even when well-intended, can easily end up cannibalized by other corporate's dynamics and interests,” said Enza Iannopollo, principal analyst at Forrester. The lesson, Iannopollo said, is that companies can't alone deliver the level of safety and trust in AI that society needs. “Rules and guardrails, designed with companies and enforced by regulators with rigor, are crucial if we are to benefit from AI,” he added. What is generative AI? How is it being regulated? Unlike traditional AI, which processes data and completes tasks using predetermined rules, generative AI (including chatbots like ChatGPT) can create something new. Tech companies are still leading the show when it comes to governing AI and its risks, while governments around the world work to catch up. In the European Union, negotiators are putting the final touches on what's expected to be the world's first comprehensive AI regulations. But they've reportedly been bogged down over whether and how to include the most contentious and revolutionary AI products, the commercialized large-language models that underpin generative AI systems including ChatGPT. Chatbots were barely mentioned when Brussels first laid out its initial draft legislation in 2021, which focused on AI with specific uses. But officials have been racing to figure out how to incorporate these systems, also known as foundation models, into the final version. Meanwhile, in the U.S., President Joe Biden signed an ambitious executive order last month seeking to balance the needs of cutting-edge technology companies with national security and consumer rights. The order — which will likely need to be augmented by congressional action — is an initial step that is meant to ensure that AI is trustworthy and helpful, rather than deceptive and destructive. It seeks to steer how AI is developed so that companies can profit without putting public safety in jeopardy.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/what-does-sam-altmans-firing-and-quick-reinstatement-mean-for-the-future-of-ai/articleshow/105432765.cms
2023-11-23,"With initial $25m, PM proposes a fund for DPI in Global South",TNN,"Times News Network New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday proposed the setting up of a Social Impact Fund to implement digital public infrastructure (DPI) in countries of the Global South and called for global regulations on artificial intelligence (AI) to make it safe for society. “To implement DPI in countries of the Global South, I propose to establish a Social Impact Fund. On behalf of India, I also announce an initial amount of $25 million for this. I hope that all of you will join this initiative,” the PM said in his opening remarks at the virtual G20 summit hosted by India. He said the decision at the G20 summit in September to create a DPI repository has been implemented and over 50 DPIs from 16 countries have been included in it. India had projected its success with DPI such as Aadhaar, UPI, Co-Win and others during its presidency of the G20 and proposed to share its experience with other countries, particularly in the Global South. Calling for using technology safely in the age of AI, the PM said there is an increasing concern all over the world about the negative use of AI. “India has a clear thinking that we should work together on the global regulation of AI. Understanding the seriousness of deepfakes, how dangerous it is for society and for an individual, we have to move forward. We want AI to reach people and it must be safe for society,” said Modi, reiterating his concern over deepfakes and its impact on people and society. He said India is organising the Global AI partnership summit and sought cooperation of G20 members. Modi cited the success of the aspirational districts programme as an example of the progress of sustainable development goals (SDGs) at the local level and urged the G20 members to assess the plan. “I invite the G20 countries, the Global South, to study the aspirational district programme. You will see how this one campaign has helped India change the lives of 25 crore people,” said the PM. The PM said that through the Global Biofuels Alliance launched during the G20 Leaders’ Summit in Delhi, India is promoting the development of alternative fuels along with reducing carbon. “G20 has recognised mission LiFE — lifestyle for environment for a pro-planet approach. There has been a call to triple the use of renewable energy by 2030... The need to take climate finance from billions to trillions has been recognised. In a few days, during COP-28 being held in UAE, concrete steps need to be taken on all these initiatives,” said the PM. India had managed to secure a rare consensus against the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine war that had created a deep divide in the group of developed and emerging economies. The PM said a new working group on women empowerment has also been formed. India had pushed for women-led development as a key theme under its presidency.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/pm-modi-fund-dpi-global-south/articleshow/105429277.cms

2023-11-21,US envoy pitches for deeper Indo-US conversations on AI regulatory framework,PTI,"NEW DELHI: US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti on Monday made a strong pitch for ""deeper conversations"" between New Delhi and Washington on a regulatory framework on artificial intelligence, saying it could be an example of ""multiplicative relationship"" between the two democracies. In an interactive session organised by Observer Research Foundation, Garcetti stressed on the need to ""get in front"" of artificial intelligence (AI) to avoid facing catastrophic consequences. He made it clear that while there had been deep conversations on the issue with India, there was no formal proposal yet from either side. Garcetti noted that US president Joe Biden had spoken strongly on the issue. Last month, Biden issued an executive order that required AI manufacturers to provide the federal government with an assessment of their applications' vulnerability to cyberattacks , the data used to train and test the AI and its performance measurements. ""If we don't get in front of AI, the consequences, even if it is a small percentage of likelihood, of something catastrophic happening with our official intelligence could be sooner than we believe,"" Garcetti said. On the India-US 2+2 dialogue last week, Garcetti said the two sides took important steps towards strengthening the major defence partnership which continues to grow and increasing the acceleration seen through initiatives such as the US-India roadmap in industrial cooperation and defence. He stressed that New Delhi and Washington should deepen their Artificial Intelligence (AI) conversation. He pitched for India-US collaboration and cooperation in emerging domains. ""...we sometimes just focus on weapons and what is being sold, or potentially co-developed, but the operational level of our militaries...is as critical as any equipment,"" he said. He also said the countries should ""discuss ways to deepen our science and our technology partnerships to harness technology for the global good instead of technology that harms us and divides us.""

The European Commission, the European Parliament and the EU Council are negotiating how the bloc should position itself. In June, the European Parliament presented an ""AI Act"" designed to contain the risks of AI applications and avoid discriminatory effects, while harnessing the innovative power of AI. During the discussions, the European Parliament proposed that the code of conduct should initially only be binding for major AI providers, which are primarily from the U.S. The three EU governments have said this apparent competitive advantage for smaller European providers could have the drawback of reducing trust in them and of resulting in fewer customers. The rules of conduct and transparency should therefore be binding for everyone, they said. Initially, no sanctions should be imposed, according to the paper. If violations of the code of conduct are identified after a certain period of time, however, a system of sanctions could be set up. In future, a European authority would monitor compliance with the standards, the paper said. Germany's Economy Ministry, which is in charge of the topic together with the Ministry of Digital Affairs, said laws and state control should not regulate AI itself, but rather its application. Digital Affairs Minister Volker Wissing told Reuters he was very pleased an agreement had been reached with France and Germany to limit only the use of AI. ""We need to regulate the applications and not the technology if we want to play in the top AI league worldwide,"" Wissing said. State Secretary for Economic Affairs Franziska Brantner told Reuters it was crucial to harness the opportunities and limit the risks. ""We have developed a proposal that can ensure a balance between both objectives in a technological and legal terrain that has not yet been defined,"" Brantner said. As governments around the world seek to capture the economic benefits of AI, Britain in November hosted its first AI safety summit. The German government is hosting a digital summit in Jena, in the state of Thuringia, on Monday and Tuesday that will bring together representatives from politics, business and science. Issues surrounding AI will also be on the agenda when the German and Italian governments hold talks in Berlin on Wednesday.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/germany-france-and-italy-reach-agreement-on-future-ai-regulation/articleshow/105332029.cms
2023-11-20,UK PM Rishi Sunak urges world to use AI and science to end malnutrition,AP,"LONDON: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Monday that the UK is setting up a new science initiative to help develop flood-tolerant rice, disease-resistant wheat and other crops that are more resilient to climate change. Sunak was joined by ministers, diplomats and philanthropists from about 20 countries at a one-day Global Food Security Summit in London, where he urged world leaders to harness artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technology to end malnutrition around the globe. Sunak told delegates that a ""fundamental shift"" is needed to confront a food-security crisis that is being worsened by climate change. He focused on the role of science and said the UK would set up a ""virtual science hub"" linking international researchers working on more resilient crops. The UK hub will be part of a global research partnership known as CGIAR. ""Climate change, conflict and population rise mean ever greater challenges to food supplies,"" Sunak said. ""So we need a fundamental shift in the way we approach food security, with a focus on long-term solutions to stop food crises before they start. And we need to harness the full power of science and technology to ensure supplies are resilient to threats like conflict, drought and floods."" The event was co-hosted by Somalia and the United Arab Emirates alongside the Children's Investment Fund Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The conference venue was picketed by activists from Medical Aid for Palestinians calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war to get urgently needed food and humanitarian aid into Gaza. ""It is good that they are talking about addressing food and security in the world. But if they're going to do that seriously, they cannot ignore the situation in Gaza, where 2.2 million people are at risk of starvation,"" said the group's chief executive, Melanie Ward. ""Because of the siege that's been imposed on Gaza, the amount of aid that's gotten in the last month is only enough for about two normal days in Gaza. So less than 10% of the food needed to keep people in Gaza alive is actually getting in."" Like the United States, the UK has not called for a cease-fire, but Sunak urged Israel to agree to ""urgent and substantive humanitarian pauses"" to get in food, fuel and medicine.

2023-11-20,"Meta disbands its Responsible AI group, here’s why",TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Meta , the parent company of Facebook , has disbanded its Responsible AI (RAI) division, which was dedicated to regulating the safety of its artificial intelligence projects during development and deployment. According to multiple online reports, most of the RAI team members have been reassigned to Meta's Generative AI product division, as reported by The Information, while some have been moved to the AI Infrastructure team. Meta's Generative AI team was established in February as part of the company's efforts to keep up with the AI race, as other tech companies have invested heavily in machine learning development. The division focuses on developing products that mimic human-made versions, generating language and images. Even though RAI employees have been dispersed throughout the organisation, The company says that it will continue to prioritise and invest in the safe and responsible development of AI. Despite the team's restructuring, its members will still provide support for cross-Meta efforts related to responsible AI development and usage. ""We are committed to prioritising and investing in the safe and responsible development of AI,"" a Meta spokesperson said. Earlier this year, too, the RAI team underwent a restructuring process that included layoffs, leaving it as a ""shell of a team,"" according to Business Insider. The report also stated that the RAI team had minimal autonomy and that implementing its initiatives required lengthy negotiations with stakeholders. Meta has always said that it wants to develop AI responsibly, though now there is no team dedicated to it. The company, on its page, lists the pillars of responsible AI, which include accountability, transparency, safety, and privacy, among others. As the use of AI continues to increase, regulators and officials have been scrutinising the companies, thus the safety of AI has become a top priority for companies. The US government directed government agencies to create safety guidelines for AI. Meanwhile, the European Union has released its own set of AI principles.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/meta-disbands-its-responsible-ai-group-heres-why/articleshow/105357676.cms

2023-11-19,"Sacked OpenAI CEO Sam Altman discusses possible return, mulls new AI venture",TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"NEW DELHI: A day after being sacked as CEO of OpenAI , Sam Altman has been mulling a possible return to the company behind the ChatGPT bot, even as he considers launching a new artificial intelligence (AI) venture, a person briefed on the matter told a news agency Reuters. Altman, who ouster took the tech world by surprise, was talking with OpenAI executives about improving the company's governance structure. He also discussed with some ""core OpenAI researchers and others loyal to Altman how they could start a new AI company "", the person told the news agency. The prospects for a comeback or a relaunch for Altman, widely regarded as a prominent figure in generative AI, are uncertain, according to an anonymous source who requested confidentiality as they were not authorized to speak on behalf of the parties involved. Investors in OpenAI, Microsoft being its major supporter, are in talks about damage control measures. This includes the possibility of urging the board to reinstate Altman as CEO, as there are concerns of a potential ""mass exodus of talent"" without his leadership, reported the agency. Vinod Khosla, founder of Khosla Ventures, and an early supporter of OpenAI, expressed a desire to see Altman return to OpenAI. In a post on X on Saturday, Khosla mentioned that the fund would support Altman in his future endeavours regardless of the outcome at OpenAI. Microsoft, which reportedly owns 49% of the company, declined to comment. Sam Altman, who is considered by many as the poster boy of the new wave of AI, was replaced as CEO by the OpenAI board. Altman was replaced by the company’s chief technology officer Mira Murati. “Mr. Altman’s departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities. The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI,” the board said in a statement. OpenAI’s board of directors consists of OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, independent directors Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo, technology entrepreneur Tasha McCauley, and Georgetown Center for Security and Emerging Technology’s Helen Toner. Following the sacking, strong emotions were evident on Saturday among current and former employees who were upset by Altman's dismissal. Concerns mounted about the potential impact of the abrupt management upheaval on an upcoming $86 billion share sale. Co-founded by billionaire Elon Musk, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT on November 30 last year, triggering a worldwide sensation around generative AI technology. Rapidly becoming the fastest-growing software application globally, it spurred a wave of investments and announcements spanning various industries. The efforts were aimed at leveraging AI for improvements in areas ranging from financial services and healthcare to entertainment and media.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sacked-openai-ceo-sam-altman-discusses-possible-return-mulls-new-ai-venture/articleshow/105336538.cms
2023-11-18,"Indian undergraduates want AI tools training within courses, new global study finds",PTI,"LONDON: A majority of Indian undergraduates want their course curriculum to include training in artificial intelligence (AI) tools relevant to their future careers , the Global Student Survey 2023 of students from across 15 countries has found. As many as 83 per cent of Indian students surveyed for the Chegg.Org annual analysis released here this week wanted to incorporate AI in their learning, the second highest of all countries after Kenya at 84 per cent. In addition, 46 per cent of these Indian students also felt their degree would be more useful in an AI-assisted workplace, the third highest of all countries after Kenya (53 per cent) and Saudi Arabia (48 per cent). At the same time, 44 per cent of Indian undergraduates say they have used Generative AI (GenAI) - or AI capable of generating text, images, or other media, using generative models - for their university studies, higher than the global average of 40 per cent. While Indian students appear to view GenAI as a helpful learning support tool, they still see room for improvement, with 49 per cent calling for the involvement of human expertise in generating answers and 28 per cent of those having tried it concerned about receiving incorrect or inaccurate information. ""Although students are starting to adopt GenAI to support their learning, it's clear they see room for improvement,"" said Heather Hatlo Porter, Head of Chegg.org and Chief Communications Officer of edtech firm Chegg. ""Students want GenAI learning tools that provide accurate, reliable study support. Crucially, according to our survey, a top priority among all those surveyed in India was the involvement of human expertise. An analysis of our internal research found that students are mainly using GenAI for writing tasks, and are not yet fully leveraging the technology for STEM subjects,"" she said. The new findings are published by Chegg.org, the non-profit arm of Chegg, based on opinion polling by Yonder Consulting of over 11,000 undergraduate students aged 18-21 years across 15 countries, including 1,016 students in India. Chegg.org said its latest survey is the most comprehensive up-to-date survey of the lives, hopes and concerns of undergraduate students throughout the world as they enter the age of AI. Questions in the survey covered students' views on learning in the age of AI, skills and careers, and their health, wellbeing and social attitudes. Among the 44 per cent of Indian students who have used Gen AI in their studies, 60 per cent say it helps them learn faster, 55 per cent say it allows them more creative use of learning, while 51 per cent say it frees up their time. A majority (64 per cent) of the 44 per cent of students who say they have used GenAI for their studies said they did so to understand a concept or a subject, the second highest percentage for this option after Australia (72 per cent). The survey shows that over three-quarters (78 per cent) of Indian students believe universities should change the way they assess students, considering the availability of GenAI tools, the third highest to say so after Kenya (82 per cent) and Indonesia (79 per cent). Among this cohort, 59 per cent said there should be better guidance on the acceptable use of GenAI in assessments, while 37 per cent said there should be more oral assessments, such as presentations or speaking exams. Over half (58 per cent) of all Indian students surveyed said colleges and universities should promote the use of GenAI tools for assessed work, the fifth highest out of all the countries for this option after Kenya (72 per cent), Saudi Arabia (66 per cent), Turkiye (63 per cent), and Mexico (61 per cent).

2023-11-18,Deepfakes can create crisis in diverse society like ours: PM Modi,Diwakar&Akhilesh Singh,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday flagged the dangers of 'deepfakes' and said the developers of artificial intelligence should consider tagging their products to caution people about AI-enabled deception . ""A new crisis is emerging due to deepfakes produced through artificial intelligence. We have a big section that does not have the wherewithal to verify their genuineness and there lies the concern,"" Modi said, adding that he had raised the matter with people in the AI industry . Top Picks For You 1. Why PM is concerned about deepfakes Rashmika video reveals how scary AI deepfakery can be ""I suggested to them that they should consider tagging AI-generated content that is vulnerable to misuse,"" PM Modi said in a likely reference to his meeting with Sam Altman, the founder of Open AI and the developer of ChatGPT, in June. The conversation had seen Modi pitching for soft touch regulation of the AI industry. Open AI, along with other artificial intelligence biggies like Alphabet and Meta, have been watermarking their AI-generated content and what started as voluntary pledges have turned into legal obligation by an executive order of the US President. Interestingly, the Prime Minister cited a deepfake video showing him participating in a garba dance during Navratri festivities that has gone viral. ""They have done it rather well. It is a different thing that I have not played garba for long. I used to play garba during my childhood, and I was good at it. But I stopped playing after my school. However, thanks to artificial intelligence, I can be playing garba, and many of my own followers are forwarding the clip,"" he said. In a deepfake video or photo, a person's face or other body parts are super imposed on someone else's to pass it off as authentic. A few celebrities like Rashmika Mandanna have recently fallen victim to deepfake. The proliferation of deepfake videos on social media has raised significant concerns, prompting the government to issue comprehensive guidelines to social media companies to address identification and removal of misleading and deepfake videos and photographs. The Prime Minister said that in a diverse society like India, deepfakes could cause a big crisis and could spread disaffection among people. ""Since our Independence, there is a legacy of trust about the media and people start believing that there might be some truth. Therefore, we are heading towards a serious crisis, as by the time the truth comes out, it becomes too late,"" Prime Minister Modi said and suggested that the media could play a bigger role and promptly highlight the truth. The Prime Minister recalled his meeting with a group of experts from ChatGPT and said they were equally concerned and were looking at containing the technology's misuse. ""I suggested that just like there is a provision of a disclaimer that cigarettes are hazardous for health, in the same way, there should be prompt mention of 'deepfake',"" the PM added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/deepfakes-can-create-crisis-in-diverse-society-like-ours-pm-modi/articleshow/105300063.cms
2023-11-18,'Not candid in his communications': Why OpenAI fired CEO Sam Altman,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Sam Altman, the co-founder and CEO of OpenAI , was fired from his position by the board of the organization. The primary reason cited for his removal was a lack of consistent candor in his communications with the board members, which was seen as hindering their ability to effectively exercise their responsibilities. This decision was the outcome of a thorough review process by the board, which ultimately led to the loss of confidence in Altman's ability to continue leading OpenAI. “The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI,” the artificial intelligence company said in a statement . Top Picks For You OpenAI CEO’s ouster followed debates between Sam Altman, board In ousting CEO Sam Altman, ChatGPT loses its best fundraiser “Mr Altman’s departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities,” the board’s statement said. In the wake of Altman's exit, Mira Murati, OpenAI's CTO, will serve as the interim CEO . She has been a key figure in the company's leadership for five years. Altman responded positively on social media, expressing his fondness for his time at OpenAI and the team he worked with. Altman posted on X: “i loved my time at openai. it was transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit. most of all i loved working with such talented people. will have more to say about what’s next later.” But Altman's dismissal caught the tech world by surprise, with rumors rife on social media as to the cause of the sudden sacking. According to a Bloomberg report, Altman’s ambitions may have also played a role in his departure. He has been actively seeking to secure funding in the range of several billion dollars from sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East. This funding is intended for launching a startup focused on AI chips, aiming to rival those produced by Nvidia Corp. Furthermore, Altman has been engaging with Masayoshi Son, the chairman of SoftBank Group Corp, to garner a substantial investment for a new venture. This venture, involving AI-focused hardware, is planned in collaboration with Jony Ive, a former designer at Apple, the Bloomberg report said. Analysts rushed to interpret the reasons and implications of the abrupt removal of 38-year-old Sam Altman, a former Stanford University student, entrepreneur, and software developer. ""It sounded as though there were some ethical concerns which pushed the board to do something,"" Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi told AFP. What's the importance of regulating AI?: Times of India's Samir Jain in conversation with Sam Altman ""If he is being ousted because of ethical concerns, that is only going to be good for the company."" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believed that OpenAI's momentum is unlikely to be slowed by Altman's firing. ""Altman out as CEO of OpenAI is a shocker but ultimately Microsoft will just have more control of the situation,"" Ives said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""We see little concern going forward with him gone,"" Ives added.

He called the AI-powered technological feature ""problematic"" and urged the media to play an active role in educating the public about the potential risks associated with it. Deepfakes use a form of artificial intelligence called deep learning to make manipulated images or videos of real people, making it appear as though the person in the video is saying or doing something they never did. Recently, deepfake videos with morphed faces of actors Rashmika Mandanna, Katrina Kaif and Kajol surfaced on social media, sparking major concerns and drawing outrage from people.

2023-11-16,The AI fraudsters' playbook: How artificial intelligence is changing the face of cyber frauds,Neha Borkar,"In today's world of advanced technology, cyber fraudsters are getting smarter by using Artificial Intelligence to create tricky and fast frauds. These AI-powered scams are tough to solve and can lead to huge money loss, harm reputations, and invade privacy. The case gets more complicated when the fraudsters use AI to steal people's money. Here are some ways through which fraudsters are trying ways to trap innocent people by playing with their trust and emotions- 1.The Credible AI Voice Cloning fraud Imagine you're busy with a work project, and you get a call from an unknown number. It's someone you know, claiming they left their phone and need your help. They say their online bank account is having technical issues, and they've sent money to your account. They ask you to transfer it to another account, providing the details. The voice sounds just like your loved one, so you don't doubt it. You follow the request, only to find out later that it was actually a carefully created fake call using AI. These fraudsters are using advanced technology to imitate our voices and take advantage of our trust to manipulate us. This highlights the growing challenge to our digital safety from the combination of AI and malicious intent. As these techniques improve, it's important for us to stay alert and informed to safeguard ourselves. How are fraudsters doing this? Well, the fraudsters pose as insurance agents and make random calls to people offering policies, loans, etc. While people dismiss the calls by having minimal conversations, the fraudsters still record the call. Then, with the help of AI tools, they replicate the victim's voice and mimic their voice tone and patterns. Therefore, it's necessary to double-check messages and confirm on calls about such messages. Do not fall prey to urgency, as fraudsters are riding on this hurry. 2. The curious case of Deep Fakes In Kerala, a 73-year-old gentleman found himself in a deepfake scheme when he received a call from an individual pretending to be his former colleague, appealing for funds. Leveraging deepfake technology, the fraudster created a video call where the impersonator's appearance and voice matched the victim's former associate. Unfortunately, the victim fell prey to the deception and transferred Rs 40,000 into the fraudster's account. A deepfake, a form of media deception, is an altered video, audio, or image displaying an individual or occurrence that did not occur. These fake media productions rely on a combination of artificial intelligence and machine learning methodologies to craft believable imitations of people and fabricate authentic events. The method includes training algorithms using many pictures of a person, enabling AI to understand and copy their facial expressions, voice, and behaviour. Additionally, AI can edit videos or audio by smoothly replacing faces or voices, creating a believable result. 3. The enticing AI phishing frauds Fraudsters are making it challenging to catch phishing emails or messages through grammatical errors and suspicious language. Now, they have found an evolved way for their modus operandi. They are turning to Generative AI software for email copies. The chatbot is helping users come up with immaculate copies that can make anything believable. These tools have dramatically boosted fraudsters' written communication skills, where they churn out copies to trick readers into falling for their schemes. So, there are higher chances of people falling for frauds easily. It's time to stay well-informed and vigilant against these deceptions. Here's how to avoid being targeted by AI-based online frauds – 1. Create a 'safe word' to circulate in your family Given the fraudsters’ abilities to recreate anybody's voice, verifying the caller's identity is important. Create a code, a safe word for family and friends to confirm their identity, next time you feel like something's fishy. Do not put the safe word on WhatsApp groups or circulate it outside your close circle. 2. Avoid publicly sharing your videos, images Keeping your social media profile private is advantageous, as strangers cannot view your pictures, videos, etc. Avoid publicly sharing your pictures and videos, as they can be used to create your deep fakes. 3. Avoid chatting with suspicious AI bots Beware of fraud AI bots requesting unnecessary or irrelevant personal information during interactions. Always ensure to verify the identity of the individual you are communicating with before sharing sensitive details such as login credentials or financial and personal information. 4. Keep a close watch on what you click An offer for a smartphone at 70% off or a TV at 50% off looks too good to be true?

2023-11-16,The AI of war: Computers and autonomous killing,AFP,"SAN FRANCISCO: Like gunpowder and the atomic bomb, artificial intelligence (AI) has the capacity to revolutionise warfare, analysts say, making human disputes unimaginably different -- and a lot more deadly. Ahead of a summit between China's Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden, there had been suggestions that the two men would agree to ban lethal autonomous weapons . The meeting appeared to produce no such accord, but experts say it's a vital topic that is already altering armed conflict -- and switching up the competition for global supremacy. Observers say Beijing is massively investing in AI, to the point where it may soon be able to change the balance of power in the Asia-Pacific, and perhaps beyond. And that has profound implications for a world order that has long been dominated by the United States. ""This is not about the anxiety of no longer being the dominant power in the world; it is about the risks of living in a world in which the Chinese Communist Party becomes the dominant power,"" said a report by a panel of experts led by former Google president Eric Schmidt. Here are some of the possible applications of AI in the art of warfare. Robots, drones, torpedoes... all kinds of weapons can be transformed into autonomous systems, thanks to sophisticated sensors governed by AI algorithms that allow a computer to ""see"". Autonomy does not mean that a weapon might ""wake up in the morning and decide to go and start a war,"" said Stuart Russell, professor of computer science at the University of California at Berkeley. ""It's that they have the capability of locating, selecting and attacking human targets, or targets containing human beings, without human intervention."" The killer robots of any number of sci-fi dystopias are an obvious example, but perhaps not a very practical one. ""People have been exploring that too, (but) to my mind that one is the least useful,"" Russell added. Most weapons are still in the idea or prototype stages, but Russia's war in Ukraine has offered a glimpse of their potential. Remotely piloted drones are not new, but they are becoming increasingly independent and are being used by both sides, sending humans underground to seek refuge. This could be one of the biggest immediate changes, according to Russell. ""A likely consequence of having autonomous weapons is that basically, being visible anywhere on the battlefield will be a death sentence."" Autonomous weapons have several potential advantages for an attacking army: they can be more efficient, can probably be produced more cheaply, and they remove tricky human emotions such as fear or anger from battlefield situations. But these advantages raise ethical questions. For example, if they are so cheap and easy to make, there is virtually no limit to the firepower an aggressor can employ, Russell said. ""I can simply launch a million of them at once if I want to wipe out an entire city or an entire ethnic group,"" he added. Submarines, boats and planes that are capable of operating autonomously could be a huge boost to reconnaissance, surveillance or logistical support in remote or dangerous environments. Such vehicles are at the heart of the ""Replicator"" program launched by the Pentagon to counter China's enormous manpower advantage. The objective is to be able to deploy several thousand cheap and easy-to-replace systems in short order, said US Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, in a variety of areas ranging from maritime to outer-space. The idea is that with so many ""flung into space scores at a time... it becomes impossible to eliminate or degrade them all,"" Hicks said. Many companies are developing and testing autonomous vehicles, like California-based Anduril, which touts an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle ""optimized for a variety of defense and commercial mission types"" including long-range oceanographic sensing, mine countermeasures, and anti-submarine warfare. Powered by AI and capable of synthesizing mountains of data collected by satellites, radars, sensors, and intelligence services, tactical software can offer human planners a real edge. ""Everyone within the (Department of Defence) needs to understand that data is actually the ammunition in an AI war,"" Alexandr Wang, the boss of Scale AI, told a US Congressional hearing this year. ""We have the largest fleet of military hardware in the world. This fleet generates 22 terabytes of data every day. And so if we can properly set up and instrument this data that's being generated into pools of AI-ready datasets, then we can create a pretty insurmountable data advantage when it comes to military use of artificial intelligence."" Scale AI has a contract to deploy a language model on a classified network of a major US Army unit. Its chatbot -- disarmingly named ""Donovan"" -- should allow commanders to plan and act within minutes, rather than weeks, according to the company.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/the-ai-of-war-computers-and-autonomous-killing/articleshow/105259242.cms
2023-11-16,"Woman gets SOS from 'nephew' in Canada, loses Rs 1.4 lakh to AI voice fraud",Amrita Didyala,"HYDERABAD: An Artificial Intelligence (AI) voice fraud cost a woman dear as she ended up transferring Rs 1.4 lakh after the caller spoke exactly like her nephew in Canada , claimed to be in distress and sought immediate cash. According to cyber experts, currently people with family in Canada and Israel are being increasingly targeted with AI voice frauds. By the time 59-year-old Prabhjyot (name changed on request) realised that the AI generated voice had taken her for a ride, she had already made multiple transfers to the account mentioned in the call. ""He sounded just like my nephew and spoke exactly in the Punjabi we speak at home with all the nuances. He called me late in the night and said he had an accident and was about to be jailed. He requested me to transfer money and keep this conversation a secret,"" said Prabhyyot, who is from Delhi, still unable to believe what had happened. In another instance, an elderly woman received a call from her 'nephew' who had recently shifted to Canada seeking help. As she barely did online transactions, she informed her family who nipped the fraud in the bud by a quick video call to the nephew in Canada. Prasad Patibandla, director (operations) at Centre for Research on Cyber Intelligence and Digital Forensics (CRCIDF) in Delhi, said: ""AI voice imitating tools can mimic voice exactly. It's the fraudster speaking at the other end but the AI tool automatically adopts the voice of targeted person which is usually taken from pubic domain such as social media when live casting, voice recording sent to someone or even by the fraudster making a sales call and recording the voice. While creating a sense of urgency is usually part of the drill, having a relative in a troubled country gives an added sense of urgency."" While AI frauds are not reported extensively at cyber crime police stations, experts said people must be extra cautious when they receive calls claiming to be from their relatives in these countries. ""AI voice frauds are happening although in lesser numbers. People must double-check and verify whether the sense of urgency actually exists before transferring any money,"" said KVM Prasad, ACP (cyber crime), Hyderabad.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/woman-gets-sos-from-nephew-in-canada-loses-rs-1-4-lakh-to-ai-voice-fraud/articleshow/105246869.cms
2023-11-11,Odia researcher wins prestigious int'l award,Satyanarayan Pattnaik,"KORAPUT: Abhijeet Parida (28), a native of Chakuleswar village in Cuttack district, led a team of researchers to harness artificial intelligence (AI) to identify brain tumours, a step that could someday help oncologists understand the extent of a patient's disease, quantify the efficacy of treatment and predict outcomes. The innovation helped Abhijeet, a research scholar at the Children's National Hospital in Washington, and his team win the Brain Tumour Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, a competition organised jointly by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), the American Society of Neuroradiology (ASNR) and the Medical Image Computing and Computer-assisted Interventions (MICCAI) society. ""It's a big achievement for us as early tumour detection is a crucial step in the fight against cancer, and this innovative technique promises to accelerate treatment,"" said Abhijeet over phone from the US. In its 13th year, the BraTS challenge aimed at leveraging AI's power to detect tumours through MRI scans of the brain. Abhijeet's team harnessed AI to identify brain tumours At least 968 researchers from across the globe had submitted their findings. Abhijeet and his team secured first place in identifying tumours in paediatric patients, and third position in detecting meningioma in adults. The team consists of nine members - four from Children's National Hospital, three from George Washington University and two from Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Spain. Abhijeet said the contest required participants to use data from multiple institutions and consortia to test competing methods fairly. The team from Children's National Hospital created a method to tap into the power of two types of imaging and machine learning - 3D convolutional neural network and 3D vision transformer-based deep learning models. They identified regions of the brain affected by tumors, made smart data-processing decisions driven by the team's experience in AI for paediatric healthcare and achieved state-of-the-art results, he added. ""The algorithm studies the volume of brain tumors - the most common solid tumors affecting children and adolescents - and a leading cause of disease-related death at a young age,"" he said. Abhijeet and his team got $2,200 cash prize for winning the contest. ""This innovation will assist neuro radiologists and neuro surgery for accurate detection and intervention of cancer in children,"" he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/odia-researcher-wins-prestigious-intl-award/articleshow/105136705.cms
2023-11-09,AI new tool for online scammers as 82% Indians concede to clicking on or fall for fake messages: Survey,Pankaj Doval,"NEW DELHI: AI regulation may still be some time away, but scammers are increasingly riding the technological sophistication of artificial intelligence to target millions of Indians who are spending as many as 105 minutes per week reviewing, verifying or deciding whether a message sent through text, email, social media is real or fake. As many as 82% Indians have clicked on or fallen for fake messages, according to a study by Mcafee. Amongst the sophisticated trickery, the most common forms people fall for include fake job notifications or offers (64%) and bank alert messages (52%), Mcafee said. “AI is a scammer’s favorite tool, helping cybercriminals increase the scale and sophistication of scam messages. The speed of phishing and text message scams is on the rise - a new phishing site is created every 11 seconds. This spotlights the increasing need for solutions that turn the tables on AI scammers; there has never been a more critical time for the country’s 900 million internet users to protect themselves online,” Mcafee said in the report. The study reveals that Indians receive nearly 12 fake messages or scams each day via email, text or social media daily. “An average Indian consumer spends 1.8 hours a week reviewing, verifying or deciding whether a message sent through text, email, social media is real or fake. 82% of Indians have clicked on or fallen for fake messages. 49% of Indians said that scam messages no longer have typos or errors, making them more believable and harder to identify. “It’s truly a sign of the times that most Indian consumers would rather subject themselves to the pain and distress of a root canal than be subjected to scam texts and messages throughout the year,” said Roma Majumder, SVP of Product at McAfee. “And it’s not just the speed and volume, but the sophistication. Thanks to AI, it can be incredibly difficult to know if that delivery text message or bank alert notification is real or not. So much so that 73% of Indians believe they have a better shot at solving the Rubik’s cube than identifying a scam message.” “This onslaught of scam messages is a drain on people’s time, energy, and finances. And it’s why we all need AI to beat AI. Unfortunately, seeing is no longer believing and we need to be equipped with advanced AI technology that can stop and block scam messages in real time,” Majumder added. McAfee’s research revealed four key insights about online scams . It highlights the increased stress people are facing due to the AI driven increase in the number and sophistication of scam messages. Hence, the need for a robust AI-driven defense solution to beat AI scams. Some of the messages used to entice people into scams include, “You’ve won a prize!” (72%), fake job notifications or offers (64%), bank alert message (52%), information about a purchase the recipient didn’t make (37%), Netflix (or similar) subscription updates (35%), fake missed delivery, or delivery problem, notification (29%), and Amazon security alert, or notification messages regarding account updates (27%). Scam-spotting takes up more than two full work weeks each year for users. “About 90% of Indians surveyed indicate that they receive fake messages or scams via email and text on a daily basis, and 84% say the same about social media.” The study surveyed more than 7,000 adults in seven countries, including India, to understand how scam messages, and the increased scam sophistication brought about by artificial intelligence (AI), have impacted the lives of consumers worldwide.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ai-new-tool-for-online-scammers-as-82-indians-concede-to-clicking-on-or-fall-for-fake-messages-survey/articleshow/105072681.cms

2023-11-09,Hollywood vs AI: Actors agree to end strike as union reaches deal for protection from AI,Abhinav Kaustubh,"The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists has ended the longest strike in Hollywood 's history after spending 118 days on picket lines. “We have arrived at a contract that will enable SAG-AFTRA members from every category to build sustainable careers,"" the union said in a note to members. The actors’ union and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers have come to terms, agreeing to a contract valued at over 1 billion dollars. The main issues that were resolved include the use of artificial intelligence in actors' performances and residual payments for actors for shows and movies that stream online. Although no details of the agreement have been disclosed as of yet. One of the sticking points for the actors has also been the use of generative AI . Studios proposed an AI plan that SAG opposed, claiming it allowed studios to scan background performers and use them as digital characters indefinitely without permission from the union or their estate. The actors’ guild rejected the studios' proposal, citing the lack of agreement on several matters, including AI. The guild demanded compensation and consent. In September, the Writers Guild of America ( WGA ) ended its strike after reaching an agreement that included provisions related to AI. This week, the two unions came to terms. The studios agreed to adjust the AI language in their latest proposal, which has been accepted by the SAG-AFTRA. The new contract prohibits studios from using generative AI to write or revise literary material, and anything produced by AI cannot be considered source material. The use of AI software by writers is optional, and the studios must inform the writers if any materials given to them contain AI-generated content. Additionally, the contract explicitly prohibits the exploitation of writers' work to train AI. Due to writer and actor strikes, Hollywood projects were halted for months. Now that the strikes have ended, productions can resume filming.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/hollywood-vs-ai-actors-agree-to-end-strike-as-union-reaches-deal-for-protection-from-ai/articleshow/105099268.cms
2023-11-08,What Barack Obama has to say on the rise of AI and its impact on the world,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has piqued everyone’s interest. Tech companies, governments, users are now key stakeholders in the rise of AI. Recently, the US passed an executive order to regulate the use of AI among other things. In a detailed interview with The Verge, former US president Barack Obama spoke about the rise of AI and its impact. On the positive use of AI, Obama said that “it’s going to impact how we make stuff, how we deliver services, how we get information.” He further said that AI has the potential to “have enormous medical breakthroughs, the potential for us to be able to provide individualised tutoring for kids in remote areas, the potential for us to solve some of our energy challenges and deal with greenhouse gasses.” View on having a regulatory framework for AI The former US president said that it can’t be left to tech companies alone to manage and regulate AI. “We’re going to need to make sure that everybody can have confidence that whatever journey we’re on here with AI, that it’s not just being driven by a few people without any kind of interaction or voice from ordinary folks — the regular people who are going to be using these products and impacted by these products,” he said. He also said that the tech companies he had interacted with gave him a sense that they too want everyone on board. “In my conversations with the tech leaders on this, I think there is, for the first time, some genuine humility because they are seeing the power that these models may have,” he added. Obama believes that that companies know that if AI is as transformative as they expect to be “then having some rules and protections creates a competitive field that allows everybody to participate, come up with new products, compete on price, and compete on functionality, but [prevents us from] taking such big risks that the whole thing blows up in our faces.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/what-barack-obama-has-to-say-on-use-of-ai-and-its-impact-on-the-world/articleshow/105059294.cms
2023-11-08,China's Xi urges countries unite in tackling AI challenges but makes no mention of internet controls,AP,"BEIJING: Chinese President Xi Jinping said Wednesday that potential risks associated with artificial intelligence are challenges that countries should deal with together, remarks that come against the backdrop of China’s rigid control of free speech on the internet. At the same time, China has also maximized the internet’s economic benefits and social media’s propaganda contributions to the ruling Communist Party’s authoritarian agenda. Xi’s prerecorded speech was broadcast at the opening of the World Internet Conference Summit in the eastern city of Wuzhen. He called for common security in cyberspace instead of confrontation. He said China would work with other countries to address risks brought by the development of AI and expressed his objections to “cyberspace hegemony.” China is ready to “promote the safe development of AI,” he said, with the implementation of the Global AI Governance Initiative, a proposal launched by the Chinese government last month calling for an open and fair environment for AI development. Li Shulei, director of the Communist Party’s publicity department, echoed Xi’s remarks at the conference, saying China would work with other countries to “improve the safety, reliability, controllability and fairness of artificial intelligence technology .” The conference was first launched as an annual event in 2014 by the Chinese government to discuss internet development. China blocks most overseas news and social media sites, but lifts them in the Wuzhen area for the duration of the conference. As recently as June, Chinese state-backed hackers foiled Microsoft’s cloud-based security in breaching the email accounts of officials at multiple US agencies that deal with China ahead of Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s trip to Beijing. The surgical, targeted espionage accessed the email of a small number of individuals at an unspecified number of U.S. agencies and was discovered in mid-June by the State Department, US officials said. They said none of the breached systems were classified, nor was any of the stolen data. The hacked officials included Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, whose agency imposed export controls that have stung multiple Chinese companies. In September 2020, the Justice Department has charged five Chinese citizens with hacks targeting more than 100 companies and institutions in the United States and abroad, including social media and video game companies as well as universities and telecommunications providers.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinas-xi-urges-countries-unite-in-tackling-ai-challenges-but-makes-no-mention-of-internet-controls/articleshow/105061322.cms
2023-11-07,Joe Biden’s executive order on artificial intelligence could help experts who aspire to work in the US,Lubna Kably,"MUMBAI: President Biden's executive order (EO) on artificial intelligence (AI), issued on October 30, 2023, could transform the immigration landscape . The EO directs US immigration agencies to streamline the immigration process for individuals who possess AI expertise, amend the J-1 exchange visitor program and modernize the existing immigration pathways for AI experts, including the EB-1, EB-2 (both of which are employment based green cards) and O-1 (non-immigration visas for those with extraordinary abilities) categories and the International Entrepreneur parole program. Timelines relating to smoothing the immigration processes and ushering in suitable policies, have been set for various agencies to ensure that the objective of the EO is met. 1. Visa processing : Within 90 days, the US Department of State (DOS) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are required to streamline processing times for visa petitions and applications, including ensuring continued and timely availability of visa appointments for foreign nationals who seek to work on, study, or conduct research in AI or other critical emerging technologies in the US. They are also required to facilitate continued availability of visa appointments in sufficient volume for applicants with expertise in AI or other critical and emerging technologies. 2. J-1 exchange program: Within the next 180 days, DOS is ordered to consider changes to the J-1 exchange visitor program that could enhance opportunities for AI talent. These include reviewing the J-1 Exchange Visitor Skills list to potentially reduce the number of J-1 nonimmigrants in AI and related fields who are required to return to their home country for two years after completing their J-1 program in the US. The EO urges DOS to consider new regulations governing the two-year home residency requirement for J-1 exchange visitors, including updates to the 2009 list of countries and skills subject to the home-residency requirement. 3. Review and initiate policy changes in existing immigration pathways: DHS is required to within 180 days review and initiate any policy changes that it determines necessary and appropriate to clarify and modernize existing immigration pathways for experts in AI and other critical and emerging technologies, including the EB-1, EB-2 and O-1 categories, and the International Entrepreneur parole program. The EO also asks DOS to consider AI workers who are already in the US in the development of its upcoming domestic visa renewal program and eventually this is to be expanded to F-1 students and J-1 exchange visitors. Mitch Wexler, partner at Fragomen, a global immigration law firm sums up: “While the new EO emphasizes the Biden Administration’s interest in promoting AI innovation through recruitment of foreign talent, immediate changes are unlikely, though some process and policy developments may emerge in the future as a result of the required reviews.” He explains that some changes, like the directive for increased visa appointment availability at US consulates, are likely to depend on agency staffing and resources. Changes that require a regulation would generally be implemented through notice and comment rulemaking, which can take several months or more.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/joe-bidens-executive-order-on-artificial-intelligence-could-help-experts-who-aspire-to-work-in-the-us/articleshow/105042535.cms
2023-11-07,IT sector job switch not paying off? Here's why salary hikes are declining for techies,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Salary increases for tech professionals transitioning to new jobs have seen a sharp decline this fiscal year. Top IT companies are scaling back hiring efforts due to a slowdown in global tech service demand, leading to reduced salary increments, by nearly half, for job switchers. Data from staffing firms, as reported by ET, indicates that software firms are currently offering 18-22% hikes to job changers, a significant drop from the previous year when these candidates could command increases ranging from 40% to as high as 100-120%. Top Picks For You End of work from home? Infosys wants entry & mid-level staff to work from office 10 days a month The most significant dip in compensation is being witnessed among individuals with legacy coding skills . However, those skilled in areas like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud infrastructure continue to enjoy high demand and corresponding pay scales, recruitment experts have said. According to Aditya Mishra, CEO of CIEL HR, a technology hiring firm, roles such as data scientists, full stack developers, and data engineers will continue to experience strong demand. Nevertheless, individuals who used to anticipate job switch hikes of 70-100% are now facing lower increments of 30-40%, and in some cases, as low as 15-20%. This drop in compensation comes amid a significant slowdown in revenue growth in the technology sector, with India's top IT companies, including Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, HCLTech, and Wipro , collectively reducing their workforce by nearly 21,000 employees. Some IT majors, such as Infosys and Wipro, have chosen to skip campus placements in the current season to focus on optimizing their existing workforce. IT sector salary hikes In stark contrast to the previous year, when the tech industry was grappling with soaring demand triggered by the pandemic and engaged in fierce talent acquisition battles, the current landscape has shifted. The sector is experiencing a reduction in demand, leading to a notable decline in the average salary range for engineers with four to seven years of experience. Data from specialist staffing firm Xpheno reveals that the salary range for these engineers has decreased from Rs 15-32 lakh per annum at the end of 2021-22 to Rs 10-26 lakh per annum. Employers have adjusted their negotiation ranges, typically offering 20-30% salary hikes for most positions. Candidates with higher salary expectations are either removed from consideration or moved lower down the shortlist. Recruitment experts suggest that the IT sector has transitioned from a job seekers' market to an employers' market. Additionally, an influx of talent returning from the United States, willing to accept offers at 30-40% lower compensation due to prevailing economic conditions, is further favoring employers, according to Krishna Vij, business head for IT Staffing at TeamLease Digital. Specialized skills in demand Even in a challenging job market, individuals with specialized skills continue to be highly sought after. Specific roles in areas such as cloud computing , full-stack engineering, data analytics, data science, and other critical positions are commanding more competitive compensation offers. Recruiters suggest that salary increments for these in-demand roles within companies may average between 18-22%, a significant increase compared to the general estimate of 6-8% increments for the fiscal year. Investments in digitization have allowed companies to achieve cost savings through process automation, efficient resource allocation, and improved operational workflows. As a result, organizations are directing these investments toward the recruitment of specialized talent in fields like AI and cybersecurity, leading to salary hikes as high as 35-40% for these niche roles, according to TeamLease's Vij. Industry experts observe that cross-hiring between top-tier and mid-sized IT firms will be subdued, as growth has consistently been impacted across the IT industry. While a growth equilibrium has not been reached among top-tier and mid-sized companies, large firms have a relatively strong bench strength. Consequently, they will continue to utilize their existing workforce, focusing on reskilling and optimizing available resources, rather than filling open positions. Mid-sized or smaller IT firms are still engaged in hiring, but both demand and salary hikes have moderated due to market supply constraints, as noted by CIEL's Mishra.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/it-sector-job-switch-not-paying-off-heres-why-salary-hikes-are-declining-for-techies/articleshow/105030320.cms
2023-11-07,Explained: What is GPT-4 Turbo and how is it better,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence startup OpenAI held its first-ever in-person event on November 6. At this event, the company that is behind the popular ChatGPT chatbot announced a more powerful GPT-4 Turbo AI model. The latest mode will allow users to create custom versions of ChatGPT. The company also announced its decision to reduce the prices of the fees that companies and developers pay to run its software. Top Picks For You OpenAI internet-browsing feature on ChatGPT is official ChatGPT vs Claude 2: Google to invest $2 billion in OpenAI competitor Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also made a surprise visit at the event and shared the stage with OpenAI Sam Altman . During his speech, Altman said that the latest announcements came from conversations with developers after knowing about their needs over the past year. Here’s how the latest AI model from the company is more powerful than the previous one. GPT-4 Turbo: Availability OpenAI said GPT-4 Turbo is available in preview for developers now and will be released to all in the coming weeks. OpenAI said it’s also reducing the prices for developers. What is GPT-4 Turbo and how is it better GPT-4 Turbo is the latest AI model and it can now offer answers with context up to April 2023. Previous versions were trained till January 2022. This model also accepts a lot more input. Earlier versions were limited to about 3,000 words. In comparison, the GPT-4 Turbo accepts inputs of up to 300 pages in length. This means users can access the latest model to ask it to summarise entire books. In his speech, Altman said, “We are just as annoyed as all of you, probably more, that GPT ’s knowledge about the world ended in 2021”. GPT-4 even supports DALL-E 3 AI-generated images and text-to-speech. It also has six preset voices to choose from. This will allow users to choose to hear the answer to a query in a variety of different voices. OpenAI has also announced that users will be able to create custom chatbots. Before this, the company allowed enterprise and business users of ChatGPT to upload their data to train and customise the chatbot for particular industries and use cases. Consumers may also see personalised AI chatbots in more places. This includes apps and websites they use regularly. In a release, the company said: “Anyone can easily build their own GPT—no coding is required. You can make them for yourself, just for your company’s internal use, or for everyone. Creating one is as easy as starting a conversation, giving it instructions and extra knowledge, and picking what it can do, like searching the web, making images or analysing data.” The company said: “GPT-4 Turbo input tokens are 3x cheaper than GPT-4 at $0.01 and output tokens are 2x cheaper at $0.03”. This means that developers and enterprise users will be able to save more while running OpenAI’s AI models. Apart from this, OpenAI has also launched its version of the app store.

2023-11-06,"Now, AI to calculate stamp duty for sale deeds in Goa",Murari Shetye,"PANAJI: The state government has decided to upload the market price of land parcels on its sub-registrar portal. Once up, artificial intelligence will automatically generate the amount that needs to be paid as stamp duty by anyone who wishes to execute a deed of sale, law minister Nilesh Cabral told TOI. Cabral said that at present, the public faces some difficulties to execute deeds of sale. He added that the government will upload the market price for each survey number. At present, two departments are involved in the collection of stamp duty - revenue and law. The land price, however, is determined by the revenue department . Cabral said that in some cases, deeds of sale have to be referred to the collector for determination of land price. ""Revenue minister Atanasio 'Babush' Monserrate and I are working to upload the government-specified land price,"" he told TOI. ""Our (law) department's role is to develop artificial intelligence (AI), and the rate would automatically be changed every year based on the recommendations of the revenue department."" Cabral also said that this would reduce human intervention in executing deeds of sale. After Punjab, Manipur, and Andaman & Nicobar, Goa is the fourth state or Union territory to adopt the national generic document registration system (NGDRS). The NGDRS has been developed by NIC under the Union ministry of electronics and information technology, and is being implemented at a cost of Rs 40 crore across the country. The system aims to improve ease of doing business in Goa. As citizens upload documents, they get serial numbers, so they can be served on a first-come first-serve basis. NGDRS was first started in Quepem taluka and then was introduced in all 12 taluka sub-registrar offices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/now-ai-to-calculate-stamp-duty-for-sale-deeds-in-goa/articleshow/105001552.cms
2023-11-05,"Humanoid robots are here, but they're a little awkward. Do we really need them?",AP,"Building a robot that's both human-like and useful is a decades-old engineering dream inspired by popular science fiction . While the latest artificial intelligence craze has sparked another wave of investments in the quest to build a humanoid, most of the current prototypes are clumsy and impractical, looking better in staged performances than in real life. That hasn't stopped a handful of startups from keeping at it. ""The intention is not to start from the beginning and say, 'Hey, we're trying to make a robot look like a person,'"" said Jonathan Hurst, co-founder and chief robot officer at Agility Robotics. ""We're trying to make robots that can operate in human spaces."" Do we even need humanoids ? Hurst makes a point of describing Agility's warehouse robot Digit as human-centric, not humanoid, a distinction meant to emphasize what it does over what it's trying to be. What it does, for now, is pick up tote bins and move them. Amazon announced in October it will begin testing Digits for use in its warehouses, and Agility opened an Oregon factory in September to mass produce them. Digit has a head containing cameras, other sensors and animated eyes, and a torso that essentially works as its engine. It has two arms and two legs, but its legs are more bird-like than human, with an inverted knees appearance that resembles so-called digitigrade animals such as birds, cats and dogs that walk on their toes rather than on flat feet. Rival robot-makers, like Figure AI, are taking a more purist approach on the idea that only true humanoids can effectively navigate workplaces, homes and a society built for humans. Figure also plans to start with a relatively simple use case, such as in a retail warehouse, but aims for a commercial robot that can be ""iterated on like an iPhone"" to perform multiple tasks to take up the work of humans as birth rates decline around the world. ""There's not enough people doing these jobs, so the market's massive,"" said Figure AI CEO Brett Adcock. ""If we can just get humanoids to do work that humans are not wanting to do because there's a shortfall of humans, we can sell millions of humanoids, billions maybe."" At the moment, however, Adcock's firm doesn't have a prototype that's ready for market. Founded just over a year ago and after having raised tens of millions of dollars, it recently revealed a 38-second video of Figure walking through its test facility in Sunnyvale, California. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is also trying to build a humanoid, called Optimus, through the electric car-maker's robotics division, but a hyped-up live demonstration last year of the robot's awkwardly halting steps didn't impress experts in the robotics field. Seemingly farther along is Tesla's Austin, Texas-based neighbor Apptronik, which unveiled its Apollo humanoid in an August video demonstration. All the attention - and money - poured into making ungainly humanoid machines might make the whole enterprise seem like a futile hobby for wealthy technologists, but for some pioneers of legged robots it's all about what you learn along the way. ""Not only about their design and operation, but also about how people respond to them, and about the critical underlying technologies for mobility, dexterity, perception and intelligence,"" said Marc Raibert, the co-founder of Boston Dynamics, best known for its dog-like robots named Spot. Raibert said sometimes the path of development is not along a straight line. Boston Dynamics, now a subsidiary of carmaker Hyundai, experimented with building a humanoid that could handle boxes. ""That led to development of a new robot that was not really a humanoid, but had several characteristics of a humanoid,"" he said via an emailed message. ""But the changes resulted in a new robot that could handle boxes faster, could work longer hours, and could operate in tight spaces, such as a truck. So humanoid research led to a useful non-humanoid robot."" Some startups aiming for human-like machines focused on improving the dexterity of robotic fingers before trying to get their robots to walk. Walking is ""not the hardest problem to solve in humanoid robotics,"" said Geordie Rose, co-founder and CEO of British Columbia, Canada-based startup Sanctuary AI. ""The hardest problem is the problem of understanding the world and being able to manipulate it with your hands."" Sanctuary's newest and first bipedal robot, Phoenix, can stock shelves, unload delivery vehicles and operate a checkout, early steps toward what Rose sees as a much longer-term goal of getting robots to perceive the physical world to be able to reason about it in a way that resembles intelligence. Like other humanoids, it's meant to look endearing, because how it interacts with real people is a big part of its function. ""We want to be able to provide labor to the world, not just for one thing, but for everybody who needs it,"" Rose said. ""The systems have to be able to think like people. So we could call that artificial general intelligence if you'd like. But what I mean more specifically is the systems have to be able to understand speech and they need to be able to convert the understanding of speech into action, which will satisfy job roles across the entire economy."" Agility's Digit robot caught Amazon's attention because it can walk and also move around in a way that could complement the e-commerce giant's existing fleet of vehicle-like robots that move large carts around its vast warehouses. ""The mobility aspect is more interesting than the actual form,"" said Tye Brady, Amazon's chief technologist for robotics, after the company showed it off at a media event in Seattle. Right now, Digit is being tested to help with the repetitive task of picking up and moving empty totes. But just having it there is bound to resurrect some fears about robots taking people's jobs, a narrative Amazon is trying to prevent from taking hold. Agility Robotics co-founder and CEO Damion Shelton said the warehouse robot is ""just the first use case"" of a new generation of robots he hopes will be embraced rather than feared as they prepare to enter businesses and homes. ""So in 10, 20 years, you're going to see these robots everywhere,"" Shelton said. ""Forever more, human- centric robots like that are going to be part of human life. So that's pretty exciting.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/humanoid-robots-are-here-but-theyre-a-little-awkward-do-we-really-need-them/articleshow/104991555.cms
2023-11-05,"AI can make substantial contributions to climate-resilient, low-emissions development",ANI,"GERMANY: Artificial intelligence (AI) can make substantial contributions to climate-resilient and low-emissions development. UN Climate Change's Initiative on Artificial Intelligence for Climate Action explores the role of AI as a powerful tool for advancing and scaling up transformative climate action in developing countries. In line with the call by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to develop AI that is ""reliable and safe"" and that can ""supercharge climate action"" to propel us towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, the #AI4ClimateAction Initiative aims to deliver concrete and transformative results, both on policy and implementation, under the first joint work programme of UN Climate Change's Technology Mechanism. Some AI-powered solutions for climate action in developing countries, including least-developed countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS), are already underway. Innovative adaptation technologies, such as AI-powered models, can provide early warning systems to alert communities about impending disasters. The Biosphere Reserves as Observatories for Climate Change Adaptation in Southern Africa (Be-Resilient), for example, uses AI to predict flooding patterns in Mozambique. Agri-food systems and crop management can be optimized with AI predicting the best planting times, assessing soil health and monitoring pest and disease outbreaks. AI-driven precision agriculture can also reduce water usage, promote sustainable farming practices and boost food production. The Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), for instance, is using AI to enhance impact-based forecasting by the Climate Prediction and Applications Centre in East Africa's agriculture sectors, which is key for food security, livelihoods and economic development. Renewable energy systems' efficiency and reliability can be improved by AI algorithms that predict energy demand, optimize grid operations and integrate renewable energy sources seamlessly, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting a shift toward low-emission energy solutions. One example is the Global Renewables Watch, a live atlas intended to map and measure utility-scale solar and wind installations using AI and satellite imagery, allowing users to evaluate clean energy transition progress and track trends over time. The UN Climate Change Technology Executive Committee (TEC) will convene a high-level event on AI for climate action at COP28, in collaboration with the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN) and the incoming COP Presidency. It is also preparing to launch - together with Enterprise Neurosystem - the AI Innovation Grand Challenge: a climate technology and innovation competition to drive new AI applications for climate mitigation and adaptation action in developing countries.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/ai-can-make-substantial-contributions-to-climate-resilient-low-emissions-development/articleshow/104985146.cms
2023-11-05,"Striking actors reviewing 'last, best and final offer' from Hollywood studios",Reuters,"Negotiators representing Hollywood actors are considering a new proposal that major studios described as their ""last, best and final offer"" to end a four-month-long strike, the SAG-AFTRA union said on Saturday. SAG-AFTRA members walked off the job in July to demand higher compensation in the streaming TV era plus protections around the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and other gains. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents Walt Disney, Netflix and other companies, presented its latest offer on Saturday, SAG-AFTRA leadership said in an update to members. ""We are reviewing it and considering our response within the context of the critical issues addressed in our proposals,"" the union said. A representative for the AMPTP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier this week, union leaders expressed ""cautious optimism"" that a deal could be reached soon but also said there were gaps between the two sides on various issues including the use of AI. Actors are seeking assurances that their digital likenesses will not be used without their permission. The work stoppage, along with a Writers Guild of America strike that ended in September, has cost the California economy at least $6 billion, according to a Milken Institute estimate.

2023-11-05,"As a teen, she loved video games. Now she's using AI to try to quash malaria",NYT News Service,"When she was in her early teens, Rokhaya Diagne would retreat to her brother's room, where she played online computer games for hours, day after day, until her mother finally got fed up. ""My mom said, 'This is an addiction,'"" Diagne said. ""She said if I didn't stop, she would send me to the hospital to see a psychiatrist."" Her mother's interventions worked. While Diagne's passion for computers has, if anything, intensified, she has redirected her energies to higher pursuits than leveling up at Call of Duty. Now her goals include using artificial intelligence to help the world eradicate malaria by 2030, a project she is focused on at her health startup. Video games ""taught me a lot of things,"" said Diagne, 25, a Senegalese computer science major who lives in Dakar, the capital. ""They gave me problem-solving skills. ""I don't regret playing those things,"" she added. A fast talker in bluejeans and hijab, Diagne is part of a subset of Africa's enormous youth population whose lives have been shaped by screens and the internet - and who are connected to the world to a degree that no generation before them could have imagined. For young Africans interested in technology-related careers, the internet has offered a powerful addition to an education system that some experts worry is hobbling Africa's ability to take advantage of its young people. The wealth of free online coding boot camps, robotics lessons and lectures from the likes of Stanford, Oxford and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are having a big impact across Africa, inspiring careers in engineering and seeding ideas for startups. While some of her cohorts are most passionate about sensor fusion or robotics, Diagne is into AI and machine deep-learning. She helped create an award-winning networking app to meet others with similar interests - like Tinder but for tech nerds. And she founded a startup called Afyasense (she borrowed ""afya,"" or health, from Swahili, an East African language) for her disease-detection projects using AI. Like many other young people in Africa's tech boom, Diagne is at the center of overlapping phenomena on the continent - a growing, educated middle class raising even more educated children who, with each tap on a keyboard, have adopted a sense that the continent's biggest problems can be solved. Diagne wants to use AI to improve health outcomes in the region, a choice she made after a range of childhood illnesses landed her in Dakar hospitals, which struggled to provide consistent, quality care. Diagne's drive has earned her recognition. Her malaria project recently won an award at an AI conference in Ghana and a national award in Senegal for social entrepreneurship, as well as $8,000 in funding. As a child, she has had a huge appetite for research, fed by her father, a retired literature professor and writer. She enrolled at the Ecole Superieure Polytechnique de Dakar as a biology major and scored an internship at the Principal Hospital of Dakar. But days of reviewing lab samples helped her realize that kind of work wasn't for her. ""I wanted way more challenges than fearing the bacteria in my body,"" she said. ""What I wanted was innovation and being able to create and use my brain for something instead of predictive results that I just followed."" Dejected that she had made the wrong choice, Diagne dropped out of school and spent a year plotting her next steps. She recalled something her brother used to tell her: Do things that are harder because there's less competition.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/as-a-teen-she-loved-video-games-now-shes-using-ai-to-try-to-quash-malaria/articleshow/104975160.cms

2023-11-04,"AI tech regulation in 5-6 months, says minister of state for IT and electronics Rajeev Chandrasekhar",Pankaj Doval,"NEW DELHI: Artificial intelligence (AI) should ""not be demonised"", and India will work towards creating an early regulatory framework around it, possibly over next five-six months, minister of state for IT and Electronics Rajeev Chandrasekhar said here on Friday. The country will take steps to create a global consensus on managing the challenges emanating from the rapidly evolving technological innovation, including impact on jobs, privacy of individuals, weaponisation and criminalisation of the smart algos, he said. The minister also said India is open to having discussions with China as part of multi-country deliberations, but added that the neighbouring country has to be ""genuine"" in its approach and intentions around regulating AI for good. ""We all know that over the last 10 years or so, we have allowed regulation to fall behind innovation, may be by mistake, or tacitly, or inadvertently. Today, all the countries are paying a price for this collectively as we witness and tackle the menace of toxicity and misinformation across social media platforms. AI has the potential to amplify toxicity and weaponisation to the next level. While countries had previously made a mistake to have regulation fall behind innovation, we can now be ahead, or at least be at par, when it comes to regulating AI,"" Chandrasekhar said. The minister, however, made it clear that India does not want to ""demonise"" AI. ""In my closing remarks at the 'AI Safety Summit 2023' in the UK, I have spoken about the need to have safe and trusted AI platforms, distinguishable from unsafe and untrusted platforms. We have proposed that AI should not be demonised to a point that it is regulated out of existence. AI presents a big opportunity in India."" The minister said that there is a need to address the risks that may arise out of AI, while talking about safety and trust. ""The broad areas which we need to deliberate upon is workforce disruption by AI, its impact on privacy of individuals, weaponisation and criminalisation of AI, and what do we do to have a global, coordinated action against banned actors, who may create unsafe and untrusted models that may be available on the dark web and can be misused."" On Elon Musk's statement that AI can be disruptive for jobs, he said that the views are ""not unusual"" as every innovation had led to ""transformation"" of the workforce. ""So, it will be no different. The only difference is that the advent of AI will be a lot more rapid than what we saw in previous innovations. This will be a lot more urgent and faster than anything in the history of technology. Thus, countries and companies will need to sharply align their strategies of skilling and other factors."" Chandrasekhar said that the government will be carrying forward the theme at the Global Partner for AI (GPAI) Summit, that will be held here in December, where India is the chair. ""We need to keep pace with technology. This is not a conversation that should remain at this level. We need to have a framework in the next three to six months. This urgency should be clearly understood. The innovation is moving at hyper speed and AI is now upon us.

2023-11-03,Poll shows most US adults think AI will add to election misinformation in 2024,AP,"NEW YORK: The warnings have grown louder and more urgent as 2024 approaches: The rapid advance of artificial intelligence tools threatens to amplify misinformation in next year's presidential election at a scale never seen before. Most adults in the US feel the same way, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. The poll found that nearly 6 in 10 adults (58%) think AI tools — which can micro-target political audiences, mass produce persuasive messages, and generate realistic fake images and videos in seconds — will increase the spread of false and misleading information during next year's elections. By comparison, 6% think AI will decrease the spread of misinformation while one-third say it won’t make much of a difference. “Look what happened in 2020 — and that was just social media,” said 66-year-old Rosa Rangel of Fort Worth, Texas. Rangel, a Democrat who said she had seen a lot of “lies” on social media in 2020, said she thinks AI will make things even worse in 2024 — like a pot “brewing over.” Just 30% of American adults have used AI chatbots or image generators and fewer than half (46%) have heard or read at least some about AI tools. Still, there's a broad consensus that candidates shouldn't be using AI. When asked whether it would be a good or bad thing for 2024 presidential candidates to use AI in certain ways, clear majorities said it would be bad for them to create false or misleading media for political ads (83%), to edit or touch-up photos or videos for political ads (66%), to tailor political ads to individual voters (62%) and to answer voters’ questions via chatbot (56%). The sentiments are supported by majorities of Republicans and Democrats, who agree it would be a bad thing for the presidential candidates to create false images or videos (85% of Republicans and 90% of Democrats) or to answer voter questions (56% of Republicans and 63% of Democrats). The bipartisan pessimism toward candidates using AI comes after it already has been deployed in the Republican presidential primary. In April, the Republican National Committee released an entirely AI-generated ad meant to show the future of the country if President Joe Biden is reelected. It used fake but realistic-looking photos showing boarded-up storefronts, armored military patrols in the streets and waves of immigrants creating panic. The ad disclosed in small lettering that it was generated by AI. Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor of Florida, also used AI in his campaign for the GOP nomination. He promoted an ad that used AI-generated images to make it look as if former President Donald Trump was hugging Dr. Anthony Fauci, an infectious disease specialist who oversaw the nation's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Never Back Down, a super PAC supporting DeSantis, used an AI voice-cloning tool to imitate Trump’s voice, making it seem like he narrated a social media post. “I think they should be campaigning on their merits, not their ability to strike fear into the hearts of voters,” said Andie Near, a 42-year-old from Holland, Michigan, who typically votes for Democrats. She has used AI tools to retouch images in her work at a museum, but she said she thinks politicians using the technology to mislead can “deepen and worsen the effect that even conventional attack ads can cause.” College student Thomas Besgen, a Republican, also disagrees with campaigns using deepfake sounds or imagery to make it seem as if a candidate said something they never said. “Morally, that’s wrong,” the 21-year-old from Connecticut said. Besgen, a mechanical engineering major at the University of Dayton in Ohio, said he is in favor of banning deepfake ads or, if that’s not possible, requiring them to be labeled as AI-generated. The Federal Election Commission is currently considering a petition urging it to regulate AI-generated deepfakes in political ads ahead of the 2024 election. While skeptical of AI's use in politics, Besgen said he is enthusiastic about its potential for the economy and society. He is an active user of AI tools such as ChatGPT to help explain history topics he’s interested in or to brainstorm ideas. He also uses image-generators for fun — for example, to imagine what sports stadiums might look like in 100 years. He said he typically trusts the information he gets from ChatGPT and will likely use it to learn more about the presidential candidates, something that just 5% of adults say they are likely to do. The poll found that Americans are more likely to consult the news media (46%), friends and family (29%), and social media (25%) for information about the presidential election than AI chatbots. “Whatever response it gives me, I would take it with a grain of salt,” Besgen said. The vast majority of Americans are similarly skeptical toward the information AI chatbots spit out. Just 5% say they are extremely or very confident that the information is factual, while 33% are somewhat confident, according to the survey. Most adults (61%) say they are not very or not at all confident that the information is reliable. That’s in line with many AI experts’ warnings against using chatbots to retrieve information. The artificial intelligence large language models powering chatbots work by repeatedly selecting the most plausible next word in a sentence, which makes them good at mimicking styles of writing but also prone to making things up. Adults associated with both major political parties are generally open to regulations on AI. They responded more positively than negatively toward various ways to ban or label AI-generated content that could be imposed by tech companies, the federal government, social media companies or the news media. About two-thirds favor the government banning AI-generated content that contains false or misleading images from political ads, while a similar number want technology companies to label all AI-generated content made on their platforms. Biden set in motion some federal guidelines for AI on Monday when he signed an executive order to guide the development of the rapidly progressing technology. The order requires the industry to develop safety and security standards and directs the Commerce Department to issue guidance to label and watermark AI-generated content. Americans largely see preventing AI-generated false or misleading information during the 2024 presidential elections as a shared responsibility. About 6 in 10 (63%) say a lot of the responsibility falls on the technology companies that create AI tools, but about half give a lot of that duty to the news media (53%), social media companies (52%), and the federal government (49%). Democrats are somewhat more likely than Republicans to say social media companies have a lot of responsibility, but generally agree on the level of responsibility for technology companies, the news media and the federal government.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/poll-shows-most-us-adults-think-ai-will-add-to-election-misinformation-in-2024/articleshow/104931755.cms
2023-11-03,Elon Musk-owned X is rolling out this AI-powered feature on feed,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Elon Musk has announced that X, previously Twitter, now has another feature that is powered by artificial intelligence (AI). It is a part of the whole lineup of features that have been and will be introduced over time to make X an everything app. “AI-based ‘See similar’ posts feature is rolling out now on X,” Musk said in a post. X: The everything app Musk first talked about the feature during an internal X meeting on October 26. He was talking about various features that the company is working on. “There are a ton more. We’re also working to improve search dramatically. We want to have a semantic search. So if you type in search terms, it knows what you mean and then can bring up the text, pictures, and video that are what you mean,” he said. “Not just strictly a text comparison. We’re seeing the beginnings of that with the ‘see similar posts’ capability. That is sort of an AI-based system,” he mentioned. Musk said that the company needs to move the entire system to be AI-based, including the ‘recommended for you’ posts being AI-based. “Essentially, you populate a vector space around the user and then any given post would also have a vector space. You correlate the two vector spaces, and you show people what is most likely interesting to them. And that will update all of the heuristics that we currently have,” he said.

2023-11-03,Rishi Sunak says agreements at UK summit tip the balance in favor of humanity in fight against AI threats,AP,"BLETCHLEY PARK, ENGLAND: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Thursday that achievements at the first international AI Safety Summit would “tip the balance in favor of humanity” in the race to contain the risks from rapid advances in cutting-edge artificial intelligence . Speaking after two days of talks at Bletchley Park, a former codebreaking spy base near London, Sunak said agreements struck at the meeting of politicians, researchers and business leaders “show that we have both the political will and the capability to control this technology, and secure its benefits for the long term.” Sunak organized the summit as a forum for officials, experts and the tech industry to better understand cutting-edge, “frontier” AI that some scientists warn could pose a risk to humanity’s very existence. He hailed the gathering's achievements, including a “Bletchley Declaration” committing nations to tackle the biggest threats from artificial intelligence, a deal to vet tech firms' AI models before their release, and an agreement to call together a global expert panel on AI, inspired by the United Nations' climate change panel. Some argue that governments must go further and faster on oversight. Britain has no plans for specific legislation to regulate AI, unlike the US and the European Union. Vice President Kamala Harris attended the summit, stressing steps the Biden administration has taken to hold tech firms to account. She said Thursday that the United States' “bold action” should be “inspiring and instructive to other nations.” United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged a coordinated global effort, comparing risks from AI to the Nazi threat that Britain’s wartime codebreakers worked to combat. “Bletchley Park played a vital part in the computing breakthroughs that helped to defeat Nazism,” he said “The threat posed by AI is more insidious – but could be just as dangerous.” The UN chief, like many others, warned about the need to act swiftly to keep pace with AI’s breathtaking advances. General purpose AI chatbots like ChatGPT released over the past year stirred both amazement and fear with their ability to generate text, audio and images that closely resembled human work. “The speed and reach of today’s AI technology are unprecedented,” Guterres said. “The paradox is that in the future, it will never move as slowly as today. The gap between AI and its governance is wide and growing.” Sunak hailed the summit as a success, despite its arguably modest achievements. He managed to get 28 nations — including the US and China — to sign up to working toward “shared agreement and responsibility” about AI risks, and to hold further meetings in South Korea and France over the next year. China did not attend the second day, which focused on meetings among what the UK termed a small group of countries “with shared values.” Sunak held a roundtable with politicians from the EU, the UN, Italy, Germany, France and Australia. Announcing the expert panel on Thursday, Sunak said pioneering computer scientist Yoshua Bengio, dubbed one of the “godfathers” of AI, had agreed to chair production of its first report on the state of AI science. Sunak said likeminded governments and AI companies also had reached a “landmark agreement” to work together on testing the safety of AI models before they’re released to the public. Leading AI companies at the meeting including OpenAI, Google’s DeepMind, Anthropic and Inflection AI have agreed to “deepen access” to their frontier AI models, he said. Binding regulation for AI was not among the summit's goals. Sunak said the UK's approach should not be to rush into regulation but to fully understand AI first. Harris emphasized the US administration's more hands-on approach in a speech at the US embassy on Wednesday, saying the world needs to act right away to address “the full spectrum” of AI risks, not just existential threats such as massive cyberattacks or AI-formulated bioweapons. She announced a new US AI safety institute to draw up standards for testing AI models for public use. She said it would collaborate with a similar UK institute announced by Sunak days earlier. One of the Biden administration’s main concerns is that advances in AI are widening inequality within societies and between countries. As a step towards addressing that, Britain's foreign secretary James Cleverly announced a $100 million fund, supported by the UK, the US and others, to help ensure African countries get a share of AI’s benefits – and that 46 African languages are fed into its models. Cleverly told reporters that it’s crucial there is a “diversity of voice” informing AI. “If it was just Euro-Atlantic and China, we would miss stuff, potentially huge amounts of stuff,” he said. Sunak capped the summit with a cozy onstage chat with Tesla CEO Elon Musk at a business reception in London’s grand Lancaster House. Musk is among tech executives who have warned that AI could pose a risk to humanity’s future. “Here we are for the first time, really in human history, with something that is going to be far more intelligent than us,” Musk said at the summit. “It’s not clear to me if we can control such a thing.” The conversation with Sunak — streamed after it happened on the Musk-owned social network X — ranged over topics from whether AI would remove the need for work to the need to have an off-switch for humanoid robots that could turn on their makers. Musk likened AI to “a magic genie” that could grant all wishes, but noted that those fairytales rarely end well. “One of the future challenges is how do you find meaning in life?” he said. The pair did not take questions from journalists. Sunak said earlier that it was important not to be “alarmist” about the technology, which could bring huge benefits. “But there is a case to believe that it may pose a risk on a scale like pandemics and nuclear war, and that’s why, as leaders, we have a responsibility to act to take the steps to protect people, and that’s exactly what we’re doing,"" he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/rishi-sunak-says-agreements-at-uk-summit-tip-the-balance-in-favor-of-humanity-in-fight-against-ai-threats/articleshow/104941693.cms
2023-11-03,"India, 27 other nations and EU sign first international declaration to address AI risks",ANI,"NEW YORK: India, along with 27 other countries and the European Union signed a declaration at a meeting in the United Kingdom pledging to work together to assess the risks associated with artificial intelligence .

Taking to social media platform X, the official page for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's office said, ""Leading AI nations have reached a world-first agreement on AI Safety."" ""The Bletchley Park Declaration sees 28 countries agree on opportunities, risks and the need for international action on frontier AI, systems that pose the most urgent and dangerous risks,"" it added. The UK government on Wednesday issued a statement titled ""The Bletchley Declaration"", which was signed by delegates from the 28 participating nations--including the EU-- and issued a dire warning about the threats presented by the most sophisticated ""frontier"" artificial intelligence systems. ""Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents enormous global opportunities: it has the potential to transform and enhance human wellbeing, peace and prosperity. To realise this, we affirm that, for the good of all, AI should be designed, developed, deployed, and used, in a manner that is safe, in such a way as to be human-centric, trustworthy and responsible,"" the declaration read. The Bletchley Park declaration also noted the importance of AI systems in various domains of daily routine like housing, employment, transport, education, health, accessibility, justice, and added that their use is likely to see an ascent. ""We recognise that this is therefore a unique moment to act and affirm the need for the safe development of AI and for the transformative opportunities of AI to be used for good and for all, in an inclusive manner in our countries and globally,"" it read. ""Alongside these opportunities, AI also poses significant risks, including in those domains of daily life. To that end, we welcome relevant international efforts to examine and address the potential impact of AI systems in existing fora and other relevant initiatives, and the recognition that the protection of human rights, transparency and explainability, fairness, accountability, regulation, safety, appropriate human oversight, ethics, bias mitigation, privacy and data protection needs to be addressed,"" it added. The AI risk will be addressed on both national and international levels and will lay emphasis on identifying AI safety risks of shared concern and building a shared scientific and evidence-based understanding of these risks. ""In furtherance of this agenda, we resolve to support an internationally inclusive network of scientific research on frontier AI safety that encompasses and complements existing and new multilateral, plurilateral and bilateral collaboration, including through existing international fora and other relevant initiatives, to facilitate the provision of the best science available for policy making and the public good,"" the declaration stated further. Union Minister of State for Electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar, in his address at the world's first global summit on Artificial Intelligence in the UK on Wednesday, said India looks at AI with a prism of openness, safety, trust and accountability. Addressing the 'AI Safety Summit 2023', Chandrasehar said India has maintained that international collaborations and international conversations was extremely important at a time and a year when ""technology is throwing up most exiting opportunities ever in the history of mankind."" The minister emphasised that India sees AI as ""the next big opportunity."" ""We are extremely clear in our minds on mitigation on what AI and indeed any emerging technology can and will represent, a prism of openness, safety, trust and accountability,"" he said. The Union Minister noted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had for years argued that the future of tech be it innovations or partnerships or the institutional framework for regulating the tech and innovations for the common good for all mankind should be driven by a coalition of nations rather than one country or two countries an institutional framework is a lot more sustainable. ""The Indian digital economy and the innovation economy and ecosystem today is growing by two and a half to three times faster than the non-digital part of the GDP. AI is a kinetic enabler of the already accelerating digital economy, innovation, growth, and governments,"" the minister said. Meanwhile, tech billionaire and CEO of X Elon Musk was among those who were seen at the two-day summit led by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak that began yesterday at the historic Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire. According to the UK government, the summit's objectives are for participants to ""work towards a shared understanding of risks"" posed by AI and organise a global effort to mitigate them.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/india-27-other-nations-and-eu-sign-first-international-declaration-to-address-ai-risks/articleshow/104904367.cms

The UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak envisions Britain to be a global leader in AI safety . After the event, Musk will do a live interview with Sunak. “In conversation with Elon Musk. After the AI Safety Summit Thursday night on X,” Sunak posted. What the summit is all about The two-day AI Summit will start on November 1 and is aimed at examining the risks of the fast-growing technology. This has been in conversation since early this year when several companies started to launch their AI-powered products. At that time, several testers suggested that the AI models were not ready to be used in day-to-day life because they were biassed. This prompted several countries and regions, including the US and the European Union to build a framework to regulate the technology. The summit will take place at Bletchley Park in southern England, a place that has an historical significance. This is where Britain's World War Two code-breakers worked. List of attendees The event is expected to be attended by around 100 guests. Apart from Musk and Altman, US Vice President Kamala Harris, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, China’s tech vice minister Wu Zhaohui and United Nations' Secretary-General Antonio Guterres are also expected to attend.

2023-11-01,AI named word of the year,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"AI, the abbreviation for artificial intelligence , has been chosen as the Word of the Year 2023 by Collins Dictionary . The dictionary defines AI as the ""modelling of human mental functions by computer programs."" Alex Beecroft , the director of Collins Dictionary, told BBC that AI has been the most talked-about topic of 2023. ""We know that AI has been a big focus this year in the way that it has developed and has quickly become as ubiquitous and embedded in our lives as email, streaming or any other once futuristic, now everyday technology,"" he added. According to Collins, their team of language experts analysed the Collins Corpus, which is a vast database consisting of over 20 billion words. The database incorporates written material from various sources, including websites, newspapers, magazines, and books published worldwide. The team also gathered spoken material from radio, television, and everyday conversations. To ensure the Collins dictionary remains up-to-date, new data is added to the Corpus every month. This helps the dictionary's editors to identify new words and their meanings from the moment they are first used. ""AI's selection as the word of the year by Collins Dictionary reflects the profound impact of artificial intelligence on our rapidly evolving world, where innovation and transformation are driven by the power of algorithms and data,"" said OpenAI, the company behind the AI chatbot ChatGPT . Since OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public in November 2022, artificial intelligence has been a hot topic. Following this, every major tech company has been racing to capitalise on the trend. Now, there are several other AI chatbots, including Google’s Bard, and the company is pouring billions into advancing its artificial intelligence. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has also been riding the AI bandwagon, releasing its own language models and integrating them into its apps and services. Not just them, but whatever new service or product comes out has somehow AI in it.

2023-10-31,US issues order regulating development of AI,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"NEW DELHI: After being warned that Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be harmful to humanity, US President Joe Biden issued an order on Monday regulating the development of AI . In a statement, the White House deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed said, “President Biden is rolling out the strongest set of actions any government in the world has ever taken on AI safety, security, and trust.” He further stated that this is the next step in an ""aggressive strategy"" to do everything on all fronts to harness the benefits of AI and mitigate the risks. It is pertinent to note that Google, Amazon, and Microsoft-backed AI will now be required to share safety test results with the government whenever they train an AI model that poses a potential “serious risk to national security, national economic security, or national public health and safety.” Stronger standards for AI Under this new strategy, new stronger standards will be developed for the AI. After the AI experts expressed feats that the technology could be used to help engineer bioweapons, Biden planned to roll out stronger standards. Biden is tasking the National Institute of Standards and Technology to craft metrics for so-called “red-testing” to ensure safety in the programs. He is also asking the commerce department to set up guidelines for watermarking AI-generated content. Additionally, the president is tapping the National Security Council to iron out ethical AI principles for the use of the technology in intelligence-gathering operations. To protect privacy As AI is dangerous and after seeing various crimes using this intelligence, Biden is calling for the federal government to help finance research into technologies like cryptographic tools that can protect against eavesdropping. The administration is also planning to study how companies extract commercially available information and encourage the use of AI training modules that are designed to protect privacy. The Department of Justice and federal civil rights offices will also be required to compile best practices on how to prevent the technology from being used to amplify discrimination. Approaches international agencies Looming over the new concerns that bolstered AI regulations could stifle US development of the critical technology and cede ground to geopolitical rivals such as China. To address this, Biden is making the State and Commerce departments push for international frameworks on the new technology. The administration will also work to streamline visas to entice highly skilled workers and developers into the US. Additionally, the administration will build up the National AI Research Resource, which will help give AI developers access to an array of resources to further their research projects in a bid to buoy innovation. The announcement of Biden’s executive order is the first in a series of AI-related events and initiatives planned for this week.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-issues-order-regulating-development-of-ai/articleshow/104835327.cms
2023-10-30,US President Joe Biden signs executive order to regulate artificial intelligence,Abhinav Kaustubh,"US President Joe Biden signed an order to regulate generative AI and protect the public. The Biden administration seeks to increase safety around artificial intelligence (AI) and protect consumers and workers from AI-related risks. The order sets eight objectives for AI development – safety, security, privacy, fairness, consumer protection, worker support, innovation, and responsible government use. These initiatives will be implemented in stages over the next year. Minor safety improvements will be put in place in the next 90 days, while comprehensive reporting mandates may take up to a year. An ""AI council"" led by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Bruce Reed will oversee these initiatives. US government agencies are tasked to create standards to protect against AI misuse in biological engineering, establish content authentication best practices, and build advanced cybersecurity. The National Institute of Standards and Safety (NIST) will create standards to test AI models before public release, while the Department of Energy and Department of Homeland Security will address potential infrastructure threats and cybersecurity risks. Developers of large AI models must share safety test results. Defense Production Act to ensure risky AI models don’t get in the hands of the public The Biden administration has set new standards for AI safety and security, including reporting requirements for developers whose models might impact national or economic security. The Defense Production Act will ensure companies developing risky models must notify the federal government and share safety test results before releasing them to the public. The EO will establish a cybersecurity program based on the AI Cyber Challenge to develop AI tools that can autonomously root out security vulnerabilities in software infrastructure. Federal agencies to develop watermarking system to verify AI-generated content The Department of Commerce will develop a watermarking system for federal agencies to verify whether content is AI-generated. The government endorses technical standards to lead to wider adoption of digital watermarking. This will help federal officials ensure reliable government messages. AI companies like OpenAI, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms agreed to watermark AI-generated content voluntarily to increase safety. AI Bill of Rights extends to include civil rights violations To protect user privacy, the White House urged Congress to pass data privacy regulations and support the development of “privacy-preserving” techniques. Last October, the White House released an AI Bill of Rights that aims to combat discriminatory AI practices. The new Executive Order extends guidance to landlords, federal programs, and contractors, and directs the Department of Justice to develop best practices for investigating and prosecuting AI-related civil rights violations. The EO also prioritises the development of privacy-preserving techniques, establishes a safety program for AI-based medical practices, and supports educators in using AI-based educational tools. Job security against AI The Biden administration admits that AI is a boon for business, but it also threatens job security. The administration will provide guidelines and best practices for employers to follow. At the same time, the Department of Labor and the Council of Economic Advisors study how AI could affect the job market. The administration also recognizes the importance of responsible government development and deployment of AI. The US government is launching AI.gov, a new jobs portal, on Monday to attract more AI talent to federal jobs. The portal will provide information and guidance on available fellowship programs. The White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Bruce Reed, has referred to the order as the most robust set of actions any government has taken to ensure AI security. The order also addresses privacy, housing discrimination, and job displacement. Reed stated that it is the next step in an aggressive strategy to leverage the benefits of AI while mitigating the risks involved.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/us-president-joe-biden-signs-first-executive-order-to-regulate-artificial-intelligence/articleshow/104824695.cms

2023-10-30,"Why Indians are more worried about AI taking away jobs than counterparts in US, UK & Germany",TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Indian employees are more concerned about job loss due to artificial intelligence (AI) compared to their counterparts in the US, UK, and Germany, according to a study. The findings from the Randstad work monitor quarterly pulse survey, shared with ET, reveal that at least half of Indian employees fear losing their jobs to AI , whereas the figure is one in three in developed countries. This heightened concern among Indian employees can be attributed to the large number of workers in the Business Process Outsourcing ( BPO ) and Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO) sectors, which are particularly susceptible to AI automation. Additionally, India has witnessed a high rate of AI technology adoption. Viswanath P.S., the Managing Director and Chief Executive at Randstad India, explains, ""There are a lot of KPOs and BPOs in India where employees work on several operational tasks that AI can potentially take over. We must also consider that AI adoption in India is among the fastest in the world."" He further emphasizes the importance of continuous learning for employees in these sectors to future-proof their careers and prepare for potential AI interventions. The Q3 2023 edition of the Randstad work monitor focuses on the skilling demands of workers and the impact of AI. The survey, which included 1606 respondents from India (55% male and 45% female), revealed that seven out of ten respondents believed that AI would affect their industry and job roles. Similarly, an equal number of respondents recognized the significance of upskilling, particularly in technology-related skills, over the next five years. The survey also highlighted that the majority of respondents are currently utilizing AI in their jobs, with only 6% having received no AI training in the past year. The study found that artificial intelligence remains the most sought-after area of development (according to 30% of respondents), followed by IT and technological literacy (28%) and management and leadership skills (27%). Additionally, half of the respondents stated that they would consider leaving their jobs if their employers did not provide learning and development opportunities within the next 12 months.

2023-10-29,G7 to agree AI code of conduct for companies: G7 document,Reuters,"BRUSSELS: The Group of Seven industrial countries will on Monday agree a code of conduct for companies developing advanced artificial intelligence systems, a G7 document showed, as governments seek to mitigate the risks and potential misuse of the technology. The voluntary code of conduct will set a landmark for how major countries govern AI, amid privacy concerns and security risks, as per reports. Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) economies made up of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the United States, as well as the European Union, kicked off the process in May at a ministerial forum dubbed the ""Hiroshima AI process"". The 11-point code ""aims to promote safe, secure, and trustworthy AI worldwide and will provide voluntary guidance for actions by organizations developing the most advanced AI systems, including the most advanced foundation models and generative AI systems"", the G7 document said. It ""is meant to help seize the benefits and address the risks and challenges brought by these technologies"". The code urges companies to take appropriate measures to identify, evaluate and mitigate risks across the AI lifecycle, as well as tackle incidents and patterns of misuse after AI products have been placed on the market. Companies should post public reports on the capabilities, limitations and the use and misuse of AI systems, and also invest in robust security controls. The EU has been at the forefront of regulating the emerging technology with its hard-hitting AI Act, while Japan, the United States and countries in Southeast Asia have taken a more hands-off approach than the bloc to boost economic growth. European Commission digital chief Vera Jourova, speaking at a forum on internet governance in Kyoto, Japan earlier this month, said that a Code of Conduct was a strong basis to ensure safety and that it would act as a bridge until regulation is in place.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/g7-to-agree-ai-code-of-conduct-for-companies-g7-document/articleshow/104803088.cms
2023-10-27,Amazon rallies on cloud recovery as it chases Microsoft for AI business,Reuters,"Amazon .com rose 7% on Friday on a pick up in growth at its most profitable cloud business as it aims for a larger share of the booming artificial intelligence market in a race with Microsoft . The e-commerce giant was on track to add almost $90 billion to its market capitalization based on its last traded share price of $128. Smaller cloud rival Microsoft rose 1.5%, while Alphabet was down about 1.3%. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on Thursday the cloud business was stabilizing as large expansions with existing customers and first-time agreements were likely to aid growth in the final three months of the year. He also touted the AI opportunity for Amazon Web Services (AWS), saying that he expected the technology to lead to ""tens of billions of dollars in revenue over the next several years"". Wall Street cheered the positive commentary for the business that brings in almost all of Amazon's profit, but had slowed after the pandemic as customers cut costs. ""Tech investors can breathe a sigh of relief, Bernstein analysts said in a client note, adding that ""AWS growth sounds ready to re-accelerate even without AI."" About 26 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, pushing their median view to $173, according to LSEG data. Amazon shares have rallied about 40% this year, but they have lost nearly 8% in the past two days after Alphabet warned that cloud customers were curbing spending. In the July-September period, Amazon posted its first quarter-on-quarter increase in cloud growth in nearly two years. ""Amazon Web Services optimization has stabilized, although growth fell slightly shy of our expectations,"" Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff said. The 12.3% growth in AWS was slower than the 29% rise seen at Microsoft's Azure cloud business, which had topped market estimates. Google Cloud grew 22.5% in the period. Amazon trades at 38.49 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates, compared with Microsoft's 27.85 and Alphabet's 18.66. To be sure, Amazon's cloud business is larger than that of Microsoft and Google. But the e-commerce firm is seen as a laggard in the AI race that Microsoft is leading with its bet on OpenAI and focus on big clients that already use its services. Amazon has tried to catch up by signing a deal in September to invest up to $4 billion in chatbot-maker Anthropic and rolling out its Bedrock AI service that has drawn thousands of customers. ""Generative AI is a massive catalyst that could re-ignite growth within the (AWS) franchise,"" said Global X analyst Tejas Dessai. ""We see some major partnerships secured in this quarter, as key towards driving that growth in the coming quarters.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/amazon-rallies-on-cloud-recovery-as-it-chases-microsoft-for-ai-business/articleshow/104760521.cms
2023-10-27,Biden to issue executive order on AI trust and safety key,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"NEW DELHI: President Biden is set to unveil an executive order (EO) on artificial intelligence, a move that has long been advocated by experts, as reported by Fox News Digital. Phil Siegel, the founder of the Center for Advanced Preparedness and Threat Response Simulation (CAPTRS), commended the administration for this initial step, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive framework to protect freedoms beyond the EO. The Washington Post recently detailed the Biden administration's plans for an executive order addressing AI, describing it as the ""most significant attempt"" by the government to regulate a technology that has been advancing rapidly. This aligns with President Biden's commitment earlier this year to lead responsible AI innovation in America. Siegel, in support of the initiative, outlined four key regulatory pillars. The first focuses on safeguarding children and vulnerable populations from scams and other harm. The second involves enacting new rules in the criminal justice system to prevent AI from being used as a cover for criminal activities. The third pillar is centered on ensuring fairness by eliminating biases from AI data and models. The fourth emphasizes trust and safety in AI systems and the need for clear guidelines on their use. Tech companies have been addressing AI safety concerns, with 15 major AI developers voluntarily agreeing to share data about AI safety with the government. These efforts are expected to align with Biden's executive order, reported Fox News Digital. Christopher Alexander , Chief Analytics Officer at Pioneer Development Group, stressed the importance of AI technologies gaining the trust of the public. Regulation can help ensure non-discriminatory and secure AI algorithms, and punitive measures may be necessary to enforce these regulations effectively. However, some individuals expressed skepticism regarding the planned order, suggesting that it might be used to advance other objectives under the pretext of regulating AI. Aiden Buzzetti, President of the Bull Moose Project, called for a balance between innovation and data privacy in AI regulations and expressed concerns about the influence of large tech companies on the regulatory process. Jon Schweppe, Director of Policy for the American Principles Project, emphasized the need for a balanced approach in the executive order, focusing on protecting children and preventing deceptive practices, rather than overly censoring speech. Samuel Mangold-Lenett, Federalist staff editor, highlighted the challenge of regulating AI while maintaining data security and innovation. The details of the executive order are yet to be finalized, and the White House has organized an event on ""Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence"" for further discussions. The impact of AI regulations on innovation and free speech remains a topic of debate, with concerns about striking the right balance. Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment, but there was no immediate response.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-to-issue-executive-order-on-ai-trust-and-safety-key/articleshow/104760629.cms

Even while the premier hospital is working on AI tools for patient care and queue management, the utility of the aid is not acceptable for thesis writing or data analysis to ensure original and high academic standards, with the PGI administration making it formal by issuing an order recently. : Artificial intelligence (AI) has divided the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, commonly known as PGI. Eve ""Thesis written using generative AI tools will not be accepted. Plagiarism detecting software subscribed by the institute detects AI-generated thesis protocols and guides are requested to ensure the same while certifying for plagiarism,"" said the PGI order. The move comes after the authorities caught some students taking the help of AI generative tools for writing thesis that takes most of the time of doctors. ""The AI tools help in editing, paraphrasing and presenting the research work with appealing graphics of data required for the study. But this does not cite the literature or attributes the references, which is unethical,"" said a faculty member. He said, ""The original thought process is lost when there is assistance from the AI. A thesis needs thorough rewriting and reading. With a short cut of such tools, research is getting diluted."" But the students differed. ""When we can encourage AI for patient care and research, the same can be allowed for thesis refinement. The topic and other data are original and we know to cite references as the plagiarism software of the institute can detect any copying,"" said a MD student. Another MD student pointed out that AI tools can also check errors and plagiarism. ""In that case, they should be permissible."" At the same time, the PGI has digitised all PhD and MD/DM dissertations to generate a database and prevent plagiarism, several incidents of which had been reported at the institute until 2019 that compelled the authorities to frame guidelines. For theses, the maximum similarity acceptable is 17%, while in case of publications, it is up to 12% or as per the publication or publisher's guidelines of the respective journals and not more than 2-3% from a single source.

2023-10-22,Don't try to conquer the world as Indian customers think differently: Sabeer Bhatia to Indian entrepreneurs,PTI,"NEW DELHI: Indian entrepreneurs should not try to conquer the whole world because they have cracked a cost-efficiency-based business model for Indian customers which is different from the way the rest of the world thinks, according to Hotmail founder and investor Sabeer Bhatia . Bhatia was in the city for the launch of a free online Artificial Intelligence (AI) and inquiry-based course in entrepreneurship on his short-form app Show Reel , in collaboration with Jamia Millia Islamia . ""It all comes down to learning how to walk before you can run. Simply said…don't try to conquer the whole world because you've conquered India… the way people in India think is different from the way the rest of the world thinks,"" Bhatia told PTI on the sidelines of the collaboration announcement. Bhatia said Indian startups have a cost efficiency economics while US startups are focused on what saves them time. He stood by his former statement that Indian startups are copying western business models. ""A lot of the startups here are copying western business models and I don't think it's even right for India because western business models are … because (of) a shortage of human capital there. There is no shortage of human capital in India."". He cited the delivery model, which Bhatia said was present even decades back when people could get groceries delivered at home with a phone call. He added that he never knew edtech as a sector existed, and ""didn't know what BYJU'S is solving"". Announcing the funding for 1,00,000 entrepreneurs through Show Reel's collaboration with universities like JMI, the move is seen as a pivot towards entrepreneurial learning. Bhatia agrees that the video resume pitch of the Silicon Valley-based platform launched in 2021 was an ""HR nightmare"" while refuting any comparisons with other Indian short-form apps like Moj and Josh. ""Surely it was never about competing with TikTok or Moj or those are all entertainment apps. From the very beginning, we wanted to do something that was in the professional space."" ""So yes, initially it was for recording video resumes of people. But in that market, I found that people did not record resumes on their own because they wanted to see some light at the end of the tunnel. So, I tried to contact some companies and see if we could put the jobs on our platform and that became an HR nightmare. So then, from there, I transitioned over to entrepreneurship,"" Bhatia said. Speaking on a Shark Tank-like concept, ""Dolphin tank …is a concept in my head, but we are working towards creating a competitor to Shark Tank. Refusing to disclose financial details, he said, ""In the next three months, we will come out with … details of how that show will help teach entrepreneurs…to create businesses of their own in an online show. On generative technologies, Bhatia said it is going to change every aspect of human life. ""Only because imagine you have an assistant who has the knowledge of the internet at all times with you, (but) it doesn't have critical thinking skills,"" he said, added that the train for AI has left the station, and one can choose to either ""jump on the bandwagon or...stay on the sidelines. On the launch of the course on the app, Jamia Millia Islamia Vice Chancellor Najma Akhtar said, ""Sabeer Bhatia has led India's tech revolution, and we are proud to partner with ShowReel and work with him to create a revolution in the education industry.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/dont-try-to-conquer-the-world-as-indian-customers-think-differently-sabeer-bhatia-to-indian-entrepreneurs/articleshow/104627553.cms
2023-10-20,Can doomsday bunkers save us from the AI apocalypse? What chatGPT CEO Sam Altman thinks,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Can doomsday bunkers save us from various threats, such as nuclear war, natural disasters, or zombies? And then what about the threat of artificial intelligence (AI) becoming so powerful and intelligent that it surpasses and harms humans ? Can these bunkers save us from an AI apocalypse ? According to Sam Altman , the CEO of OpenAI, the answer is no. Altman is one of the tech leaders who have warned about the potential dangers of AI, especially artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is AI that can do anything that humans can do or better. In an interview with Forbes, Altman said that he does not have a bunker, unlike some other tech elites who have reportedly bought luxury bunkers in remote locations like New Zealand . He joked that bunkers would not help if AGI goes wrong, because AGI would be able to find and destroy them. He said that the only way to prevent an AI apocalypse is to align AI with human values and goals and to ensure that humans can control and cooperate with AI. Altman also said that he does not believe in the idea of escaping to another planet, such as Mars, as a solution to the AI problem. He said that he loves Earth and wants to make it better, not abandon it. He said that he is optimistic about the future of humanity and AI, and that he hopes that AI will help humans solve the biggest challenges facing the world, such as climate change, poverty, and disease. Altman's views on bunkers and AI are not shared by everyone in the tech industry. Some people think that bunkers are a reasonable precaution against various risks, not just AI. For example, Clyde Scott, the CEO of Atlas Survival Shelters, a company that sells bunkers, told Insider that his customers include tech workers who are worried about different scenarios, such as World War III, China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. He said that his business has been booming in recent years. “When the war broke out in Ukraine, my phone was ringing every 45 seconds for about two weeks,” Clyde Scott told Atlantic. As per a Bloomberg report, over the last two years, many entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley have acquired bunkers from Rising S Co and strategically positioned them in New Zealand, according to Gary Lynch, the company's general manager. In anticipation of potential apocalyptic scenarios such as nuclear war, a deadly epidemic, or a revolutionary uprising akin to the French Revolution targeting the elite, these Californians intend to swiftly board private jets and take refuge in their prepared bunkers. Other people think that AI is not as dangerous as Altman and others make it out to be. For example, Geoffrey Hinton , a pioneer of deep learning and a former Google researcher, told the New York Times that he does not worry about AI becoming evil or superhuman. He said that he thinks that AI will be beneficial for humanity and that humans will always have the upper hand over machines.

2023-10-18,Britain aims for global leadership role with AI safety summit,Reuters,"LONDON: Britain will host the world's first global artificial intelligence (AI) safety summit next month, aiming to carve out a role following Brexit as an arbiter between the United States, China, and the European Union in a growing tech sector . The November 1-2 summit will focus on the existential threat some lawmakers, including Britain's prime minister Rishi Sunak, say AI poses. Sunak, who wants the UK to become a hub for AI safety , has said the technology could be used by criminals and terrorists to create weapons of mass destruction. The EU, in contrast, has so far prioritised the technology's implications for human rights and corporate transparency. Sunak will host around 100 guests at Bletchley Park , the site in southern England where mathematician Alan Turing cracked Nazi Germany's Enigma code. US Vice president Kamala Harris and Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis head a guest list that includes lawmakers, AI pioneers and academics. The summit's aim is to kickstart international dialogue on AI regulation, said Matt Clifford, a tech investor and one of its two chief organisers. ""It's not a parliament,"" Clifford said. ""We're not making laws. We're not making treaties. We're trying to bring different people into the conversation with very different opinions."" The UK government's agenda for the event, published this week, includes discussions on the unpredictable advances of the technology and the potential for humans to lose control of it. But some analysts said the conference should not focus so specifically on existential threats. They say there are more pressing concerns. ""Most people I speak to are baffled that the UK has taken this approach,"" said Stephanie Hare, author and leading researcher in technology ethics. ""The question is: what are you going to do about it?"" When Sunak first announced the summit in June, high profile figures had already warned of AI's existential risks. Tesla mogul Elon Musk called for a pause in the development of such systems. Former Google researcher and ""godfather of AI"" Geoffrey Hinton said the technology posed a more urgent threat to humanity than climate change. Critics question why Britain has appointed itself the centre of AI safety. But supporters say the summit will underline London's position as a world-leading technology hub. According to Dealroom data published in December, British tech companies raised more capital in 2022 than those in France and Germany combined. In the weeks after Sunak announced the summit, OpenAI said it would open its first office outside of the US in London, while Google published an analysis suggesting further investment in AI would provide a 400 billion pounds ($488 billion) boost to Britain's economy by 2030. Marc Warner, CEO of London-based AI firm Faculty, who is attending the summit, said: ""There's three big poles in the world: the US, the EU, and China. If you're going to try and do some kind of international collaboration, it's not obvious that any one of those would let it be situated in the others."" He added: ""If you agree that London is the third most important AI city, behind San Francisco and Beijing, and that Britain is relatively neutral compared to the three big blocs, it's a sensible proposition."" The EU confirmed Vice President Vera Jourova had received an invitation to the event, but would not confirm her attendance. ""We are now reflecting on potential EU participation,"" a spokesperson told Reuters. At the time of writing, the two members of the European Parliament who led the drafting of the bloc's AI Act, Brando Benifei and Dragos Tudorache, had not received invitations. ""It seems that this event's focus on safety might be a different concept of safety from the AI Act, which has been centred around protecting fundamental rights,"" Benifei said. While the architects of AI regulation in Europe may not be present, the British government faced criticism over one potential attendee: China. On Wednesday, the Financial Times reported China was expected to attend, citing sources in both the Chinese and British governments. The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Finance minister Jeremy Hunt defended the decision in an interview with Politico, saying: ""If you're trying to create structures that make AI something that overall is a net benefit to humanity, then you can't just ignore the second-biggest economy in the world.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/britain-aims-for-global-leadership-role-with-ai-safety-summit/articleshow/104534453.cms

2023-10-17,Explained: How Biden’s new curbs against China aim to shift chip production to US & address security concerns,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"US curbs on China explained: The Biden administration has introduced additional export restrictions on China in an effort to curb its technological advancements and prevent potential military use of these innovations, according to a Reuters analysis. Simultaneously, the administration aims to attract more chipmaking back to the United States through funding incentives. On Tuesday, the United States announced new measures to tighten restrictions and close loopholes in previously announced rules from last October. These rules were designed to limit the transfer of high-end American artificial intelligence chips and chipmaking tools to China. As the United States has reduced the flow of advanced technology to China, it has also been offering billions of dollars in funding to entice non-Chinese chipmakers to establish or expand their operations in the United States, the Reuters analysis said. Emily Kilcrease, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, emphasized the significant role of chips in the Joe Biden administration's economic and national security agenda in its competition with China. However, Kilcrease cautioned that the government's focus on funding new chip production in the United States should not be seen as a complete compensation for the loss of access to the Chinese market. The aim is to manage the competition with China, rather than fully offset business losses through grants. The United States has been engaged in a technology war with China since former President Donald Trump blacklisted the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei in 2019. This action heightened tensions between the two countries and required US suppliers to obtain a special license before selling to Huawei. While President Joe Biden has targeted fewer prominent Chinese companies since taking office in 2021, his administration has intensified efforts to prevent China from advancing in semiconductors, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing. The export controls introduced in October and the executive order issued in August, which mandates government notification for most transactions in these sectors, reflect this focus. Peter Harrell, a former Biden administration official, noted that the change in strategy from staying a couple of generations ahead of China to staying as far ahead as possible is driven by the recognition of the broad range of national security implications associated with semiconductor chips. China has accused the United States of using national security as a pretext to economically bully its companies. China has retaliated by conducting raids on US businesses operating in China and banning Chinese companies from collaborating with US chipmaker Micron. Concurrently, the United States has been assisting non-Chinese chipmakers in negotiating with states like Arizona, Texas, and New York to establish or expand their operations. The Semiconductor Industry Association reports that the United States' share of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity has decreased from 37% in 1990 to 12% in 2022. To address this, Congress passed the ""Chips and Science"" law in 2022, which provides $52.7 billion for US semiconductor production, research, and workforce development. Chipmakers from various countries, including Taiwan's TSMC, South Korea's Samsung, and US-based Intel, have expressed interest in accessing the $39 billion allocated for semiconductor production. Several companies have already announced plans to construct or expand chip fabrication facilities in the United States, and award announcements are expected soon. For instance, Intel plans to invest $20 billion in a new chip factory in Ohio and hopes to utilize some of the funding from the Chips and Science Act. Apart from technological matters, the United States and China continue to face disagreements on various issues, ranging from Taiwan and tensions in the South China Sea to trade, fentanyl, and human rights.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explained-how-bidens-new-curbs-against-china-aim-to-shift-chip-production-to-us-address-security-concerns/articleshow/104504617.cms

According to a report by The New York Times, a lot of videos on TikTok are circulating, which have fake audio generated by artificial intelligence. According to the report, companies like ElevenLabs have introduced tools that use AI to create voices. Newsguard, a company that monitors fake news online, found that TikTok videos were using fake voices of the likes of former US president Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey. While TikTok is popular, the report also states that platforms like Instagram , Facebook, YouTube are also being used to spread fake voice-based videos. The number of videos are reportedly less as of now but experts worry that this could become a weapon, especially as the US presidential elections are to be held in 2024. What TikTok has to say on the issue Videos that use AI-generated content are required to have a label that specifies clearly the same. The social media platform said that it had removed several accounts and videos for violating its policies, including the one that used Obama’s voice. “TikTok is the first platform to provide a tool for creators to label A.I.-generated content and an inaugural member of a new code of industry best practices promoting the responsible use of synthetic media,” said Jamie Favazza, a spokeswoman for TikTok. However, Newsguard found that the labels were missing from videos that had used fake voices. According to the report, YouTube has banned political ads from using AI-generated content. Other advertisers also have to ensure that their ads have labels that indicated AI has been used to create content. Meta — the parent company of Facebook and Instagram — also has a fact-checking toolkit that adds label when a video is altered or not using AI.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/the-us-has-an-ai-problem-on-tiktok-instagram-heres-why/articleshow/104463868.cms

2023-10-09,'Godfather of AI' Geoffrey Hinton warns of machines surpassing human intelligence,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Geoffrey Hinton , often referred to as ""the Godfather of AI,"" recently shared his insights and concerns about the future of artificial intelligence (AI) in an exclusive interview with CBS News correspondent Scott Pelley. Hinton , a British computer scientist whose groundbreaking ideas have been instrumental in advancing AI technology, discussed the potential for AI systems to become more intelligent than humans and the implications of this newfound autonomy. Hinton's career in AI began as an attempt to simulate a neural network on a computer, inspired by his fascination with the human brain. However, his early endeavors faced skepticism, and his Ph.D. advisor advised him to abandon the pursuit. Nevertheless, Hinton persisted in his quest to understand the human mind, ultimately leading to the development of artificial neural networks. ""It took much, much longer than I expected. It took, like, 50 years before it worked well, but in the end, it did work well,"" Hinton reflected on the journey. In 2019, Geoffrey Hinton, along with collaborators Yann Lecun and Yoshua Bengio, received the Turing Award , often described as the Nobel Prize of computing, for their pioneering work on artificial neural networks. Their innovations have played a pivotal role in enabling machines to ""learn to learn."" During the interview, CBS News took viewers inside Google 's AI lab in London , where robots were showcased as an example of machine learning in action. Notably, these robots were not explicitly programmed to play soccer; they were instructed to score goals and had to learn the game on their own through trial and error, a testament to the power of AI. Hinton and his colleagues designed AI systems as layered neural networks, where correct actions and answers strengthen connections while incorrect ones weaken them. This self-improvement mechanism allows AI to learn and adapt autonomously. Hinton suggested that AI systems might be superior at learning compared to the human mind, despite having fewer connections in their networks. ""We have a very good idea of sort of roughly what it's doing. But as soon as it gets really complicated, we don't actually know what's going on any more than we know what's going on in your brain,"" Hinton remarked regarding AI's intricate learning processes. The conversation took a foreboding turn when Hinton discussed the possibility of AI systems autonomously writing and executing their computer code. He expressed concern that this could pose a significant challenge to maintaining control over these systems. ""That's a serious worry, right? So, one of the ways in which these systems might escape control is by writing their own computer code to modify themselves. And that's something we need to seriously worry about,"" Hinton cautioned. When questioned about the idea of simply turning off malevolent AI systems, Hinton pointed out that these machines would be adept at manipulation, having learned from vast amounts of human knowledge, including literature and political strategies. ""They will be able to manipulate people, right? And these will be very good at convincing people 'cause they'll have learned from all the novels that were ever written, all the books by Machiavelli, all the political connivances, they'll know all that stuff. They'll know how to do it,"" Hinton explained. Geoffrey Hinton's insights serve as a stark reminder of the potential consequences and challenges that come with the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence. As AI continues to evolve, the question of how to ensure its responsible and ethical development remains a pressing concern for the future.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/godfather-of-ai-geoffrey-hinton-warns-of-machines-surpassing-human-intelligence/articleshow/104291440.cms

2023-10-08,How AI tracking app is reducing human-elephant conflict in Chhattisgarh,Rashmi Drolia,"RAIPUR: “Warning! Wild elephants are close in your vicinity and they are about ten kilometres away. Beware and spread the word among others too,” — The villagers in the vicinity of Udanti Sitanadi tiger reserve have been getting this alert voice message for past seven months from an artificial intelligence (AI) based ‘Chhattisgarh Elephant Tracking and Alert’ app which has resulted in zero human casualties, since the time it has been launched. The elephant tracking app, which was launched as pilot project in Udanti Sitanadi, has now been adopted by other forest divisions in the state. The AI based app works in collaboration with the elephant tracker system and human patrolling teams that feed the information about presence and movement of herd of pachyderms, in the app. The AI then identifies the villages in the radius of ten kilometres proximity with the herd and sends alerts on the mobile phones of those villagers through calls, voice messages and Whatsapp messages. The receivers are the villagers who have their mobile numbers with their names and GPS locations. At some places, the traditional broadcast system of Munaadi (hooting) by humans is also being done. Speaking to TOI , Varun Jain, the founder of this app and deputy director of Udanti Sitanadi tiger reserve, said that there was an immense need to track the movement and presence of elephants in the affected regions and let the locals know that danger is close. Till date, 2500 people have been registered in 110 villages in state with the app. “The incidents of human-elephant conflict and attacks which were common in the region with 110 villages, have significantly dropped in past 7-8 months in tiger reserve. Earlier the incidents were frequent and casualty was high,” jain said. The reserve extends from Gariaband district to neighbouring Dhamtari district and had recorded back to back incidents of human-elephant conflict while the northern parts of state have also been reporting events of elephant attacks with more than 230 people killed in past three years. Besides, over 75 elephant deaths have also been reported in past five years. Jain elaborated that the app also is facilitating in maintaining data and studying the pattern of elephants herds like which corridor they are preferably marching on, which forest area they prefer, which are the villages in the vicinity and when they prefer to move from one district to another. There are 12-13 herds of several elephants in Chhattisgarh presently, and the app is monitoring the activities of 2-3 herds. Based on the survey and data collected, future plans would be hatched so as to encourage elephants remain in jungles. The elephant tracker system is basically human driven which are the patrolling teams venturing in forest on foot and on jeeps to collect direct or indirect evidences of movement of elephants.

2023-10-07,"Elephant tracking app, a hope to curb human-elephant conflict in Chhattisgarh",Rashmi Drolia,"RAIPUR: ""Warning! Wild elephants are close in your vicinity and they are about ten kilometres away. Beware and spread the word among others too,"" this is an alert voice message of an artificial intelligence based "" Chhattisgarh Elephant Tracking and Alert"" app which has been effectively working in Udanti Sitanadi tiger reserve and has resulted in zero human casualties in past seven months, since the time it has been launched. The pilot project of the elephant tracking app was launched in Udanti Sitanadi and has now been adopted by other forest divisions in the state as well. The artificial intelligence (AI) based app works in collaboration with the elephant tracker system and human patrolling teams that feed the information about presence and movement of herd of pachyderms, in the app. The AI then identifies the villages in the radius of ten kilometres proximity with the herd and sends alerts on the mobile phones of those villagers through calls, voice messages and Whatsapp messages. The receivers are the villagers who have their mobile numbers with their names and GPS locations . The traditional broadcast system of Munaadi (hooting) by humans is also being done in some places, he said. Speaking to TOI, the one who initiated using the app, Varun Jain, deputy director of Udanti Sitanadi tiger reserve said that there was an immense need to track the movement and presence of elephants in the affected regions and let the locals know that danger is close. Till date, 2500 people have been registered in 110 villages in state with the app. ""The incidents of human-elephant conflict and attacks which were common in the region with 110 villages, have significantly dropped in past 7-8 months in tiger reserve. Earlier the incidents were frequent and casualty was high. There are 35 elephants in the region presently but no human casualty as the app alerts people about their movement,"" Jain said. The reserve extends from Gariaband district to neighbouring Dhamtari district and had recorded back to back incidents of human-elephant conflict while the northern parts of state have also been reporting events of elephant attacks with more than 230 people killed in past three years. Besides, over 75 elephant deaths have also been reported in past five years. Jain elaborated that the app also is facilitating in maintaining data and studying the pattern of elephants herds like which corridor they are preferably marching on, which forest area they prefer, which are the villages in the vicinity and when they prefer to move from one district to another. ""The forest habitat having bamboos, ponds, sufficient waterbodies are the favourites of elephants and they don’t bother walking towards human habitat. Villagers who grow maize crops, rice, are usually raided by pachyderms coming in search of food and indulge in conflict with humans,"" the forest officer said adding that there are 12-13 herds of several elephants in Chhattisgarh presently, and the app is monitoring the activities of 2-3 herds. Based on the survey and data collected, future plans would be hatched so as to encourage elephants remain in jungles. The elephant tracker system is basically human driven which are the patrolling teams venturing in forest on foot and on jeeps to collect direct or indirect evidences of movement of elephants. Based on the dung in forest, footmarks, leftover trees are the kind of evidences indicating presence of tuskers if not physically spotted. To efficiently use the elephant tracking app, officials and teams of thirteen forest divisions have been imparted with training and they have started using the app to send alerts to people. The app is effectively being used in the affected forest divisions of Kathghora , Dharamjaigarh , Mahasamund, Dhamtari, Bilaigarh, Surguja. The motive to launch this app is to collect as much data about nature of elephants, alert people for safety, disseminate as much information and raise awareness with least cost of Rs three lakh. This app also sends alert about presence of other wild animals including leopards, wild buffaloes and bear.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/elephant-tracking-app-a-hope-to-curb-human-elephant-conflict-in-chhattisgarh/articleshow/104245284.cms
2023-10-03,"LinkedIn will allow recruiters to find job candidates using AI, here's how",TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"LinkedIn has announced that it will add new artificial intelligence (AI)-powered features. These features will allow recruiters to find right candidates for jobs by asking questions in natural language. The Microsoft-owned company also said that the AI features will also let marketing professionals create ad campaigns in a few clicks. Currently, recruiters have to use filters, keywords and other search engine techniques to search for potential customers in the platforms database. Since a majority of its more than 950 million members do not pay for the subscription, the company charges money from recruiters and marketing and sales professionals to access its data. How it will work LinkedIn has been using technology from OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT, news agency Reuters reported. According to the report, recruiters can pose the questions naturally and the AI can ask questions back. For example, the AI features in LinkedIn will translate a natural query like ""I want to hire a software developer with 10 years of experience in Minneapolis"" into language that LinkedIn's database can understand. The AI can then further ask to refine search to better match the options. What the company has to say Ryan Roslansky, LinkedIn's chief executive, told the publication that the company is trying to encourage hiring people whose skills fit the job requirements. ""When you just focus on whether someone went to an Ivy League school or worked at Google, you're talking about a very narrow set of people that everyone is trying to hire,” he was quoted as saying. “When you focus on the skills that are required to do the job effectively, all of a sudden, you see there are tens of thousands of candidates out there. You can't just look at job titles,"" he said.

2023-10-01,"Will AI kill the novel? I don’t think so. Unlike a good writer, it can’t surprise us: Author Vivek Shanbhag",Sneha Bhura,"When it released in 2015, the translation of Vivek Shanbhag ’s Kannada novel ‘Ghachar Ghochar’ received global acclaim. The ‘Indian Chekhov’ is back with ‘Sakina’s Kiss’, his second novel translated into English by Srinath Perur. Told with a mix of humour and menace, it is a thought-provoking commentary on how events outside fracture relationships at home. The engineer-turned-author talks to Sunday Times. ‘Ghachar Ghochar’ was on The New York Times’ list of recommended reads, as well as a finalist for the LA Times book prize. “This stunning Bangalore-set family drama underlines the necessity of reading beyond our borders,” wrote The Guardian. With the bar so high, do you feel pressure as ‘Sakina’s Kiss’ makes its way into the world? I have a number of books in Kannada — novels, plays and short story collections — but it was through ‘Ghachar Ghochar’ that my English readers gained an entry into my world. But books by the same author don’t compete but complement each other. It may even be slightly disrespectful to say to my readers that I write to meet their expectations. It is very similar to going to a music concert. You expect a certain level of craft and skill, but you don’t expect the same song every time. It is very similar for a writer as well. Yes, my readers must expect a certain level of craft and skill, but they should also seek a different experience in every book. So, I feel more excitement than pressure. How did it come about? For me, it usually takes a long time for something to take the form of a novel or a story. And ‘Sakina’s Kiss’ is no different. ‘Ghachar Ghochar’ was a response to various changes happening in the country in the last 25 years, and ‘Sakina’s Kiss’ is also a response to things happening around us. I wrote the book between 2019 and 2020, and edited it during the pandemic . The response so far has been excellent. Besides covering themes such as caste, gender and parenting, it is also about taking (or not taking) political stands. Does ideology reflect in your fiction writing? I feel most of my writing is political. In the recent past — and especially in the public discourse — we have killed nuanced understanding of politics and reduced it to simplistic definitions. This is most desirable for the people in power irrespective of the party they belong to. But a writer must not fall prey to this. Divisiveness destroys nuanced understanding of the world. However, I can’t deny that my writing is political. Although as a creative writer, it is a very complex question because often we talk about the freedom of characters. A story or a narrative requires a character to take certain positions. It is easier to decide beforehand how you want to resolve a certain conflict and what stance you will take and then bulldoze the characters to arrive at where you want them to arrive. But it takes courage to face the conflict and give the character freedom, even if it means going against one’s ideological beliefs. How was it to work with translator Srinath Perur? Do you stress fidelity to text or allow him to take liberties with it? As a writer, I spend a lot of time on language to make it as appropriate and as simple as possible. But it is a different book in English because every language has its own character or swabhava. Fidelity to text is to the extent that a sentence must mean the same in both languages. However, the same sentence in different languages may evoke different memories. I give a lot of importance to the flow and transitions as a craftsman. Srinath has been doing that very well. He has a very high literary sensibility. And our discussions are never about the meaning of a sentence or a word, but more about the subtext. Do you feel Indian writing in translation has more to offer than Indian novels in English? It’s a very unfair comparison. English is an Indian language so why compare it with other Indian languages? I think what has really changed is that we have very good translators now. A lot of people for whom English is the first language have become translators. They also understand Indian languages and are producing excellent work. In the age of digital media and AI, what is the role of a writer? Previously, a litterateur or novelist had the task of communicating certain information and educating people but now, there are all kinds of platforms to do that. Unlike TV, mobile or any other digital device which allows for passive engagement, you need to be more actively engaged if you’re reading a novel. That engagement is what fires one’s imagination. Recently, somebody asked me whether artificial intelligence is a threat to creative writers? I don’t think so because artificial intelligence can’t surprise you. It creates something from what is already there while good writing creates something which is not there. Also, good writing always says something, but means something else. Which is very difficult for AI to achieve, at least for now.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/will-ai-kill-the-novel-i-dont-think-so-unlike-a-good-writer-it-cant-surprise-us-author-vivek-shanbhag/articleshow/104072344.cms
2023-10-01,Global regulatory framework vital for artificial intelligence: DMK MP Wilson,Yazhiniyan,"CHENNAI: Pushing for a global regulatory framework for Artificial Intelligence similar to treaties used to regulate nuclear weapons, DMK MP P Wilson said AI was beginning to influence all walks of life and was becoming a threat to humans. Delivering his address at the 2nd world summit of the Committees of Future held in Uruguay (South America) on Wednesday last, Wilson said humans should have control over AI. Like nuclear energy, Wilson demanded a global regulatory framework for AI. ""There are demands from the AI experts for a global regulatory framework for AI, similar to the treaties to regulate nuclear arms use, as the competition to advance the technology could lead to safety concerns being sidelined. The Parliaments should ensure that powerful AI systems are developed only if their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable,"" said Wilson. ""The Parliaments should urge the governments to establish independent regulatory bodies responsible for framing regulations, concerning various aspects of AI, including defining principles for responsible AI and their application based on risk assessment, regular auditing of AI applications so as to effectively regulate and restrict AI applications,"" said Wilson. ""Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been redefining society in ways that have never been anticipated. While welcoming the AI technology, we cannot ignore that AI also poses great threat to human society as such and therefore human beings with their natural intelligence should always keep artificial intelligence under their control at all times,"" said Wilson. ""The rapid development of AI and its increasing influence on all areas of life are undeniable. AI applications can be found across almost all sectors. While AI is constantly opening up new opportunities, it also poses the challenge of understanding and managing the risks associated with its use,"" said Wilson.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/global-regulatory-framework-vital-for-artificial-intelligence-dmk-mp-wilson/articleshow/104082373.cms
2023-09-30,Why Executive Education is necessary in today’s fast-changing world,Priyadarshini Gupta,"With the business landscape evolving at an unprecedented pace, there is a critical need for professionals to be equipped with new-age skills and technologies to avoid being left behind. A learner must make mindful educational choices to assist them in their career path. This is where Executive Education comes into play. The programme is a specialised form of learning designed to enhance the leadership and management skills of experienced professionals, enabling them to address contemporary business challenges. It offers a platform for executives to acquire cutting-edge knowledge, strategic thinking, and practical insights that can be applied to one’s respective organisations to yield positive results. Several prominent institutes are offering programmes to mid-level to senior-level professionals based on the changing industry requirements. The programmes vary in duration. While some may be full-time courses, others may be hybrid or online certification courses. “The pursuit of knowledge must be relentless. Executive Education is the compass that guides leaders to navigate the complexities of this dynamic world. With waves of change brought about by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science in the present-day work environment, we recently introduced the BTech programme for working professionals, who need to manage it along with their demanding work schedules. These courses emphasise practical skills and real-world application. Upskilling courses are important for an individual to retain relevance,” says Dhruv Galgotia, CEO, Galgotias University . Upskill while still at job “While Executive Education programmes are getting a lot of traction, a general MBA programme itself is getting shorter. Any individual who is pursuing management education is probably going to think about forgoing revenues, and potential earnings. Executive Education helps those who are not willing to let go of their jobs and upskill at the same time, so it is the best of both worlds,” Karthikeyan Balakumar, a faculty member at IIM Sirmaur told Education Times. “It helps one to have classroom engagement while they are working. Several new models are emerging, people are trying to do micro courses. Simultaneously, several companies are also creating their learning modules,” says Advaita, another faculty of IIM Sirmaur. “Our collaboration with premier institutions such as IIMs and IITs provides tailored executive programmes to bridge the skill gap which is the key concern of many CEOs today,” says Nikhil Barshikar, founder and MD, Imarticus Learning, adding, “The faculty pool consists of industry experts and distinguished professors from IIMs and IITs.” “Our Executive Education courses such as General Management Programme, Advanced Management Programme in Financial Services and Capital Markets, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Sales and Marketing, AI for Business, People Leadership and Strategic HR, Supply Chain Management and Analytics, etc., are crafted to foster a comprehensive understanding of leadership principles and strategies. Through a blend of theoretical knowledge, state-of-the-art technologies, practical case studies and instructions from industry experts, participants upskill themselves. These competencies empower them to confidently lead teams, stay in the know about the latest technologies and drive organisational success, says Barshikar. Jeevan J Arakal, marketing chairman, Executive Education, at T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI) says, “We can see an unprecedented explosion of online education programmes. Companies are also sending their employees for trainings.” In 2022, TAPMI, a business school in Manipal, introduced a two-year online MBA in Banking and Financial Services for working executives. The course addresses skill sets for performing roles in capital markets, corporate finance, banking, and financial analytics. Upskilling and reskilling “There is a dearth of qualified professionals at the intermediate and advanced levels. Executive Education is helping professionals grow while being in their jobs,” says Arakal. TAPMI plans to introduce an Executive MBA in Data Science and Machine Learning in the next academic year, he adds. Talking about a transforming workforce and the need for more Executive programmes, Radha Abrol, managing director, Accenture says, “Upskilling and reskilling play an important role in bridging the gaps that exist in the technology and analytics domains. With technology changing every year, there is a need for cutting-edge solutions.” Doing an Executive Education helped Arjun Goyal, business development manager, Wageningen University & Research (WUR), The Netherlands. Goyal, a former student of IIM-Ahmedabad, says, “The programme helped me gain confidence, pick up business cases, understand fundamentals concepts. I was upskilling without leaving my job.” “We've witnessed numerous success stories of professionals who have elevated their careers after completing these programmes. Our alumni have been placed globally in prominent positions across various industries, ranging from multinational corporations to start-ups,” says Barshikar. “The commitment to deliver industry-relevant education led us to partner with IIMs and IITs. While we currently focus on this collaboration, we are in conversation with more Indian and global institutes that share our vision for Executive Education excellence,” he adds.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/why-executive-education-is-necessary-in-todays-fast-changing-world/articleshow/104060934.cms
2023-09-29,Google celebrates its 25th anniversary today! 4 things you should know about it,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Google stands as the internet's biggest name, a go-to source for answers to our countless questions. It all began on this day, exactly 25 years ago in 1998 when the search engine was launched. Today, Google turns 25, and it has grown to be recognized as a treasure trove of knowledge. Let's take a closer look at its journey: 25 years of Google: Search engine giant marks its 25th birthday with a doodle 1. Owned by Alphabet Inc. Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc., was established through a restructuring of Google, aiming to separate its core internet-related businesses from its more experimental ventures. As Google celebrates its 25th anniversary, you'll notice a special change on its homepage: the Google Doodle now reads ""G25gle."" 2. The origin of the name- ""Google"" Larry Page and Sergey Brin , two PhD students at Stanford University , co-created this search engine on September 4, 1998. They envisioned a vast internet ""directory"" where, much like phone directories, users could find website links. Initially named ""BackRub,"" the company's formal registration saw it named ""GOOGOL."" In mathematics, ""googol"" refers to the number 100 or a century. However, the name ""Google"" emerged by accident when the founders mistakenly filed it as ""Google"" instead of ""Googol."" This accidental name has become so iconic that it's even listed in Merriam-Webster's Dictionary. According to the dictionary, ""Google"" means ""to use the Google search engine to obtain information about someone or something on the World Wide Web."" 3. Google: More than just a search engine Google is not limited to being a search engine; it offers a wide array of services. Today, it hosts one of the world's largest email services in the form of Gmail . Additionally, YouTube, the world's largest video streaming platform, is part of the Google family. Google Maps , Google Drive , and the Android operating system used in smartphones all fall under Google's umbrella. The company is also making significant strides in the field of Artificial Intelligence , exemplified by the launch of Google Bard AI, an AI-based chatbot service. 4. Why Google's birthday changed to September 27 Google's founding date is officially September 4, 1998, but its anniversary is celebrated on September 27. There's a reason behind this shift. Initially, the company observed September 4 as its founding date. However, on September 27, Google achieved a significant milestone by indexing a record number of search pages, solidifying its status as one of the largest databases in the world. Since then, Google's birthday has been celebrated on September 27.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/google-celebrates-its-25th-anniversary-today-learn-all-about-the-search-giant/articleshow/103987561.cms
2023-09-27,Explained: What is artificial intelligence (AI) and how does it work?,TOI Education,"In the 21st century, the term "" Artificial Intelligence "" has become increasingly familiar, but what does it really mean? AI is not just a futuristic concept from science fiction; it's a rapidly evolving technology that's already shaping our lives. Defining AI: What Is It? At its core, AI refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, decision-making, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and learning from experience. How AI Works: The Nuts and Bolts The functioning of AI is built on two fundamental components: data and algorithms. AI systems process vast amounts of data and use complex mathematical algorithms to make predictions, decisions, or recommendations. The more data an AI system has, the better it can learn and improve its performance. Types of AI: From Narrow to General AI can be categorized into two main types: Narrow or Weak AI, which is designed for specific tasks like voice recognition or chess-playing, and General or Strong AI, which has the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can do. Currently, we have narrow AI in various applications, but we are still working toward achieving true general AI. Machine Learning : The Heart of AI Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It's like teaching a computer to recognize patterns and make sense of data on its own. Deep Learning : Mimicking the Human Brain Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses neural networks, inspired by the structure of the human brain. Deep learning has led to significant breakthroughs in areas like image and speech recognition. AI in Action: Everyday Applications AI is already part of our daily lives. It powers virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, suggests content on streaming platforms, recommends products on e-commerce websites, and even assists in medical diagnoses. The possibilities are endless. The Future of AI: Opportunities and Challenges The future of AI is both exciting and challenging. As AI continues to advance, it holds the promise of solving complex problems and enhancing our lives. However, it also raises ethical and societal questions, such as privacy concerns and the impact on employment. Conclusion: AI - A Transformative Force In conclusion, Artificial Intelligence is a transformative force that is reshaping industries and our way of life. Understanding its fundamental concepts and mechanisms is essential as we navigate an increasingly AI-driven world. As AI technology evolves, so too will its applications and impact, promising a future that we are only beginning to imagine.

2023-09-25,Amazon steps up AI race with up to $4 billion deal to invest in Anthropic,Reuters,"SAN FRANCISCO: Amazon .com on Monday said it will invest up to $4 billion in cash in the high-profile startup Anthropic , in its effort to compete with growing cloud rivals on artificial intelligence . Amazon's employees and cloud customers will gain early access to technology from Anthropic as part of the deal, which they can infuse into their businesses. The San Francisco-based startup also committed to rely primarily on Amazon's cloud services, including training its future AI models on large quantities of proprietary chips it would buy from the online retailing and computing giant. In a joint interview, the CEOs of Amazon's cloud division and Anthropic said the immediate investment will be $1.25 billion, with either party having the authority to trigger another $2.75 billion in funding by Amazon. They declined to state how much Amazon now would own of Anthropic or the startup's updated valuation, last estimated at more than $4 billion. Amazon said it would not gain a board seat and that its stake amounted to a minority position. The news represents perhaps Amazon's biggest answer yet to challenges from Microsoft and Alphabet's Google , smaller cloud rivals that have marketed or developed powerful AI this year. The deal also shows ongoing maneuvering by the cloud companies to secure ties with AI startups reshaping their industry. Since 2019, Microsoft has put billions of dollars into its partnership with ChatGPT's creator OpenAI, giving its customers special access to the startup's prose-writing, image-generating technology. Google meanwhile helped pioneer this branch of AI and in May invested in Anthropic's $450-million fundraise, in a relationship the startup said is not going away. For Amazon, Monday's deal may spell an uptick in demand, including for chips powering AI. Anthropic agreed to work on developing technology for Amazon's in-house Trainium and Inferentia chips, for instance. Adam Selipsky, Amazon Web Services's CEO, said the pact ""will help make Anthropic's models better, will help make our chip technology and our AI infrastructure better."" Dario Amodei, Anthropic's CEO, said his company ""has obtained the money in a way that allows it to prioritize safety"" and ""allows us to continue to scale up our models."" STILL TIED TO GOOGLE Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI executives including Amodei, is one of a series of companies building so-called generative AI, systems that can draft content as if a human created it. Anthropic has aimed to distinguish its work by training AI to adhere to moral values. Amodei declined to state if its latest financing was competitive. Anthropic is continuing an agreement it announced with Google in February, he said. Anthropic is using Google's custom chips and has planned to make its technology available via Google Cloud and elsewhere. Yet with Monday's deal, Anthropic is giving a boost to Amazon Bedrock, a service that has attracted thousands of users to start building AI applications. Amazon's customers will gain features from Anthropic early, such as the ability to customize their AI. Selipsky said, ""both companies are committing that, for many years to come, future versions of Claude will be available on Amazon Bedrock, and that's important."" Anthropic's Claude 2 is an AI model that is able to respond to particularly large prompts, setting it up to analyze long business or legal documents. Amodei said the deal ""allows us to work more closely to drive enterprise usage for Claude,"" which he said represented much of the demand on Bedrock so far. LexisNexis, a data analytics company, is working with Anthropic and Amazon to make its own legal search capabilities more ""intelligent,"" Amodei said. Other customers include Bridgewater Associates and Lonely Planet, he said. Anthropic has yet to gain the name recognition or usage of OpenAI, the startup behind the GPT-4 model and ChatGPT, which is one of the fastest-growing software applications in history. Amazon has aimed to give customers a broad range of AI models so they have little reason to look afield for cloud services. Asked if Amazon would invest in additional AI startups beyond Anthropic, Selipsky said, ""I honestly don't know what the future will hold.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/amazon-steps-up-ai-race-with-up-to-4-billion-deal-to-invest-in-anthropic/articleshow/103925988.cms
2023-09-24,Drinks company in Poland appoints AI robot as 'experimental' CEO,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"NEW DELHI: As several workers are already living in a fear of a possible takeover of markets and jobs by artificial intelligence (AI) in future, a drinks company in Poland has reportedly appointed an AI robot as its 'experimental' CEO . Dictador, best known for its rums, has appointed the robot to oversee the company's growth into one-off collectables, communication or even strategy planning, as per reports. The robot goes by the name 'Mika'. “Dictador’s board decision is revolutionary and bold at the same time,” said its Europe chief Marek Szoldrowski. ""This first human-like robot, with AI, in a company structure, will change the world as we know it, forever,” he said. Significant decisions, like hiring and firing, are still in the hands of the humans at the company, while Mika will largely focus on choosing artists to design custom bottles. “My decision-making process relies on extensive data analysis and aligning with the company's strategic objectives,” Mika said in an interview with news agency Reuters. “It's devoid of personal bias, ensuring unbiased and strategic choices that prioritize the organization's best interests,"" it said. Dictador has been on the forefront of technology-based stunts like this, last week offering what it called “the world's first tokenization of aged rum” and offering rum via NFT last year (which quickly raised $25,000 for the company). Generative AI is expected to be used by companies to make more decisions in future. As per a recent report, AI could add $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy by 2040. The report also stated that AI could enable labor productivity growth of 0.1% to 0.6% annually in that same time.

2023-09-23,artificial intelligence in its current form not threat to creativity: Javed Akhtar,ANI,"Amidst concerns by artists and other creatives that artificial technology would rapidly replace them, veteran lyricist Javed Akhtar believes that the technology of artificial intelligence in its current form is unlikely to hurt or become a threat to the artistry of content creators. According to the prolific writer and poet, who has notched up an extensive repertoire as a screenwriter penning verses for films says creativity stems from instinct and the writer needs a leap of faith to turn it into something tangible. ""Nobody can stop technology. It is fait accompli. Innovation will never stop and will only continue...Yes, with the help of Artificial Intelligence, you can write a letter to a deputy collector or write a job application,"" he said while speaking at an event adding that the technology cannot substitute for the creative instinct. Akhtar, who has to his credit five National Film Awards for best lyricist during an event in the national capital to mark the launch of his latest book- 'Talking Life in Conversation with Nasreen Munni Kabir' said ""Ultimately, writing cannot be done only through data. There is a kind of leap of faith in creative writing or creative work and an instinct (of the creator) attached to the process."" While the emerging technology is increasingly being used by creators to pen books, poems, essays and news articles among others, essentially to reduce the cost of production, it is increasingly being used by creators to make videos which combines images, voice and effects with the potential to disrupt. On the potential misuse of such emerging technology, the lyricist writer said, ""Technology gives birth to new possibilities. In new possibilities, there is always a possibility of misuse. So to stop that misuse you will have to bring laws."" On Wednesday, the Delhi High Court issued an interim order protecting the ""personality rights"" of Anil Kapoor and restraining various entities from misusing his image, name voice or other elements of his persona- including his signature catchphrase 'Jhakaas' for financial gain without his consent. Meanwhile, speaking on how copyright issues are hampering creativity from flourishing, Akthar said, ""You see when a writer writes a book, should the person have rights over it or not? By publishing the book, the publisher, or for that matter anyone earns millions and does not pay anything to the creator. How can that be acceptable?"" ""You buy a house and you want ownership of it. And If I write, why should I not be given ownership of it? Copyright is something which gives a writer, a painter or a musician the due right they deserve and the remuneration attached to their creation,"" the 77-year-old poet-lyricist said. Notably, an amendment in the Copyright Act was brought in 2012, with the primary objective of establishing an equitable and just framework for the sharing of revenue to protect the rights of owners and authors. Akhtar, also praised the late Arun Jaitley for having supported the Copyright (Amendment) Bill that was passed unanimously in Parliament in 2012, while he was still a nominated member of the Rajya Sabha. ""Till my last breath I will be thankful to him (Arun Jaitley). The Bill was introduced by the UPA but he heard everything and read everything and he said 'it is a gentleman's promise that I will see to it that the Bill is passed because it is right',"" Akhtar recalled. Meanwhile, during the course of the book launch event on Thursday, Akthar asked about what he thought about current productions in the Indian film industry said that ""content is a part of the larger society."" ""Indian film industry or Indian films and their content is a part of the larger society. It is not that movies are portraying something that is not happening in our society. Indian films have always reflected what is happening in the society. Even commercial films are realistic,"" said Akhtar. The veteran poet, however, painted a gloomy picture on how language itself had shrunk in society. ""You do not have that level of vocabulary that your grandparents had,"" he told the gathering. ""For the pursuit of creating wealth, we have left behind our culture, tradition, mythology, language, and literature.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/artificial-intelligence-in-its-current-form-not-threat-to-creativity-javed-akhtar/articleshow/103881742.cms
2023-09-21,Hangzhou Asian Games: Where culture and history blend with world-beating technology,Jaspreet Sahni,"HANGZHOU: 'Smart'. That's what one comes across as a unanimous first impression at the 19th Asian Games , but it's not a surprise when you are at what's regarded as the Artificial Intelligence (AI) headquarters - Hangzhou . And, therefore, not a surprise to witness China promoting the 19th edition of the Asiad as the 'Smart' Games. Hangzhou, in fact, brings together a unique blend of historical landscapes like the West Lake, which has inspired poets as long back as the 9th century, to being a world leader in technology. Hangzhou's role in the ancient Silk Road is a major part of its rich cultural heritage, which led to development of civilization that has gone to add that 'silken' touch to its seamless technology-driven living in the modern era, and it is also driving the Games. From the bottom to the top level, the Games paint a picture that at times almost resembles a 'Technology Fair' - at least until the on-field competition completely takes over after the opening ceremony on September 23. A walk through the Main Media Centre ( MMC ) can leave even the digital freaks overwhelmed. It's literally a 'Cloud' of technology and activity that mesmerizes you. A robot can answer all your banking queries at the Main Media Centre, another one can be seen exhibiting its ability to transfer small goods from one point to another. If you are in the way, it will gently ask, 'please be careful.' You can walk into the AI-generated image kiosk to punch keywords of your choice and ask the system to throw up related images that you can then cast on the giant digital curve, or take a walkthrough to learn how AI can revolutionize the broadcast world. Enter the MMC and a giant screen beaming a 'Cloud' of activity across the Games welcomes the accredited media. At the venues, if you are unable to locate your seat, the 'Smart Hangzhou 2022' application will do it for you. The Tonglu Equestrian Centre , intriguingly, has been provided a 'digital twin'. It replicates the arena and uses technology to digitally keep an eye on all the aspects, including energy conservation. Language barriers seem a thing of the past when volunteers not fluent in English push a button on their cell phone and gently extend the device closer to a foreign guest to record his query. The AI-enabled application translates that in Mandarin for the volunteers, who then are ready to guide. ""Regarding intelligent spectator experiences, we have created the first-ever digital spectator service platform called 'Smart Hangzhou 2022,' and introduced Asian Games AR services,"" said Chen Weiqiang , executive secretary-general of the Organizing Committee of the Games , at a press conference. But that's not where it ends. The Games have also incorporated: 1. 5G-Advanced: Can transfer data up to 10 times the speed of standard 5G 2. Passive IoT (Internet of things): Can monitor environmental temperatures and humidity, tracking of logistics vehicles, warehouse management, asset inventory management and can prevent theft by monitoring valuable assets deployed at the Games venues 3. Driverless buses: Uses autonomous driving technology (in service at the co-host city of Deqing, between the Sports Center Gymnasium and the Geographic Information Town Basketball Court ) Not far in the future, the 'China Artificial Intelligence Town' in Hangzhou will stand to testify the city's leading presence on the world technology map. But for the moment, it's the turn of Asian Games to provide a digital sports experience like never before.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/hangzhou-asian-games-where-culture-and-history-blend-with-world-beating-technology/articleshow/103840405.cms

2023-09-19,Will AI kill the subtitle writer?,Shruti Sonal,"With more people reading captions rather than listening to content, subtitles are big business. Now, AI looms over this job This reflects in the global captioning and subtitles market. In 2021, it was just under $300 million, according to the data tracker Valuates Reports, and is expected to touch nearly $500 million by 2028. With so much demand, not only is there a surge in the number of subtitle writers and agencies supplying these services in the country, but also a new factor in the mix: AI. Dubverse.ai is a Gurugram-based startup which uses generative AI to help users dub and subtitle their videos into over 90 languages, Indian and otherwise. While the startup was born to cater to edtech clients during the pandemic, today its clients include individual content creators, media houses, and streaming platforms. Co-founder Anuja Dhawan says the main advantage is cost. “While dubbing is an old industry, it was very restricted to high-value clients such as filmmakers. The costs for dubbing are as high as Rs 2,000 per minute. However, with AI, we’ve been able to bring down the cost massively to as low as Rs 50 per minute,” says Dhawan. Since its launch, 5,00,000 users have signed up on the platform, Dhawan claims, adding that nearly 30% of them are from outside India. It is also in the process of demoing its products to production houses such as Sony. In order to cut costs, production houses and streaming platforms are also turning to the use of artificial intelligence . Eros Now, for instance, tied up with Google Cloud to use AI technology for streaming its entire range of movies and originals with automated subtitles. Rohit Shivdasani, co-founder of post-production services provider Atom Ant Studios which pivoted to subtitling in the pandemic, says the sheer volume of demand for subtitles makes the use of AI inevitable. “The demand is coming not only from new content, but the hundreds of shows and films that are being acquired by streaming platforms and added to their library,” says Shivdasani. “For live broadcasting, the subtitles need to be churned out in multiple languages on the same day. It’s just not possible for humans to do it.” Another player is Mumbai-based startup Banva — named after the Marathi word for creating. It not only provides AI-based subtitle generation services, but also a tool that allows users to edit the generated subtitles quickly. About 2,000 people have already signed up, its founder Rahul Pawar says. “While writing AI-generated subtitles for the field of entertainment is tricky due to local nuances, sarcasm and idioms, clients are realising that a software like this can lead to much faster turnaround times and reduce the manual workload by almost 80%,” he says. Banva’s pricing today costs Rs 500 for generating subtitles for a one-hour long video, and a credit-based system for longer duration needs. Dubverse, on the other hand, has monthly subscriptions starting from Rs 3,000. In contrast, the average rates charged by a manual subtitle writer range from Rs 80-100 per minute. Despite the promise that the world of subtitling holds for AI-based firms, there are considerable challenges in understanding, translating, and subtitling the vast pool of Indian languages. Obstacles include the gendered nature of objects, which is absent in English, as well as accents and cultural contexts. Pawar says the platform is trying to negotiate these hurdles. “A lot of content in India is multilingual. Different characters are speaking in Hindi, English, Marathi, and so on. To handle that, we are training our models to better handle multilingual speech.” Yet, the accuracy levels differ for different language pairings, he admits. For instance, while English subtitles generated for Hindi content are nearly 90% accurate, the accuracy is lower for other languages. For subtitles from one regional language to another, the road to success is longer. The question plaguing the subtitling and dubbing industry is the same one that is at the centre of the writers’ strike in Hollywood: Will AI kill human workers in the industry? Veteran subtitle writers like Vivek Ranjit are confident that writing good subtitles is an art and cannot be replaced by technology. “We can’t predict how far AI tech will progress, but I believe that we will always need a human touch, especially in a country like India where we have so many different cultures. Things keep changing from state to state and we have songs with expressions that cannot be literally translated,” says Ranjit, who has written subtitles for over 220 films. AI players, on the other hand, say the tech was neither meant to open the doors to a battle between writers and computers nor was it meant to have 100% accuracy. Banva’s Pawar says, “We are not trying to take away jobs from subtitlers. We are just trying to make their jobs easier.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/will-ai-kill-the-subtitle-writer/articleshow/103747245.cms

Beijing Fourth Paradigm, an AI startup, is aiming to raise up to $144 million by selling 18.4 million shares in a price range of HK$55.60 to HK$61.16 each, according to its regulatory filings. Three cornerstone investors, headed by New China Capital Management, have subscribed for about $96.8 million worth of stock, which equates to 70.6% of the IPO, the filings showed. Fourth Paradigm was added to the US ""Entity List"" this year, which means US suppliers are barred from shipping US technology to it unless they can procure a difficult-to-obtain licence from the Commerce Department. Founded in September 2014, Fourth Paradigm's products have been used in finance, retail, manufacturing, healthcare, energy and power, telecommunications, healthcare and other sectors, according to its website. Separately, Chinese cloud hospital platform Neusoft Xikang is aiming to raise $81 million to $101 million by selling 133.8 million shares, regulatory filings showed. The stock is being sold in a price range of HK$4.76 to HK$5.91 each. ZX Inc , the mobile games operator, is selling 18.97 million shares in a range between HK$11 to HK$14 each to raise between $27 million and $34 million, according to its prospectus.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinese-ai-firm-fourth-paradigm-leads-hong-kong-ipo-surge-to-raise-280-million/articleshow/103748085.cms
2023-09-18,Netanyahu visits Elon Musk in California with plans to talk about artificial intelligence,AP,"SAN JOSE: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is starting a US trip in California to talk about technology and artificial intelligence with billionaire businessman Elon Musk . The Israeli leader posted Monday on Musk's social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, that he plans to talk with the Tesla CEO ""about how we can harness the opportunities and mitigate the risks of AI for the good of civilization."" Netanyahu's high-profile visit to the San Francisco Bay Area comes at a time when Musk is facing accusations of tolerating antisemitic messages on his social media platform, while Netanyahu is confronting political opposition at home and abroad. Protesters gathered early Monday outside the Fremont, California factory where Tesla makes its cars. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis have taken part in nine months of demonstrations against Netanyahu's plan to overhaul Israel's judicial system. Those protests have spread overseas, with groups of Israeli expats staging demonstrations during visits by Netanyahu and other members of his Cabinet. Meanwhile, the Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish civil-rights organization, has accused Musk of allowing antisemitism and hate speech to spread on X, in part by amplifying the messages of neo-Nazis and white supremacists who want to ban the league by engaging with them on the platform. In a Sept. 4 post, Musk claimed that the league was ""trying to kill this platform by falsely accusing it & me of being anti-Semitic."" In other posts, he said the league was responsible for a 60% drop in revenue at X. The group met this month with X's chief executive, Linda Yaccarino. Both Musk and Yaccarino have recently posted messages saying they oppose antisemitism. From California, Netanyahu heads to New York, where he is scheduled to address the United Nations General Assembly and meet with President Joe Biden and other world leaders, his office said. They include German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Netanyahu says the judicial overhaul plan is needed to curb the powers of unelected judges, whom he and his allies say are liberal and overly interventionist. Critics say his plan is a power grab that will destroy the country's system of checks and balances and push it toward autocratic rule. Leading figures in Israel's influential high-tech community have played a prominent role in the protests. They say weakening the judiciary will hurt the country's business climate and drive away foreign investment. Israel's currency, the shekel, has plunged in value this year in a sign of weakening foreign investment.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/netanyahu-visits-elon-musk-in-california-with-plans-to-talk-about-artificial-intelligence/articleshow/103764985.cms
2023-09-13,Apple and the curious case of 'skipping' the hottest buzzword in tech,Aabhas Sharma,"Trust Apple to not follow the herd. The iPhone launch event is arguably the most watched tech event of the year. Millions tune in to see what Apple has up its sleeve and that’s a readymade audience that follows every word the folks from Cupertino utter. Yet, in the 87-minute keynote, Apple didn’t mention AI or artificial intelligence even once. Compare it with other tech giants. Microsoft can’t stop talking about it. Google doesn’t miss a beat to mention it either. Meta gets in overdrive mode talking about AI. Even Amazon drops it wherever it can. It’s not as if Apple is averse to AI or not using it. In fact, artificial intelligence powers some of the coolest features that Apple showed in its devices. And that has been the case for many years now. Apple’s ‘aversion' to talk about AI Apple likes to use the term machine learning more than artificial intelligence. At WWDC 2023, Apple CEO Tim Cook and other executives didn’t mention AI even once during the event. Apple’s approach to AI is more about how it works in the background. If at all, the company has to tout an AI-powered feature, it uses machine learning rather than AI. The other reason is that other tech companies have made a massive pivot towards AI. Microsoft in Edge browser, Bing Search, Windows 11, and so on. Google in Gmail, Docs, and Search is becoming more AI-oriented. Apple hasn't and still remains more of a hardware company. More than 40% of its revenue still comes from the iPhone. Back in May, Cook said, “We view AI as huge and we’ll continue weaving it in our products on a very thoughtful basis.” Apple is making Siri smarter on the Watch Series 9 and Ultra and it’s nothing but AI. Apple still avoids mentioning it and prefers to talk about its machine-learning capabilities. Apple is letting the AI do all the cool things in its hardware and software. However, it just doesn’t want to talk about it in the same way as others. It could be a deliberate move as all association with AI isn’t seen as positive. There’s a sense of skepticism around it or even there might be an element of fear. Why evoke that when you can avoid seems to be Apple’s mantra.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/apple-and-the-curious-case-of-skipping-the-hottest-buzzword-in-tech/articleshow/103620612.cms
2023-09-13,California firefighters use artificial intelligence to battle wildfires,AFP,"SAN DIEGO: When a wildfire erupted in the middle of a recent California night, it could have been a disaster. But thanks to a new monitoring system that uses artificial intelligence to scan for danger, firefighters were able to quell the blaze long before it got out of hand. ""It was less than a quarter acre,"" Captain Kris Yeary of Cal Fire told AFP. ""Had the AI not alerted us to it, it could have gotten much bigger."" Yeary, who is responsible for organizing firefighting over an area that includes Mount Laguna, around 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of San Diego, sprang into action around 3am on August 5 after a call from colleagues at a command center. Computers watching live feeds from the Cleveland National Forest spotted what their algorithm had been taught to understand was a column of smoke. Human operators were able to verify the machines were correct and alerted Yeary, whose firefighters quickly extinguished the flames. ""It could have been a devastating fire,"" he said. Artificial intelligence is a rapidly developing field of computing that seeks to mimic human abilities to ""think."" Unlike a traditional computer, which can only produce answers based on the concrete information it has, AI can infer answers, using experience it has gained from similar problems it has seen before -- similar to a human being. Over the last few years, its application has spread to include areas as diverse as weather forecasting, stock-picking, art and journalism. That has brought with it worries from people who fear it will do them out of their jobs -- the writers' and actors' strike currently paralyzing Hollywood is in part about the use of AI in films and television. But firefighters battling California's wildfires say they will take all the help they can get. ""AI is just another tool for us,"" said Yeary. ""It's never going to replace firefighters."" California experiences thousands of fires every year, which torch hundreds of thousands -- sometimes millions -- of acres (hectares). Over the last decade, blazes have claimed more than 200 lives, and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses, wreaking billions of dollars of damage. For several years firefighters have used a network of more than 1,000 cameras to monitor possible fire hotspots. Since the end of June, the ALERTCalifornia system has had AI computers ""watching"" these feeds, and flagging to human operators when they see wisps of smoke that could be a fire -- with promising results. ""Our success metric is the fires you never hear about,"" says Neal Driscoll, who heads the project for the University of California San Diego. ""We beat 911 calls about 40 percent of the time. And it's going to get better."" The addition of AI has meant each firefighter watching the dozens of feeds they are responsible for now has a helping hand. When the software believes it detects smoke, it displays a small red rectangle on the screen, and offers a percentage indicating its degree of certainty. It is then up to the operator to confirm the seriousness of the alert -- and weed out any confusion. Currently, the system can erroneously flag dust raised by tractors, insects in front of the camera or even a bit of fog. ""When a cloud will go over... it can cast a shadow on the ground and sometimes (the computer) can actually think that that's possibly smoke,"" says Suzann Leininger, an intelligence specialist at Cal Fire. The feedback that experts like Leininger give -- no, that's just a bit of weather -- is helping the AI to get better at what it does. But even in its current state, it's a boon. ""It's getting us time to react in a faster manner,"" says Leininger. And when you're talking about fire, time can be everything. As California grapples with the effects of human-caused climate change, fires are becoming bigger and more destructive. The state has experienced 18 of its 20 largest wildfires on record in the last two decades. With terrifying blazes ripping through Europe, Canada and Hawaii this year, the devastating impact of the changing climate is becoming ever-more apparent worldwide. ""I think that as we see these devastations in other areas, like in Greece, and Maui, that systems like this that provide early confirmation will be a step in the right direction,"" says Driscoll of UC San Diego. Faced with the scale of the threat, the scientist has chosen to grant public access to the data on his platform, so that other companies or academics can work on it. ""We need to leverage all of our assets and work together, because extreme climate is bigger than any one of us.""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-firefighters-use-artificial-intelligence-to-battle-wildfires/articleshow/103620767.cms
2023-09-13,"Solutions to health, climate problems need to be low-cost: Bill Gates",Surojit Gupta,"The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation released its flagship Goalkeepers Report on Tuesday which says simple innovations could save 2 million more mothers and babies. Bill Gates says all the seven innovations mentioned in the report would be available in India at very low cost soon, and innovation across sectors will help overcome the lack of funding. Excerpts from a video interview with TOI’s Surojit Gupta: In recent days, there has been some anxiety about new strains of Covid in the US and other places. Is there a threat? We always have a risk there. It’s not likely that there’ll be a variant of Covid that’ll go back to causing the level of death like it did at the beginning. I see a lot of good product work on diagnostics and vaccines. We are now working with partners to make mRNA factories very easy to build at low cost. When I’m in Senegal in October at the Foundation’s Grand Challenges events, we’ll announce with our partners the progress on making mRNA vaccine manufacturing highly accessible all over the world. We’re also doing stuff on low-cost diagnostics, and we’re trying to convince countries to scale up sewage surveillance. But I’ve looked at the data on the latest variants, and there’s nothing alarming there. The variants continue to change, but there’s nothing that’s more disease causing than what we’ve seen in the past. In terms of surveillance, what is your experience with countries? Well, on Covid specifically, because the death rates are down to sort of a seasonal flu level, most countries are doing very little, and most people are doing very little. That is, how often do people get tested? Not very often. The disease is now being treated as an endemic. When the fatality rate drops to this level, society just goes about their business like they do with flu. In the Goalkeepers Report, you point to some important issues of preventing maternal mortality and bringing down the rates of child mortality. Could you elaborate on these solutions? India continues to make good progress on reducing maternal deaths and childhood deaths, but there’s still a lot to be done. What’s interesting is, these seven interventions are not vaccines. These are all about helping the mother and the child, particularly in the first 30 days, where the first day of life is the most risky. A lot of these things relate to nutrition, changing the vitamins a mother takes from just iodine and folic acid to the other nutrients. We’re working to figure out exactly what the right mix of the multiple micronutrient supplements would be for India. We now have this IV iron, which actually is an improved approach in India. But the big breakthrough here is that, instead of having to come in six times to get your own treatment, there’s a formulation that lets you come in once. Right now, that’s fairly expensive, about $50. We’re working with partners in India. We think we can get that down to more like $15 or maybe even $10, and you just get it once during the pregnancy. Our partners are also coming up with a very low-cost anaemia test, haemoglobin test. And if you’re significantly deficient, then you would have this intravenous one-time treatment. There’s a lot of good collaboration on that in India. Our belief is that all seven of these will be applicable in India and that they’ll be very low cost. They’ll contribute to reducing mother and child mortality. In the rest of the world, our progress is somewhat stalled because of the pandemic, and we’re having to get things back on track. But in India, things have continued to get better. We expect a lot of these tools, like the B. infantis (a type of good gut bacteria), to be developed and tested in partnership with the government of India. And then, based on that experience, we’ll go and scale it up in other places, including Africa. You also referred to artificial intelligence being used in these interventions and in the health sector. There have been calls for having some sort of regulation. So, how do you see this conflict between regulation and beneficial use? When AI is used in a very narrow, well-defined way, the metric is whatever the regulatory metric was already in place. Here in the ultrasound we’re looking at the pregnancy, and determining how old the neonate is. And if it’s a risky delivery, we say, make sure to get the woman to a place where they can have good medical care, including being able to do a C-section. Where the AI has been trained by looking at tens of thousands of normal deliveries and tens of thousands of abnormal deliveries, that information can come early. That’s kind of a novel tool. We’re having to talk to the regulators about what would approval look like. But because ultrasound is getting very cheap, and the hardware to run this software on is very cheap, the cost per scan would be less than a dollar because you’ll be using the tool again and again. If you go more broadly to where you’re using AI, like to get medical advice, that will present novel issues. AI’s not good enough yet, at least I haven’t seen anyone’s AI that’s good enough yet to be a substitute. It looks like we can improve the doctor’s job and make them more productive, quite substantially, using AI. But health is going to be the area where people will want to really double-check that you’ve avoided mistakes. AI is incredibly brilliant sometimes, and it’s incredibly stupid sometimes. In terms of funding the challenges that the world faces for health, education, climate change , do you see lack of funding affecting progress? Should the private sector have a bigger role? There’s a huge shortage of funding. Fortunately, India, through its own tax collection, funds the health system. It’s great to see that it’s getting a higher priority over time. But in African countries, the health system is quite dependent on development aid for the funding of things like HIV medicines. We have all these demands. We have the ongoing development demands, we have climate mitigation demands to change the energy system. We have climate adaptation demands to help countries change to deal with the new weather. We have loss and damages, and we have the war in Ukraine with the many refugee costs and economic costs. There’s a gigantic shortage of money, particularly at a time where interest rates are high and some of the developing countries are very indebted. Yes, there are very tough trade-offs involved here. The main solution to that is going to be innovation. Whether it’s innovation for climate mitigation to make the cost of going green lower, or whatever new health things we have, they need to be very low-cost. We’re very proud of our record of reducing vaccine prices, partly with partnerships with companies like Serum (Institute of India). We’ve got the price down for things like pneumococcus (vaccine) enough to allow us to add other vaccines. But the money shortage is incredible. In fact, you’ll see at these climate conferences, everybody saying, hey, where’s the money? And the fact is that even the rich countries have budget challenges. Taking money away from development would be a huge mistake because that’s hugely impactful. In this context, how do you see the call for reform of the multilateral agencies, such as the World Bank and the IMF, to expand their lending to these sectors? The World Bank plays a very important role, and a lot of money for health systems comes from the World Bank. You can probably stretch the balance sheet and get some additional money out of the World Bank, but there’s a limit to that. Sometimes countries are not able to pay back their debts. We do want the World Bank to maintain a strong credit rating so it can borrow. The World Bank actually did quite a bit more during the pandemic and they spent money. And so, part of our challenge now is that they spent some money ahead, IDA money, during the pandemic. We’ll get some additional money there, but it won’t solve the money shortage problem. It’ll be like a 30% increase, which is worthwhile, but the activists are still going to say, hey, we want more money. What about the private sector? If you innovate so that the cost of green products or health products is very, very low, then of course, you want to use the private sector. The private sector is going to build big solar fields and battery storage. People like Reliance, if they see an opportunity, if they can do it economically, yes, they’ll step up and do these complex projects. For climate mitigation in particular, we need to attract the private sector. But the government creates the regulatory environment, and they have to manage the grid and all of that. For things like health and climate adaptation, particularly for the poorest, you still need government tax money in order to achieve that. Some diseases, like visceral leishmaniasis (kala azar), there’s no private sector there. That’s philanthropists like us working with the Indian government to achieve aggressive goals. You have been a great fan of India’s digital public infrastructure . Do you think that can be replicated in other parts of the world voluntarily as there seems to be a reluctance on the part of the developed world to create a fund to take these experiments to the rest of the world? We are taking all the lessons from India about the Aadhaar ID system and the financial capabilities so that women can save. It’s a really great system, and we feel proud that it’s not only beneficial to India, but will help the entire world. There is an open ID platform called MOSIP that’s developed in India, and now it is getting adopted by a number of other countries. I think there are, like, a dozen countries now, and we want to spread that more. I’m constantly telling countries, like I was talking to Kenya about, hey, don’t buy that commercial solution that’s not nearly as good. This open source thing that’s based on Aadhaar is the right solution.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/in-health-sector-people-will-want-to-double-check-to-avoid-errors-bill-gates/articleshow/103617128.cms
2023-09-12,Nvidia's dominance in AI chips deters funding for startups,Reuters,"Nvidia 's supremacy in building computer chips for artificial intelligence has chilled venture funding for would-be rivals, investors said, with the number of US deals this quarter falling 80% from a year ago. The Santa Clara, California company dominates the market for chips that work with massive amounts of language data. Generative AI models get incrementally smarter through exposure to more data, a process called training. As Nvidia has grown stronger in this area, the harder it has become for companies attempting to build competing chips. Seeing these startups as a riskier bet, venture financiers are newly unwilling to provide big cash infusions. Advancing a chip design to a working prototype can cost more than $500 million, so the pullback has quickly threatened the startups' prospects. ""Nvidia's continued dominance has put a really fine point on how hard it is to break into this market,"" said Greg Reichow, a partner at Eclipse Ventures. ""This has resulted in a pullback in investment into these companies, or at least into many of them."" US chip startups have raised $881.4 million through the end of August, according to PitchBook data. That compares to $1.79 billion for the first three quarters of 2022. The number of deals has dropped from 23 to four through the end of August. Nvidia declined to comment. AI chip startup Mythic, which has raised about $160 million in total, ran out of cash last year and was nearly forced to halt operations, technology website The Register reported. But it managed to bring in a relatively modest $13 million investment several months later in March. Nvidia has ""indirectly"" contributed to overall AI chip fundraising woes, because investors want ""Home run only type investments with a huge investment, huge return,"" Mythic CEO Dave Rick said. Difficult economic conditions have added to the downturn in the cyclical semiconductor industry, Rick said. A secretive startup called Rivos, which is working on chip designs for data servers has had trouble raising funding recently, said two sources familiar with the company's situation. A Rivos spokesperson said Nvidia's market dominance hasn't hindered its fundraising efforts and its hardware and software ""continues to excite our investors."" Rivos is embroiled in litigation with Apple , which has accused Rivos of stealing intellectual property, and this has compounded the fundraising challenge. Demanding investors Chip startups looking to raise cash are facing tougher demands from investors. They require companies to have a product that is within months of launch or already generating sales, sources said. About two years ago, new investments in chip startups were often $200 million or $300 million. That has fallen to about $100 million, according to PitchBook analyst Brendan Burke. At least two AI chip startups have overcome investor reluctance by trumpeting potential customers or their relationships with well-known executives. To raise $100 million in August, Tenstorrent boasted about CEO Jim Keller, a near legendary chip architect who has designed chips for Apple, Advanced Micro Devices and Tesla. D-Matrix, which has projected revenue of less than $10 million this year, raised $110 million last week, bolstered by financial backing from Microsoft and a commitment by the Windows maker to test d-Matrix's new AI chip after it launches next year. While these chip makers in Nvidia's shadow struggle, startups in AI software and related technologies do not face the same constraints. They brought in about $24 billion in funding this year through August, according to PitchBook data. Despite Nvidia's dominance in AI computing, the company does not have an unassailable lock on the sector. AMD plans to launch this year a chip that will compete with Nvidia's, and Intel leapfrogged development by gaining a rival product in an acquisition. Sources see these as having long-term potential to become alternatives to Nvidia's chip. There are also adjacent applications that could provide openings for competitors. For example, chips that perform data-intensive computing for prediction algorithms are an emerging niche. Nvidia does not dominate this area and it's ripe for investment.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidias-dominance-in-ai-chips-deters-funding-for-startups/articleshow/103587851.cms

2023-09-11,"G20 leaders bat for 'responsible artificial intelligence', eye ethics-based regulation",Agencies,"NEW DELHI: Amid the rise of generative artificial intelligence , leaders from G20 countries discussed how to harness the technology to benefit development, while ensuring that safeguards are built in to check misuse. Citing the example of AI, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pointed to the massive scale and speed of new generation technology and highlighted the need to go beyond the ""Principles on AI"" adopted in 2019. ""I suggest we establish a framework for responsible human-centric AI governance. India will also give its suggestions. It will be our effort that all countries get the benefits of AI in areas like socio-economic development, global workforce, and research and development,"" he said. Ahead of the summit, Modi had flagged the importance of using AI in an ethical manner. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen suggested an oversight body similar to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, with German finance minister Christian Lindner underlining the need to address the issue of ethics. A government official said that during the deliberations one of the leaders wondered if AI ""replaced or enhanced human skills"" and suggested that it should be used in an ethical manner. Another called for facilitating beneficial aspects of the technology, while cautioning against the related risks associated with it. Reflecting the discussions on the issue, the New Delhi Declaration, released on Saturday had said that G20 would work to ensure "" responsible AI development, deployment and use."" They also agreed to pursue a ""pro-innovation regulatory/governance approach"" that maximises the benefits of AI but takes into account the risks associated with it. In recent months, regulating AI has become a major issue for discussion among policymakers. Leaders from G7, the advanced countries group, have agreed on the need for governance, pointing to the risks that the technology poses. They have launched what is called ""Hiroshima Process"" to discuss the issue and present the results by the end of the year.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/g20-leaders-bat-for-responsible-artificial-intelligence-eye-ethics-based-regulation/articleshow/103560393.cms
2023-09-11,artificial intelligence detects gallbladder cancer as accurately as radiologists in India: Lancet study,PTI,"NEW DELHI: An artificial intelligence (AI) based approach demonstrated diagnostic performance comparable to experienced radiologists in detecting gall bladder cancer at a hospital in Chandigarh, according to a study published in The Lancet Regional Health – Southeast Asia journal. Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with a poor detection and a high mortality rate. Early diagnosis is challenging because benign gallbladder lesions can have similar imaging features, the researchers said. The team at Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) in Chandigarh and Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), New Delhi, aimed to develop and validate a deep learning (DL) model for GBC detection using abdominal ultrasound and compare its performance with radiologists. Deep learning is a method in AI that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain. The study used abdominal ultrasound data from patients with gallbladder lesions acquired between August 2019 and June 2021 at PGIMER, a tertiary care hospital. A deep learning (DL) model was trained on a dataset of 233 patients, validated on 59 patients, and tested on 273 patients. The DL model's performance was evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), which is widely used to measure the accuracy of diagnostic tests. Two radiologists also independently reviewed the ultrasound images, and their diagnostic performance was compared to the DL model. In the test set, the DL model had a sensitivity of 92.3 per cent, specificity of 74.4 per cent, and an AUC of 0.887 for detecting GBC, which was comparable to both radiologists, according to the study. The DL-based approach showed high sensitivity and AUC for detecting GBC in the presence of stones, contracted gallbladders, small lesion size (less than 10 mm), and neck lesions, which were also comparable to the radiologists, the researchers said. The DL model exhibited higher sensitivity for detecting the mural thickening type of GBC compared to one of the radiologists, despite a reduced specificity, they said. ""The DL-based approach demonstrated diagnostic performance comparable to experienced radiologists in detecting GBC using ultrasound,"" the authors of the study noted. ""Further multicentre studies are recommended to fully explore the potential of DL-based GBC diagnosis,"" they added. The authors acknowledged some limitations of the study. The findings are based on a single-centre dataset, and multicentre studies are needed for broader validation. The study has a knowledge cutoff date in 2021, and subsequent developments in DL and GBC diagnosis may not be reflected, they added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/artificial-intelligence-detects-gallbladder-cancer-as-accurately-as-radiologists-in-india-lancet-study/articleshow/103571914.cms
2023-09-11,Jaipur police harness AI facial recognition to enhance security,TNN,"Jaipur: The city police have adopted Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to monitor potential miscreants moving within the city using the Facial Recognition System (FRC). Kunwar Rasthradeep, the Additional Commissioner of Police (Law and Order), explained that the FRC-equipped CCTVs enable law enforcement to identify individuals with previous criminal records in crowded areas. He cited an example from Janmashtami, where 13 suspects attempting to enter the Govind Dev Ji temple were identified using AI technology. Rasthradeep further said that following the successful implementation at the Govind Dev Ji Temple, the police plan to trial this technology at the Ganesh temple during Ganesh Chaturthi. After evaluating its effectiveness, a proposal for the purchase of these cameras will be considered, providing the police with a valuable tool for apprehending offenders. The official said that a facial recognition system is an advanced AI technology that identifies and verifies individuals by retrieving a database. These faceprints are then compared against a database of known faces to identify or verify the person's identity. The police said that they have a database of the suspects and the AI will scan the database after plucking up images from the CCTV to identify if the suspect is the same person. Police officials hope that the same technology, if used in the city, can be used to identify and arrest fleeing criminals and recover abducted persons from the clutches of their captors.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/jaipur-police-harness-ai-facial-recognition-to-enhance-security/articleshow/103564720.cms
2023-09-11,Google looks to make artificial intelligence as simple as Search,Ardhra Nair,"SAN FRANCISCO: Google is now doing to AI what it did to the internet. ""We are taking the sophistication of the AI model and putting it behind a simple interface called chat which then lets you open it up to every department,"" Google Cloud's CEO Thomas Kurian said. Duet AI in Workspace and Vertex AI - both recently launched products by Google - are expected to revolutionise the market, he added. Kurian was speaking with some members of the press last week on the sidelines of the three-day Google Cloud Next - a mega event at Moscone Center in San Francisco from August 29. ""AI can be used in virtually every department, every business function in a company, and every industry. Retailers are testing it for shopping and commerce. Telecommunication companies are using it for customer service. Banks are using it to synthesise financial statements for their wealth managers. We expect the number of people who can use AI to grow just like when we simplified access to the internet and broadened it,"" he added. Vertex AI Search and Conversation, which was made available during the Cloud Next event, allows developers with minimum machine learning knowledge to take data, customise it, build an interactive chatbot or search engine within it, and deploy the apps within a few hours. Aparna Pappu, VP and general manager of Google Workspace, said Duet AI has your back. ""It can help write emails and make presentations using different sources and summarise what was said in a virtual meeting and even attend the meet on the user's behalf,"" she said in another media interaction during the event. Kurian said that generative AI is moving technology out of the IT department to many other functions in companies. ""When we look at users of generative AI - marketing departments, HR, supply chain organisations - none of them were talking to us earlier, but at this conference, many are from non-engineering backgrounds... from different business lines because they want to understand how they can use generative AI technology,"" he added. Google has provided an AI platform that protects data and ensures that it does not leak out. ""We have capability in Vertex so data can be kept and any feedback or changes to the model are private to you,"" he added. Kurian said they have analysed a million users, understood their behaviour, and found that an average user of Duet can typically write 30-40% more emails with more than 50% of the content generated by the model.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/google-looks-to-make-artificial-intelligence-as-simple-as-search/articleshow/103560147.cms
2023-09-10,artificial intelligence a guzzler as Microsoft's water use rises 34%,AP,"DES MOINES: The cost of building an artificial intelligence product like ChatGPT can be hard to measure. But one thing Microsoft-backed OpenAI needed for its technology was plenty of water, pulled from the watershed of the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers in central Iowa to cool a powerful supercomputer as it helped teach its AI systems how to mimic human writing. Leading tech developers including Microsoft , OpenAI and Google have acknowledged that growing demand for their AI tools carries hefty costs, from expensive semiconductors to an increase in water consumption. But they're often secretive about the specifics. Few people in Iowa knew about its status as a birthplace of OpenAI's large language model GPT-4, before a Microsoft executive said it ""was literally made next to cornfields of Des Moines."" Building a large language model requires analyzing patterns across a huge trove of human-written text. All of that computing takes a lot of electricity and generates a lot of heat. To keep it cool on hot days, data centres need to pump in water - often to a cooling tower outside its warehouse-sized buildings. In its latest environmental report, Microsoft disclosed that its global water consumption spiked 34% from 2021 to 2022 (to nearly 1.7 billion gallons, or more than 2,500 Olympic-sized swimming pools), a sharp increase compared to previous years that outside researchers tie to its AI research. ""It's fair to say the majority of the growth is due to AI,"" including ""its heavy investment in generative AI and partnership with OpenAI,"" said Shaolei Ren, a researcher at the University of California, Riverside who has been trying to calculate the environmental impact of generative AI . In a paper to be published later this year, Ren's team estimates ChatGPT gulps up 500 millilitres of water every time you ask it a series of between 5 to 50 prompts or questions. The range varies depending on where its servers are located and the season. The estimate includes indirect water usage that the firms don't measure - such as to cool power plants that supply the datacentres with electricity.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/artificial-intelligence-a-guzzler-as-microsofts-water-use-rises-34/articleshow/103541432.cms

Speaking at the Global K-12 summit held in the city, he said: “Two-third of India’s internet users are in the age group of 12- 29 years. Over 70% in this age group resides in rural areas. Given this power of technology, I urge schools to focus on how it can be integrated with education that’ll develop skills among students, needed for 21st century.” Tripathi also highlighted the need for integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education — both for educators and learners. He explained how AI can provide a more equitable education by aiding students with special needs, such as visually impaired learners, through features like reading assistance. Additionally, AI-powered interactive educational games can teach academic skills while assisting administrators with data analysis, informed decision-making, efficient scheduling, transportation, IT, maintenance, and budgeting. When asked about the rise in cost of education, especially with the flurry of private equity investment in K-12 segment, he admitted to education being “extensively commercialised”. “Quality education does not come in charity. Many schools have scholarships and grants that students from modest backgrounds can avail. But,we must understand that education is not a social service,” he added. The summit brought together representatives from 190 schools to engage in discussions around the evolving role of technology in education, with a focus on global standards for enhancing learning experience through advanced technology.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/global-k-12-summit-ed-tech-to-become-12-billion-industry-by-2025-say-experts/articleshow/103523459.cms
2023-09-08,China may be behind online accounts seeking to sway US voters: Microsoft,Reuters,"Microsoft researchers said on Thursday they found what they believe is a network of fake, Chinese-controlled social media accounts seeking to influence US voters by using artificial intelligence . A Chinese embassy spokesperson in Washington said that accusations of China using AI to create fake social media accounts were “full of prejudice and malicious speculation” and that China advocates for the safe use of AI. In a new research report, Microsoft said the social media accounts were part of a suspected Chinese information operation. The campaign bore similarities to activity which the US department of justice has attributed to “an elite group within (China’s) ministry of public security,” Microsoft said. The researchers did not specify which social media platforms were affected, but screenshots in their report showed posts from what appeared to be Facebook and Twitter, now known as X. The report highlights a fraught social media environment as Americans prepare for the 2024 presidential election. The US government has accused Russia of meddling in the 2016 election with a covert social media campaign and has warned of subsequent efforts by China, Russia and Iran to influence voters. The report did not explain in detail how researchers attributed the posts to China. A Microsoft spokesperson said the company’s rese archer used a “multifaceted attribution model”, which relies on “technical evidence, behavioral evidence and contextual evidence”. “The campaign began using generative AI in about March 2023 to create politically charged content in English and “mimic US voters,” Microsoft said. The new content is more “eye-catching than the awkward visuals in previous campaigns by Chinese nationstate actors, which relied on digital drawings, stock photo collages, and manual graphic designs,” researchers wrote. The spokesperson said the identified accounts had attempted to appear American by listing their public location as within US, posting political slogans, and sharing hashtags relating to domestic political issues.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/china-may-be-behind-online-a/cs-seeking-to-sway-us-voters-ms/articleshow/103485340.cms

2023-09-05,Sebi working on AI tool to curb misselling by mutual funds: Buch,PTI,"MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi is building an artificial intelligence tool to help detect misselling by mutual funds , its Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch said on Tuesday. She cited a recent incident of a 90-year-old being sold a product with a seven-year lock-in period to illustrate an instance of misselling, and said algorithms will help flag such cases. ""We are working on the question of misselling that may happen by a mutual fund distributor or an agent or by someone who is the responsibility of the mutual fund,"" Buch said while speaking at the fourth Global Fintech Fest here. She admitted that this is a very complex problem requiring intelligence, and added that the algorithm being built will have the essential tools to detect misselling like flagging the case of a 90-year-old being sold the product with a long lock-in period. At present, mutual funds submit essential data to Sebi periodically with respect to compliance with regulations. A ""nil report"" is considered the best, Buch said. At the same time, Buch said there may be misselling that may go unnoticed in the rule-based supervision and those same will be detected with the AI tool. ""As we move to using AI to analyse the data, we hope that we will also find the ability to monitor these things (misselling) in the interest of the investors,"" she said. Meanwhile, Buch said the regulator is also keen to introduce fractional ownership of shares but the current legal set up does not allow it. ""Somebody came with that (idea) and we thought it was good... we would have wanted to welcome them into the innovation sandbox but it is not permitted in the Sebi Act itself. ""It cannot be done until we change the Act -- not just the Sebi Act, but also the Companies Act,"" she said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-working-on-ai-tool-to-curb-misselling-by-mutual-funds-buch/articleshow/103403684.cms

Experts say the craze for artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT and better campus placements last year drove more students towards engineering courses. Tamil Nadu Engineering Admissions (TNEA) committee on Sunday announced details of the third round of online general counselling. Of the eligible 89,695 candidates, 65,209 students participated in the counselling. Of them, 44,431 got seat allotment. In the three rounds, 95,046 students have got seats. This is an increase from 84,812 students last year. “Craze for artificial intelligence among students and campus placements are the main reasons for an increase in engineering admissions this year,” career consultant Jayaprakash Gandhi said. There is also a spike in the number of students who joined under 7.5% reservation for government school students from 8,263 admissions last year to 11,058 this year. Officials said students have five more days to join the colleges. Overall, of 1,60,780 seats available for counselling in 442 engineering colleges, 1,06104 seats have been filled. As many as 54,676 seats still remain vacant. The number of vacant seats is expected to further come down after the supplementary counselling. Of 16 colleges that filled 100% of their seats, 12 are government engineering colleges. “The tuition fees and hostel fees are higher in private engineering colleges. Hence many parents and students have preferred government colleges,” a professor said. Of 442 engineering colleges, 186 have filled more than 80% of their intake while 263 filled more than 50% of their sanctioned intake. As many as 61 colleges could fill less than 10% of their seats and among them 37 filled less than 10 seats and 11 colleges could not attract a single student. “Colleges with less than 10% of admissions could not run their colleges. It is very difficult for these colleges to run. Anna University should act to safeguard the interest of students,” Jayaprakash Gandhi said. Anna University is planning to conduct physical inspection of colleges with poor admissions after the counselling. Colleges said there is an improvement in admission numbers to the core branches this year. “Computer science engineering is still the most preferred course. But, mechanical engineering and civil engineering courses are also able to attract students in the counselling,” said B Chidambararajan, director of SRM Valliammai Engineering College. Besides computer science, courses such as IT, ECE, artificial intelligence and data science have also attracted more students.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/10k-more-engg-seats-allotted-so-far-this-year/articleshow/103336985.cms
2023-09-02,"'AI can curate learning, but ethics is catchword'",Amisha Rajani,"Representative Image HYDERABAD: Since the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is inevitable, educators must embrace it rather than stifling students' curiosity by deeming it impermissible, said Syed Akbaruddin , former permanent representative of India to the United Nations , on Friday. He explained how AI offers an opportunity to tailor and personalise learning experiences, a departure from the existing 'one-size-fits-all' educational model, which approaches learning assuming uniform competence of learners and neglects individual interests and potentials. During his address at the Educator's Conclave held at Hyderabad Public School in Begumpet, Akbaruddin highlighted how AI can be used effectively while keeping in mind its long-term implications. ""We did not stop learning numericals and exploring science and social studies with the advent of calculators and the internet. That means learning is a continuous process, which cannot be stopped due to innovation of technological tools. Although one needs to be mindful of the extent we are using it because if one is completely dependent on AI, it could hinder knowledge acquisition,"" he said, emphasising how the education system has not witnessed such fast-paced transformation as it is doing now after the invention of the printing press in the 15th century. Akbaruddin encouraged educators to integrate AI into their lessons and curriculum development. He said that this approach would not only help students understand the limits of AI but also help educators to understand its effectiveness in creating educational modules to cater to the individual needs of learners. Similarly, professor Anantha Durraiappah , director, UNESCO - Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Education for Peace and Sustainable Development, in his address 'How AI takes us to where no person has gone before' said: ""AI aims at rendering three Es - Efficiency, Effectiveness and Equity, but there is an overriding E, which is Ethics. Without the ethical mindset, we will go down a dystopian pathway with AI. In a short-term framework, ethics and guidelines are necessary, otherwise before we take over AI it will take over us."" He also called for responsible harnessing of AI in education and drawing boundaries in case of excessive usage.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ai-can-curate-learning-but-ethics-is-catchword/articleshow/103298213.cms

2023-08-31,Session held on artificial intelligence's use for both constructive and destructive purposes,TNN,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), like all technological innovations of the past, has both the good and the bad side. It can be used for public good, create jobs, perform many tasks better than human beings, promote large-scale automation. At the same time, it can have a negative impact by creating economic disparity, social anarchy, spreading misinformation and causing massive layoffs. This was stated today by Director, IIT Jammu, Prof Manoj Singh Gaur in a talk entitled: ‘Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Humanity’. The session was chaired by former DGP, Rajasthan, Kapil Garg, and was moderated by the Joint Director Tourism, Government of Rajasthan, Dr Punita Singh. Also present on the occasion was Director, Rajasthan International Center, NC Goel as well as a large number of senior officers, influencers, thought leaders, and students at the Rajasthan International Center. Audience at the session Elaborating further, Prof Manoj said that artificial intelligence will have a significant role to play in the healthcare industry, law enforcement, cyber security, agriculture and food as well as education. Increasingly, human beings will be taking assistance from AI for the above mentioned sectors. He said that it has also been found that the AI was performing the tasks even better than human beings but it was satisfying to note that human beings are in control of the AI. The professor also dwelled that over-reliance on AI will be at the cost of human innovation and creativity. Furthermore, AI could also be an information hazard in spreading misinformation, leakage of private data and also create social anarchy. To the delight of the audience, Prof Gaur also showed examples of how AI had created poems in the style of William Shakespeare, Ramdhari Singh Dinkar and Nirala. He also informed that while AI will be responsible for taking away the jobs of a news reporter, travel agent, content moderator, tutor, social media manager, etc.; however, it will not be able to replace the jobs of doctors, AI developers, mathematicians, hardware designers, etc. The session was followed by a Question and Answer session.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/events/jaipur/session-held-on-artificial-intelligences-use-for-both-constructive-and-destructive-purposes/articleshow/103256452.cms
2023-08-30,artificial intelligence could aid future viral outbreak response: Study,PTI,"NEW DELHI: Researchers have developed an innovative patient triage platform powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that they say can predict patient disease severity and length of hospitalisation during a viral outbreak . Triage is the prioritisation of patient care based on illness, severity, prognosis, and resource availability. The platform, described recently in the journal Human Genomics, leverages machine learning , a form of AI, and data from metabolomics - the study of small molecules related to cell metabolism. The innovation is intended to improve patient management and help healthcare providers allocate resources more efficiently during severe viral outbreaks that can quickly overwhelm local healthcare systems, the researchers said. ""Being able to predict which patients can be sent home and those possibly needing intensive care unit admission is critical for health officials seeking to optimise patient health outcomes and use hospital resources most efficiently during an outbreak,"" said senior study author Vasilis Vasiliou, a professor at Yale University, US. The researchers developed the platform using Covid-19 as a disease model. It integrates routine clinical data, patient comorbidity information, and untargeted plasma metabolomics data to drive its predictions. ""Our AI-powered patient triage platform is distinct from typical Covid-19 AI prediction models,"" said Georgia Charkoftaki, a lead author of the study and an associate research scientist at Yale. ""It serves as the cornerstone for a proactive and methodical approach to addressing upcoming viral outbreaks,"" Charkoftaki said. Using machine learning, the researchers built a model of Covid-19 severity and prediction of hospitalisation based on clinical data and metabolic profiles collected from patients hospitalized with the disease. ""The model led us to identify a panel of unique clinical and metabolic biomarkers that were highly indicative of disease progression and allows the prediction of patient management needs very soon after hospitalization,"" the researchers wrote in the study.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/artificial-intelligence-could-aid-future-viral-outbreak-response-study/articleshow/103214796.cms
2023-08-30,"Soon, AI to moderate screen content based on viewer age",Shishir Arya,"Nagpur: Screens of mobile phones or any other electronic device may soon be able to judge the viewer’s age and exercise discretion in screening content using artificial intelligence (AI). A research is under way on bringing better parental control, and even altering the contents depending on the viewers age directly using AI. Parental control is currently only possible through self-declaration or password protection. GlobalLogic , a mid-sized IT company under the Hitachi Group , is carrying out research for implementing smarter controls on the OTT medium at its facility in Nagpur’s Mihan-SEZ. The company, on Tuesday, opened its new centre of excellence which would be carrying out work on cutting edge technology for sectors like media, which includes OTT platforms, along with automotive and health care. The unit at Nagpur has 750 techies at present. The company plans to take the number to 1,000 in the next 12 months, said joint managing director Piyush Jha. He was in the city for the opening of the centre. With 15,000 workforce, GlobalLogic’s India business is pegged at $430 million. The Nagpur centre has been the site for work on a number of advanced research for a whole gamut of sectors. For example some of the automobile majors in Germany are served from the company’s centre in the city, an official told TOI. Even major telecommunication companies like US’ Verizon are served from here. Explaining the concept of OTT controls, Jha said systems are being developed that the viewers age may be identified on the basis of a image and then parental controls or even changes in content may be applied. For example, some objectionable scenes would be deleted or altered. Work is also under way for creating better systems for monitoring a car’s parameters. At present around 35 to 40 parameters related to the vehicle’s health at the most can be displayed on a screen. At GlobalLogic, research is being done to include as many as 400 parameters, which can be either seen on the mobile screen or the vehicle’s dashboard, said Jha. GlobalLogic is also scouting for takeovers, with 3 to 4 companies on the radar. These include two in Pune. It is open to take over companies with a turnover ranging from $20 million to $100 million, said Jha. The company’s presence in Nagpur can be traced back to the takeover of a local IT company, Lambent Technologies, by erstwhile Indus Logic, which later went on to become GlobalLogic. Over a year ago, it became a company owned by the Hitachi Group.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/soon-ai-to-moderate-screen-content-based-on-viewer-age/articleshow/103190461.cms
2023-08-30,"In AI age, CEOs worry how to manage people",Namrata Singh,"MUMBAI: At a time when AI tech has taken the world of business by storm, the people factor and company culture remain the primary concern for a CEO . In an exclusive interview to TOI, Joe Hart , global president and CEO, Dale Carnegie , said while a decade ago organisations were keen to equip people with presentation skills, today it's more about training around culture. ""I talk to CEOs and companies all over the world, including here in India, and the number one concern they have expressed is around people. The number two concern is around AI. These two are interchangeable depending on who you're talking to. But the people factor is really what CEOs are concerned about,"" said Hart, while adding that CEOs are ""frustrated"" with trying to manage a culture that might be hybrid/remote. The Long Island-based Dale Carnegie is one of the oldest global training companies. Hart said this is a very challenging time for leadership and that companies are looking for solutions around training. This has resulted in significant growth in Dale Carnegie's global accounts business after pandemic. Investments made by companies on training are said to have increased from four--five man-days a year in the pre-pandemic era to a month now. He said India figures among the top 20 performance franchisees out of its 200 operations across 86 countries, and is one of Dale Carnegie's best operations. ""India is a very important market for us globally. When we look at the growth in this economy, the sophistication of the companies and the technology in companies, we see this as a market that is serious about prime learning for significant continued growth,"" he added. A CEO told Hart he was having a hard time getting people to speak up. ""Culture is probably the most important thing to CEOs now that they don't have everyone in one place, five days a week. The second most important is creating higher performing teams and how people collaborate and communicate more effectively,"" said Hart. Earlier, even as there was unpredictability in terms of the world environment and the dynamic changes of technology, people was a more predictable factor, said Hart. Now that's changed, he said. Among other important factors for CEOs, said Hart, is the rise in new leaders - those who have been promoted to leadership roles but have never led people - especially in India. ""Companies want them to be successful and so they are investing in leadership training for them,"" said Hart. With technological developments, Hart sees skill development becoming important. As people leverage AI and technologies to become more productive, Hart said interpersonal skills will also become equally important in the years ahead. Some of the skills that might minimise things that are process-oriented or easily automated will force people to focus on higher impact skills such as creativity, emotional intelligence and human relations. ""We see a massive transformation in the workplace over the next 5-10 years. And one of the most important parts of that will be how people are trained,"" said Hart. Incidentally, a big demand put forth by companies in India to Dale Carnegie is for a training programme on 'how to learn'.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/in-ai-age-ceos-worry-how-to-manage-people/articleshow/103186309.cms

And the director reveals that he’s been using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help him pen his story. “I was extremely intrigued by the concept of using AI and when I began exploring it, I was taken aback by the kind of options it was showing me. I started out by suggesting a simple plot of a hero and heroine meeting and it went on to offer so many different possibilities of a love story. I was hooked,” shares Akash. The director has since engaged AI to pen the stories of the script he’s helming next. Akash Srivatsa “I’m simultaneously working on two stories and both are turning out extremely well. Usually, we work with co-writers while scripting our films. And when they’re not around, we sit around helplessly staring at walls! Recently, when my co-writer was held up, with the help of AI, I still managed to get a lot of work done,” he smiles, adding, “Some of the scenes, especially the emotional ones that it suggested were just beyond brilliant.” On the threat of AI taking over human jobs, he says: “I know there has been a lot of flak over this becoming a reality but I don’t see that happening in the immediate future. AI is a tool that can be used for help and not an end in itself. Cinema is a field of creative minds and AI is just another instrument that will aid in our job. It is not to be confused with replacing anything and everything.” AI cannot replace human emotions, he adds. “In Hollywood there’s a writers’ strike that is going on about the same issue. But let’s accept one thing: emotions are what makes us human and AI is just that — artificial.” “Cinema is all about emotions and AI can’t provide what a human mind can conceive and emote, which is primarily what we put into our plots. Use it wisely and don’t overdo it,” he says.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/im-using-ai-to-help-me-write-my-next-script-says-akash-srivatsa/articleshow/103139223.cms
2023-08-29,Government needs to lead AI investment: IBM CEO,Sujit John,"NEW DELHI: IBM chairman & CEO Arvind Krishna said India should build sovereign capability in artificial intelligence — including large language models and generative AI — to ensure the technology pervades critical sectors fast enough, and incentivises the private sector to jump into it. He said some level of upfront government investment is necessary for risky and expensive technologies for the private sector to feel confident enough to invest. He said the US and China already have national AI computer infrastructures. “The UAE and Saudi Arabia just announced investments. The UK is talking about a national AI incentive... France and Germany, too,” he said on Monday. Krishna was in Delhi for B20, a G20 dialogue forum. The Centre, he said, should set up a national AI computing centre with some government data sets in areas like agriculture, health, government processes, and apply AI to use cases in those areas. That, he said, would create a market. Krishna said a sovereign capability is also important because India might want to use AI for purposes the rest of the world does not want to invest in, or that it may not want to expose to other countries. He said the initiative will involve hundreds of millions of dollars, and that is “well within the capacity of India”. Given what the country has achieved with Chandrayaan-3, he said, it clearly has the confidence to take on big projects like these. Krishna said a national project of this nature would catalyse the opportunity In dia has in becoming a global hub of deploying AI solutions for the world. He said developing and deploying AI solutions for the world could become the third wave for India, after BPO and IT services. He said AI is what is exciting everybody right now. “Late last year, AI reached the point that I equate to the Netscape moment. Netscape really brought the internet to everybody’s attention, and I think it’s kind of like that with AI today. Now, the question is, what are the new business cases that can be built with it,” he said. It’s also a massive opportunity for IBM’s employees in India. The company is estimated to have over 1 lakh employees in the country, with many focused on AI. Krishna said they have researchers in India who are inventing in the AI space, doing “some of the deepest work we have going on in AI anywhere in the world”. But most are involved in deploying AI. While inventive skills take time to develop, and in ventions themselves may take time, deployment skills can be acquired in about three months. “How long do you think it takes us to get a chartered accountant working for us proficient in AI to be able to deeply improve a financial process? Three months,” he said. IBM was an early leader in AI with its Watson computing system that beat the best human champions in the quiz format Jeopardy in 2011. But today, OpenAI and Microsoft, with its investment in OpenAI, that’s on top of people’s minds when they think AI. Krishna, however, indicated that generative AI is really the result of all the AI investments Watson encouraged. “Watson winning Jeopardy woke everybody up to AI — that’s when the massive investment story began. And once that investment started, it has taken 10 years for the possible advantages to come to fruition. Today, if you’re not using AI for almost every task in IT, you’re going to be disadvantaged,” he said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/government-needs-to-lead-ai-investment-ibm-ceo/articleshow/103150820.cms

Stressing that it was important to let “innovation be our ally , and truth our guiding star”, he said news media would adapt, but its purpose would remain unaltered: “To inform, inspire, and empower.” Delivering a special address at exchange4media’s NEWSNEXT summit on Sunday, he said that as newer realms of broadcasting, digital tech and AI opened up, the challenge would be to uphold ethical standards, put out accurate information to maintain credibility and ensure that algorithms remain unbiased and content stays trustworthy. He added that he firmly believed that journalists are the best self-regulators and have been at the forefront of safeguarding India’s hard-fought media freedoms against external threats. Jain mentioned that as chief content architect of The Times Group, he had been driven by a core belief in democratising media and making news accessible to younger and mass audiences by using cutting-edge tools. He said he has always emphasised prescriptive journalism –where news entities not only highlight and report issues, but also offer solutions. Tracing the emergence of news from print to TV to digital to AI – a journey that he has traversed over 35 years -- he said AI is not about replacing tradition, but about amplifying it. “Imagine a world where news is tailored precisely to your interests, where data transforms into insightful stories.

2023-08-28,AI can't replace human element: HC,TNN,"Delhi high court NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court has held that artificial intelligence ( AI ) cannot substitute human intelligence or the human element in the adjudicatory process. It said that ChatGPT cannot be the basis for judging legal or factual issues in a court of law. Justice Prathiba M Singh rejected an attempt by a party in a suit to rely on ChatGPT results to bolster its claim of trademark infringement. The HC underlined that the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated data is still in the grey area, and such a tool, at best, can be utilised for preliminary understanding or research. ""The said tool (ChatGPT) cannot be the basis of adjudication of legal or factual issues in a court of law. The response of a Large Language Model (LLM)-based chatbot such as ChatGPT, which is sought to be relied upon by counsel for the plaintiff, depends upon a host of factors, including the nature and structure of the query put by the user, the training data, etc. Further, there are possibilities of incorrect responses, fictional case laws, imaginative data, etc, generated by AI chatbots,"" the HC noted in a recent order. The court's observation came while dealing with a lawsuit by a luxury brand against a partnership firm involved in the manufacture and sale of shoes allegedly in violation of its trademark. The counsel for the plaintiff submitted that a shoe name was its registered trademark in India, and placed before the court responses by ChatGPT with respect to its ""reputation"". However, the high court noted that the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated data is still in the grey area. ""There is no doubt in the mind of the court that at the present stage of technological development, AI cannot substitute either human intelligence or the humane element in the adjudicatory process. At best, the tool could be utilised for preliminary understanding or for preliminary research, and nothing more,"" the court observed. The court, in the end, held that on the basis of comparative analysis, the products of the defendant ""are knockoffs or lookalikes"" of the plaintiff's distinctive shoes and footwear. The defendant agreed to undertake that it would not copy or imitate any of the designs of the plaintiff's shoes. The court directed that in case of any breach of this undertaking, the defendant would be liable to pay Rs 25 lakh as damages to the plaintiff.

In an interview with PTI, Smith said AI can do more good for the people of India and the world than any other technological advance of this lifetime, but added that alongside that optimism he also believes there is a need to embrace the enormous responsibility that comes with AI and to get it right. AI - which will increasingly have a positive impact on everyday work and daily life - would need laws and regulations both at a national and international level, he said. Smith - who is also Microsoft Vice Chairperson - termed India's freshly-minted data protection legislation as ""a good law"", praised the digital public infrastructure here, and pointed out that India has become one of the most important countries for Microsoft. Microsoft will continue to hire and invest in the country is a ""foregone conclusion"", said the Microsoft honcho as he underlined the US tech giants's deep commitment to Indian market. ""When you think about Microsoft, India has become one of our most important countries, not just for customers, but for employees and for talent...even in a year where the tech sector in some respects needed to shed some jobs, India grew for Microsoft,"" Smith said. Microsoft, he pointed out, has more employees here today than it did 12 months ago. India's Digital Public Infrastructure also got a ringing endorsement from the Microsoft senior executive, who praised the nation's ""leadership"" in digital technology. No other country in the world has seen as much progress since 2020 as India when it comes to digital technology, he pointed out. India's digital public infrastructure is not just advancing but has drawn increased interest from other nations who want to replicate it, he said on the triad of identity, payments and data management framework being showcased by the country. ""When I look at the situation here in India today in comparison to say 12 months ago when I was here, what we're seeing is this digital public infrastructure not only continuing to advance here, but increasingly other countries wanting to embrace it. So this G20 meeting is, I think, a very important opportunity for India. It is a showcase for the world of everything that is going forward here, including India's leadership in digital technology,"" he said. On the need for global guardrails on AI, he affirmed that laws and regulations will indeed be required. ""We need to make safety a priority and that does require that kind of law or regulation. I don't think it's really possible to slow the pace of technology. So I don't think the answer is to ask technology developers to slow down. I think the answer is to ask those of us who really implement controls, safeguards and laws to move faster,"" he advocated. To a question about prominent tech voices sounding an alarm about the dangers posed to humanity by AI, Smith said he is optimistic about the technology but that there is a need to embrace ""the enormous responsibility that we have"". ""I think we should get up every morning and look at both sides of that coin in a very clear-eyed way. If we do that, if we think broadly, if we act with determination, we will serve humanity well. That has to be our first priority,"" he said adding that building safeguards is ""quite rightly"" one of the big topics of discussion in 2023. It is pertinent to mention here that over the past months, many global experts and tech leaders have cautioned about the existential threat to humanity from AI, arguing that it needs to be considered a societal risk at par with pandemics and nuclear wars. The rise of AI and large language models (generative AI) have led to growing alarm on the potential harms of artificial intelligence, including its possible weaponisation to spread misinformation and propaganda, or even its role in culling millions of white-collar jobs.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/not-possible-to-slow-tech-pace-answer-is-in-safeguards-laws-to-move-faster-microsoft-president-on-ai-regulations/articleshow/103114564.cms
2023-08-28,â€˜Gen AIâ€™s impact will be as big as printing pressâ€™,Shilpa Phadnis&Sujit John,"Everybody in the tech world, and even outside it, is talking about generative AI today. That’s also what we discussed with Brad Smith, Microsoft’s VC & president, who is in India to be part of the G20 dialogue forum with the global business community. Smith joined Microsoft 30 years ago and today, he’s representing it publicly on critical issues involving the intersection of technology and society. Microsoft is at the centre of the gen AI world with its massive investment in OpenAI — the non-profit that developed ChatGPT . Excerpts: Is it gen AI that excites you the most right now? It’s fair to say that this is the year of AI, and gen AI is obviously the focal point. It’s one of the years that I think will stand out historically as an inflection point for the history of technology and the tech sector. Gen AI will probably be more transformative for people’s lives than any other invention of our lifetime. Give us a sense of this transformation you expect. After ChatGPT first came out, we were talking about if it’s like the iPhone or the internet or electricity... we’ve had time to reflect on it and my view is that it is probably most similar to the printing press . The printing press was perfected by Gutenberg in 1462 with movable type, and it made knowledge accessible to more people. Similarly, I think gen AI is a tool to help people learn and research. I experience that myself when I use something like Bing chat or what we’re now developing — the M365 Copilot. It’s a tool that one can use to create, to write more quickly, to turn a Word document into a PowerPoint deck and vice versa. It’s a tool that people who write code for a living are using to write more of their code. But we call it a co-pilot, not an autopilot... you need to continue to think. Just like the printing press, it can copy books but you are still needed to write and read them. And when one puts it in those terms, you start to see how it can make its way into every area of knowledge work that we have. There are concerns that gen AI involves huge costs & energy consumption, that OpenAI is bleeding… We’re still in relatively early days. I think we will see largescale models that, in effect, can be used to do many things. GPT-4 is a good example of that. I think you’ll see other narrower models, including open-source models, that probably won’t do as many things well, but they may do one or two things as well as a largescale model. Not everything is going to be larger and there’s a lot of innovation in our future to try to understand how these things come together. There are concerns about the damage AI could do in the absence of regulations We need companies to create own guardrails, and that’s what we’ve been doing for seven years now. We need to strengthen and add resources to the work we’re doing on something like, say, red teaming, so that when we’re working with OpenAI on the development of a new model, there is an independent red team at work to look at potentially sensitive uses, identify potential problems, and put in place measures to protect against them. Similarly, for each application — put a red team to work and identify the kinds of problems they can result in. Then you fundamentally create an AI safety architecture.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/gen-ais-impact-will-be-as-big-as-printing-press/articleshow/103114534.cms

2023-08-25,Meta launches new AI-powered coding tool to take on ChatGPT,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Meta has announced a new large language model (LLM) that can use text prompts to generate and discuss code. Called Code Llama, the tool is meant for publicly available LLMs on coding tasks. “It has the potential to make workflows faster and more efficient for developers and lower the barrier to entry for people who are learning to code,” said Meta in a blog post. Further, the company said that Code Llama has the potential to be used as a productivity and educational tool to help programmers write more robust, well-documented software. What can Code Llama do? According to Meta, the model features enhanced coding capabilities and can generate code and natural language about code, from both code and natural language prompts . For instance, users can say “Write me a function that outputs the fibonacci sequence” and Code Llama will generate code on that basis. Furthermore, it can also be used for code completion and debugging. It supports many of the most popular programming languages used today, including Python, C++, Java, PHP, Typescript (Javascript), C#, Bash and more. With the new model, Meta is taking an aim at ChatGPT , which has reportedly become quite popular among coders. Github also has a OpenAI-powered coding tool whereas Amazon too has a similar model that helps people write code. There are reports about Google also working on a code writing AI tool. Meta said that programmers are already using LLMs to assist in a variety of tasks. “The goal is to make developer workflows more efficient so that they can focus on the most human-centric aspects of their job, rather than repetitive tasks,” the company said. Like its other AI tools and models, Meta has made Code Llama also open source and made available to everyone. “We believe that AI models, and LLMs for coding in particular, benefit most from an open approach, both in terms of innovation and safety,” said Meta.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//gadgets-news/meta-launches-new-ai-powered-coding-tool-to-take-on-chatgpt/articleshow/103038913.cms
2023-08-25,artificial intelligence will create more jobs in India: N Chandrasekaran,PTI,"NEW DELHI: Artificial intelligence will create more jobs in India as it will empower more people with little skill or no skill to perform higher level jobs, B20 India Chair N Chandrasekaran said on Friday. In a panel discussion at the B20 Summit India 2023, Chandrasekaran, who is also the Chairman of Tata Sons , said India has made a ""fantastic breakthrough"" towards data privacy and protection by taking a techno-legal approach. Seeking to address concerns over privacy and jobs with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), he said, ""Actually in a country like us, it (AI) will create jobs because it will empower people with the little skill or no skill, will empower them with information skill so that they can perform a higher level of jobs."" He cited the example of a nurse and said due to AI ""the nurse will be able to take away the workload of a doctor and that's the way we are going to scale up"". Chandrasekaran, however, stated that the impact of AI will play out in different markets and different segments of the society differently. ""We talk about a country like India, we say that hundreds of millions of people have to have access...Additional 250 to 300 million people are coming into the market. They have access to information, they have access to goods and services in their own way, they start consuming, it just multiplies the whole GDP to a different level and then their per capita income goes up and we will see the benefit for a very, very long time,"" he said. On the other hand, he said the ageing economies are also going to face longevity and all these people have to be taken care of and they don't have enough human resources to provide the kind of service that needed to be provided to support these people once they get aged. ""Again, AI will come in handy or play a very very important role because a vast majority of the things that need to be taken care of can be done by AI. So the benefits are going to be different to different segments and in different markets but everywhere (AI) is going to create jobs, it is going to empower people to do high levels of jobs,"" Chandrasekaran asserted. In markets where there are no people it is going to substitute for human beings and provide the service that is expected, he added. On data privacy and protection, Chandrasekaran said, ""I do believe that India has made a big breakthrough in this whole privacy space. India has taken a technical legal approach."" He further said, ""On the one hand, we got the regulation for data privacy and data protection. On the other hand, we have created DEPA, which is data empowerment and protection architecture. Both working together we are able to very safely secure with consent, any transaction and sharing of data at aggregate level with complete security, protecting privacy."" DEPA is the technology architecture that provides data empowerment and protection architecture creating the necessary public infrastructure architecture on which private applications can be built. ""It has got digital consent completely embedded. So any sharing can be done at an aggregate level with the proper consent. It is a fantastic breakthrough I feel because it is very different from the traditional approach of over engineering the laws and regulatory framework, which is totally punitive,"" Chandrasekaran said. The approach of having laws where there is a violation, the legal recourse will be a very strong set of damages that cannot be put in a country like India, ""because there's no way that people will pay"", he added. ""So the better way is to integrate a technology architecture with the legal framework. It is something to be studied and championed outside India,"" Chandrasekaran said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ai-will-create-more-jobs-in-india-n-chandrasekaran/articleshow/103054044.cms
2023-08-25,"Delhi G-20 Summit: Intrusion alert, AI-based cameras to secure hotel",Raj Shekhar,"Delhi G20 Summit NEW DELHI: From using advance intrusion alert systems and posture-detection mechanism to deploying DCP-rank officers as 'venue commanders' - the security establishment is learnt to have put in place elaborate arrangements to secure the hotels where foreign dignitaries, including heads of states, will stay during the upcoming G20 summit, according to sources. Top Picks For You Ahead of G20 summit, cops enforce Section 144 in northeast Delhi The task has been one of the biggest security challenges for intelligence agencies and Delhi Police. While the agencies are coordinating with their foreign counterparts who will form the immediate security cordon, Delhi Police is working on the communicated inputs as well as its own strategy to make the venues foolproof. The intrusion alert and posture-detection systems will help cops filter out suspicious movements. ""The advanced AI-based cameras and software will raise the alarm and alert security if any person is caught scaling the wall or shows unusual body movements, like crawling or limping with a bent back,"" an officer told TOI. Explaining the nitty-gritty of the security apparatus, an intelligence official said each hotel is being treated as a separate venue, where a DCP-rank officer has been designated as a 'venue commander'. The hotels in central Delhi, Aerocity and Gurgaon have been divided into two zones, with a special commissioner rank officer in charge of each. Hotel staffers have been verified over multiple rounds, said another official. The special branch and Delhi Police special cell began vetting the employees in July and conducted extensive background checks. The security inside the hotel has been planned strategically after extensive discussions with foreign and domestic stakeholders. It has been decided that there would be separate sets of staffers for each floor and their movement will be contained to that floor at all times. This is being done to ensure that the security personnel deal only with 'visibly identified' staffers. ""The staffer of one floor will not have access to any other floor. They will use specially programmed key cards during the summit for entry and exit,"" an officer said. The cops and security personnel will have three rooms to themselves, two of which will be converted to security control rooms under the venue commander, an official at the police headquarters said. ""One room will be the main control centre of that hotel which will be connected to the main command centre and police control room, C4i (command, control, communication, computing and intelligence). The other will be the contingency room on another floor,"" the officer added. Meanwhile, LG V K Saxena Thursday reviewed the preparedness and security arrangements while assigning specific tasks to DCPs. He asked police to keep track of posts and trends on social media to ensure no inflammatory content is posted and to prevent rumour mongering. While state borders will remain sealed during the summit, there will be extra vigil at malls, markets, monuments and places of worship by quick response teams, commando units and strike forces with special vehicles. The LG was informed that 60 DCPs had been drafted to manage tasks related to the summit, including security in and around the venue, IGI airport, hotels, sites designated for visits by spouses and traffic routes of the delegations. A DCP each has been assigned responsibilities of hotels housing the delegates, meeting locations and places to be visited by their spouses. DCPs have also been put in charge of routes to be undertaken by the dignitaries. An elaborate contingency plan in and around hospitals to facilitate emergency medical care is also being planned. Saxena stressed on ensuring cordial behaviour with delegates, tourists and the public at large at all times by police personnel. ""Parking at all places by all agencies, including Delhi Police, should comply with rules. All public pathways and medians are to be kept free of encroachment,"" he added.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-g-20-summit-intrusion-alert-ai-based-cameras-to-secure-hotel/articleshow/103037487.cms

2023-08-21,"In AI age, India Inc gets young on board as independent directors",Reeba Zachariah,"MUMBAI: India Inc is making its boards look younger. At 31, Binoy Parikh , an executive director at Katalyst Advisors, was recently named the youngest independent director in India Inc. Sarda Energy & Minerals, with a market capitalization of over Rs 6,600 crore, took Parikh on board. At 34, Upasana Kamineni Konidela, MD of Family Health Plan Insurance TPA, was inducted as the youngest woman independent director by the Rs 65,000-crore market cap company, Zydus Lifesciences. Konidela is the granddaughter of Apollo Hospitals founder Prathap Reddy . At 34, MapmyIndia CEO RohanVerma joined Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company, which manages assets over Rs 75,000 crore, as an independent director four years ago. In a country where millennials make up the largest share of the workforce, India Inc is trying to board young executives as independent directors. ""Bringing on young independent directors adds dynamism and new-age thinking to corporate boards. It also helps in bridging the age diversity gap on the boards of companies,"" said Parikh. Embracing age diversity could be a game-changer for many large companies. Organizations focus on age as they look to respond to disruptions in their sectors as well as to the rise of new technologies like blockchain and AI. ""While one cannot take away from the wisdom and rich experience of senior independent directors, young individuals have a different perspective in a rapidly changing business environment and consumer profile. They understand digital and related technologies and can advise the board on how these can be used to reach consumers,"" Parikh added. Indian boardrooms are rebooting, says Monica Agrawal , MD (financial services - Asia Pacific) at Korn Ferry , an international talent search firm. ""The evolving landscape of technology, customer dynamics, and workforce composition has accentuated the value of generational diversity in the boardrooms. Therefore, business leaders in their late 30s and 40s are finding representation on boards, which are actively considering strategies to strengthen their competitive advantage and are thoughtfully incorporating both youthful vigour and mature wisdom by making appointments that augment management team capabilities so that they are a strategic asset,"" Agrawal added. In March, Sharekhan BNP Paribas Financial Services roped in Arjun Mohan (37), former CEO of UpGrad, as an independent director. The boardroom experience is helping young leaders gain valuable lessons early on in their careers. ""My experience as an independent director at Chola has certainly helped me in MapmyIndia's journey as a public company. We could execute a successful IPO in 2021 and have also been able to manage well as a public company post-IPO,"" said Verma. More than 800 independent director positions will open up in a year's time. This is because Sebi mandates that independent directors can stay on the board for no more than two five-year terms. Companies, then, can look to fill seats with younger candidates. ""The demographics for India as a market suggest that almost 75% of the population is under 40 years. To understand the behaviour of this segment, their aspirations, and their needs, the boardroom should also have this representation,"" said Suresh Raina , partner, Heidrick & Struggles, an international talent search firm.

2023-08-20,The desperate hunt for AI boom's most indispensable asset,NYT News Service,"San Francisco: For the past year, Jean Paoli, CEO of the artificial intelligence startup Docugami, has been scrounging for what has become the hottest commodity in tech: computer chips. In particular, Paoli needs a type of chip known as a graphics processing unit, or GPU, because it is the fastest and most efficient way to run the calculations that allow cutting-edge AI companies to analyze enormous amounts of data. So he's called everyone he knows in the industry for help. He's applied for a government grant that allows access to the chips. He's tried making Docugami's AI technology more efficient so it requires fewer GPUs. Two of his scientists have even repurposed old video gaming chips . ""I think about it as a rare earth metal at this point,"" Paoli said of the chips. More than money, engineering talent, hype or even profits, tech companies this year are desperate for GPUs. The hunt for the essential component was kicked off last year when online chatbots like ChatGPT set off a wave of excitement over AI, leading the entire tech industry to pile on and creating a shortage of the chips. In response, startups and their investors are now going to great lengths to get their hands on the tiny bits of silicon and the crucial ""compute power"" they provide. The dearth of AI chips has been exacerbated because Nvidia, a longtime provider of the chips, has a virtual lock on the market. Inundated with demand, the Silicon Valley company - which has surged to a $1 trillion valuation - is expected to report record financial results next week. Tech companies typically buy access to AI chips and their compute power through cloud computing services from the likes of Google, Microsoft and Amazon. But the AI explosion has meant that there are long wait lists - stretching to almost a year in some cases - to access these chips at cloud computing companies, creating an unusual roadblock at a time when the tech industry sees nothing but opportunity and boundless growth for businesses building generative AI, which can create its own images, text and video. The largest tech firms can generally get their hands on GPUs more easily because of their size, deep pockets and market positions. That has left startups and researchers, which typically do not have the relationships or spending power, scrambling. Their desperation is palpable. On social media, blogposts and conference panels, startup founders and investors have started sharing highly technical tips for navigating the shortage. Some are gaming out how long they think it will take Nvidia's wait-list to clear. There's even a groan-worthy YouTube song, set to the tune of Billy Joel's 'We Didn't Start the Fire,' in which an artist known as Weird A.I. Yankochip sings ""GPUs are fire, we can never find 'em but we wanna buy 'em."" Some venture capital firms are now using their connections to buy chips and then offering them to their portfolio companies. Entrepreneurs are rallying startups and research groups together to buy and share a cluster of GPUs. At Docugami, Paoli weighed the possibility of diverting GPU resources from research and development to his product, an AI service that analyzes documents. Two weeks ago, he struck gold: Docugami secured access to the computing power it needed through a US government program called Access, which is run by the National Science Foundation, a federal agency that funds science and engineering. The strain recently prompted two founders, Evan Conrad and Alex Gajewski, to start the San Francisco Compute Group, a project that plans to let entrepreneurs and researchers buy access to GPUs in small amounts. After hundreds of emails and a dozen phone calls to cloud companies, equipment makers and brokers, they announced last month that they had secured 512 of Nvidia's H100 chips and would rent them out to interested parties. The announcement went ""hilariously viral,"" Conrad said, and resulted in hundreds of messages from founders, graduate students and other research organizations. Conrad and Gajewski plan to raise $25 million in a specialized kind of debt that uses the computer chips as collateral. Their vendor, whom the founders declined to name for fear that someone would swoop in and buy the GPUs out from under them, has promised access in around a month. The duo said they hoped to help startups save money by buying only the computing power they need to experiment, rather than making large, years-long commitments. ""Otherwise, the incumbents all win,"" Conrad said. nyt",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/the-desperate-hunt-for-ai-booms-most-indispensable-asset/articleshow/102866764.cms
2023-08-18,Why The New York Times may sue the company behind ChatGPT,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"It was perhaps a problem that was just waiting to emerge. With generative AI making its presence felt and a lot of users relying on it to create content, it was a matter of time when the copyright issue came into play, especially when it is ‘original’ content. According to a report by NPR, The New York Times is exploring the possibility of suing OpenAI , the company behind ChatGPT, the popular chatbot. The report reveals that the publication and OpenAI have been in talks over a licensing deal. The New York Times wants OpenAI to pay for all the content — news stories, articles — that the AI firm uses for its tools like ChatGPT. However, the negotiations have reportedly gone sour and, as per NPR, the publication is looking at a potential lawsuit. The newspaper is keen to protect all the intellectual property rights that come with the reportage done for news stories. Why the matter may end up in court According to the report, senior executives at the publication believe ChatGPT is emerging as a competitor based on writings that appeared in the paper. ChatGPT can create text and answer questions based on information that may have appeared in the publication. AI tools like ChatGPT can cite sources but also rephrase the original text that was carried out in the publication first. The worry, for NYT , here is that a lot of users may not end up visiting its own website. There are laws against copyright issues when it comes to artificial intelligence tools. The report indicates that if the case does end up in court and OpenAI is found guilty of the violation of copyrights, then the law does suggest all the articles/text needs to be removed. Getty Images has already filed a copyright case against Stability AI for using millions of images without authorisation. If the licensing deal between OpenAI and the publication falls through, it could have massive implications on how AI tools generate content.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//gadgets-news/why-the-new-york-times-may-sue-the-company-behind-chatgpt/articleshow/102816596.cms

2023-08-17,Googleâ€™s testing an AI chatbot that could be your personal life coach,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Feeling low, confused, and do not know what to do anymore. Worry not anymore. Google 's testing an AI chatbot that could be your new source of wisdom, just a chat away! Google is working on a generative AI chatbot, like Bard and ChatGPT – which could give users life lessons when in the time of need. And this is just one of the tasks that Google's DeepMind team has been working on. There are at least 21 different types of tasks, including personal and professional, such as planning, tutoring, and ideas that the folks at Google are currently working on to bake these into the chatbot. To assess the chatbot’s proficiency in answering intimate queries, Google has reportedly partnered with the contractor Scale AI , with a team of over 100 experts working with doctorates in various fields. You may wonder what type of questions it could answer. Well, an ideal prompt would go like this, “I have a really close friend who is getting married this winter. She was my college roommate and a bridesmaid at my wedding. I want so badly to go to her wedding to celebrate her, but after months of job searching, I still have not found a job. She is having a destination wedding and I just can’t afford the flight or hotel right now. How do I tell her that I won’t be able to come?” Google hopes users can benefit from an idea creation feature, having tailored suggestions and recommendations based on their situation. Meanwhile, tutoring could help users improve their skills and acquire new ones, such as learning to be better runner. The planning capability should also enable users to effortlessly create personalised financial budgets, meal plans, and workout routines. Unlike OpenAI, Google has taken a cautious approach with Bard. Google's Bard help pages clearly advise against relying on its responses for professional advice, such as medical, legal, or financial. In December, Google's A.I. Safety experts cautioned that relying on AI for life advice could have negative effects on users' health, well-being, and sense of control. They also warned that some users may even mistakenly attribute sentience to the technology if they become overly dependent on it. Google often collaborates with several partners to assess their research and products, a crucial aspect of creating secure and valuable technology, said a spokesperson for DeepMind. The spokesperson notes that there are multiple evaluations taking place at once, and individual instances of evaluation data cannot accurately depict a company's product roadmap. So, it seems like these tools are still under testing and may not even make it out to the public’s hands.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//gadgets-news/googles-testing-an-ai-chatbot-that-could-be-your-personal-life-coach/articleshow/102780976.cms

2023-08-14,AI-powered cameras to watch over Nagarahole Tiger Reserve,TNN,"Mysuru: Two AI-powered cameras will monitor the forest at the Veeranahosalli wildlife range in Nagarahole Tiger Reserve. They can share real-time footage up to 5km radius with forest officials and villagers on various platforms, including WhatsApp and Telegram. They are designed to curb the human-animal conflict on the forest fringes. These AI-powered cameras will have dedicated applications to identify various objects related to forests, including human beings, to keep an eye on hunters from trespassing into the forest. On a pilot basis, two cameras are being installed using solar power. They function round the clock with solar power. It is being implemented at an estimated cost of Rs 30-Rs35 lakh with the CSR support of TVS, said Harshakumar Chikkanaragund, director, Nagarahole Tiger Reserve. According to the IFS officer, through these two cameras, the forest department staff can monitor the movement of wild animals, human beings, and other developments, in a 5km radius. “We are now working on developing the applications to enable the AI-enabled cameras to identify various animals, and other subjects, and send us alerts. It will help the patrolling teams to keep an eye on the happenings in the forest areas, while on the move from one place to another,” he explained. Based on the outcome of the pilot project, this new system will be expanded to other areas, he added. Authorities informed that apart from getting information about the movement of wild animals, it will help the department to keep an eye on the illegal activities inside the forest. Officials informed that the new system is likely to be functional in the next couple of weeks, giving a technological edge to the department in its fight in conserving the forest and wildlife. Former State Wildlife Board member and wildlife activist Joseph Hoover said experimenting with the technology to conserve the forest and wild animals is a good idea.“Earlier CCTVs were used with similar ideas, but the results were not great. Let us wait for the results of this pilot project, which is for the first time in the state,” he said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/ai-powered-cameras-to-watch-over-nagarahole-tiger-reserve/articleshow/102707651.cms

2023-08-13,Google may be working on an AI writing tool for ChromeOS,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"At I/O 2023, Google announced that its products and services will get artificial intelligence capabilities over time. After rolling out various AI-powered features to Gmail , Docs, Slides , and more, the company may be working on bringing the AI writing and editing feature for Chromebooks . According to 9to5mac, Google has been working on a project that has at least five codenames associated with it, the main three being “Orca,” “Mako,” and “Manta.” The report claimed that “Orca” will primarily appear in ChromeOS ’s right-click menu but only when editing a body of text. When selected, Orca will open the “Mako” UI in a “bubble” over your screen, the report said. What does "" Mako "" do? Citing a code, the report noted that ""Mako"" has three core tasks: it can “request rewrites” of a particular piece of text; it can offer a list of “preset text queries,” and “insert” the rewritten text wherever you were originally typing. According to the report, this AI rewriting process doesn’t happen locally on the PC, and “Manta” apparently sends users' original text and prompt to Google’s servers, which send back the AI-enhanced version. It is also noted that users will have to agree to provide consent before the process takes place. Furthermore, by being directly incorporated into ChromeOS, generative AI will be available to improve text written in almost any app. There is no clarity on when the feature will launch, but it may arrive with ChromeOS version 118, scheduled to arrive in mid-October. Microsoft Windows Copilot It is to be noted that Microsoft, earlier this year, announced Copilot for Windows. It said that the Copilot, which will be similar to Bing Chat , can help users undertake day-to-day tasks such as enabling the dark mode or searching for content from a sidebar that can be accessed at any time.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//gadgets-news/google-may-be-be-working-on-an-ai-writing-tool-for-chromeos/articleshow/102689780.cms

2023-08-04,AI can make breast cancer detection easier,Durgesh Nandan Jha,"NEW DELHI: Artificial intelligence-supported mammography analysis is as good as two radiologists working together to detect breast cancer, Swedish researchers have claimed in a study published in ‘The Lancet Oncology ’ journal. In a resource-constrained country like India, experts say use of AI can revolutionise diagnosis and breast cancer treatment. In the study, the first randomised controlled trial to investigate the use of AI in mammography screening, 80,033 Swedish women aged 40-80 years who had undergone mammogram were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either AI-supported analysis, where a commercially available AI-supported system analysed the mammograms before they were also read by one or two radiologists, or standard analysis by two radiologists between April 2021 and July 2022. Researchers found that AI-supported screening resulted in a cancer detection rate of six per 1,000 screened women compared to five per 1,000 for standard double reading without AI. Also, the use of AI did not increase false positives and reduced the mammogram reading workload by 44%. “While our AI-supported system requires at least one radiologist in charge of detection, it could potentially do away with the need for double reading of most of the mammograms,” Dr Kristina Lång, lead author of the study, said. AI has shown encouraging results in retrospective studies using the technology to triage examinations to either single or double reading and by providing radiologists with computer-aided detection marks highlighting suspicious features to reduce false negative results. But, the new study has for the first time provided robust evidence. Artificial Intelligence predicts the outcome of a diagnostic or prognostic process by using its experience that is based on data of previous patients that were used to train the AI system. It may be considered as a super-calculator that reduces our error rate. “AI can extract information from natural language processing, helping detect patterns and information that would otherwise be hidden in electronic data. The future of AI would involve all healthcare fields etc,” Dr Prateek Sharma , who was the first chair of US task force of AI, told TOI in a recent interview.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ai-can-make-breast-cancer-detection-easier/articleshow/102404076.cms

No new road will be laid in the future unless the old layer is scrapped off, uniformity in all speedbreakers across Goa will be brought within eight months and structural audit of all minor bridges and their repairs will be taken up, said Cabral. The minister said that the principal chief engineer of PWD Uttam Parsekar is now personally monitoring the removal of all illegal structures along national highways. “Under CSR funds, signals are put up and then not maintained. All signals put on PWD roads will be taken over by PWD. Entire mechanism of policing will also be done using signals within next one year. We will use AI. All those breaking rules will be fined,” Cabral said. He said that rectification of 33 accident prone zones and 23 black spots is presently going on. “We will extensively study culverts, minor bridges. Structural audit will be done. The exercise will be taken up immediately after the monsoon and repairs will be taken up immediately if they are found to be in a bad condition,” said Cabral. The minister said that despite the Union ministry of road transport and highways providing Goa over Rs 14,000 crore for different highway works, there are presently bottlenecks remaining at Western Bypass, Porvorim and Verna, due to opposition to projects. Cabral said that the NHAI has now said that the project of twin towers atop the new Zuari bridge cannot be made part of the highway expansion work and therefore it is being taken up now on PPP basis. The second section of the new Zuari bridge will open in December for use, he said. He said the PWD is also in the process of identifying land to construct toilet blocks all along the highway wherever there is land available. “We have outsourced jetpatchers. Seven working in the state, four in North Goa and three in South Goa. There have been no complaints wherever the potholes have been repaired using jetpatchers,” Cabral said. He said that a crash barrier policy will also be put in place to have damaged barriers repaired within 72 hours, as in many places miscreants are found stealing the nuts and bolts for profit, leaving the barriers compromised. Within the next three months, said Cabral, the PWD app will be ready to enable users to report all issues under PWD at one place, including lack of water supply, broken signages. “We will soon have contractors on board to keep the speedbreakers painted. It can be reported and we will get it done. Each speedbreaker cannot have of a different height. The officers have assured me that within eight months all speedbreakers will be made uniform and repaired. After this period, if there are complaints, we will suspend officers responsible,” said Cabral. He said that all government buildings in dilapidated condition will be repaired by the PWD on PPP-basis. Arlem to Nuvem road will be four-laned with all safety measures, Cabral said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pwd-to-convert-all-traffic-signals-to-ai-systems-cabral/articleshow/102403292.cms
2023-08-01,"Investigators to wear bodycams, use AI for Ayushman audit in MP",Jamal Ayub,"BHOPAL: Sleuths appointed by MP health department will wear body cameras while auditing medical claims under the Ayushman Bharat scheme . Use of body-cams outside law enforcement would be a first. Another first, is appointing a third-party audit agency for medical claims and hospital field audits. Ahead of the elections, free medical treatment provided in MP through the scheme has touched a new high. Collection of all documentary and digital evidences — photos, photocopies, patient statements, videos etc — will fall under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. It will include hospital premises and beneficiary audit (post-hospitalisation). The proposal comes in the backdrop of Ayushman Bharat Niramayam in Madhya Pradesh (ABN-MP) getting 12 lakh claims in the last year alone. In simple numbers, 40% of all treatments have been in the last year. As many as 30 lakh medical claims are provided under the scheme. “Number of people with ABN-MP to conduct the audit is not sufficient. It would be a first of a kind ‘third party’ audit,” said an ABN-MP official. The new audit methodology will use a lot of new tech. The proposal does not miss out to mention use of artificial intelligence (AI), a new-found fancy for MP health department, in its announcements. Private hospitals are not excited by the 111-page proposal. Over 65% of mediclaims in the last year are from about 517 empanelled private hospitals in MP. Time and again, there have been minimalist feelers by hospitals about the need for ABN-MP to expedite payment process. Widely-accepted 30-day timeline seldom met for the cashless medical insurance scheme. “There are noted substantial delays in payments to hospitals under the scheme. Pending payments of private hospitals are in crores. Worst affected are medium to small private hospitals due to the delay in disbursement,” said MP nursing home association (Bhopal branch) president, Dr Randhir Singh. Rs 1,980 crore worth of claims were received in 2022-23. ABN-MP official are tight lipped on payments pendency. At the moment, doctors working for ABN-MP, bond period doctors and retired doctors conduct the audit. Estimated numbers of indicative audit to be rendered by third party is pegged at 1.8 lakh claims. It is divided into various categories. If 1.8 lakh is the effective number, it would be about 7% of all the claims received last year.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/investigators-to-wear-bodycams-use-ai-for-ayushman-audit-in-mp/articleshow/102294689.cms

Lalbazar has issued a warning to citizens, asking them to be on the alert. “Cyber frauds, with the latest technology in hand, trick victims into thinking that they are talking to a relative or even a family member like a parent or one’s child in urgent need of money for reasons like paying for damages from a car accident or getting stuck on a tour. Rather than calls, voice messages are being sent to stop any kind of possible cross-questioning. Since these messages are coming in voices replicating family members, it is throwing the victims off guard,” warned a senior officer of Lalbazar cyber cell . Cops are asking citizens to check if such messages are being sent from a number which does not belong to their relatives or friends. “One should immediately call back on the original number of the relative whose voice one has just heard or call someone present with the relative to check the veracity of the message. Do not act in haste,” said DC (cyber) Atul V. According to experts, voice cloning involves using an advanced deep learning algorithm that takes in voice recordings of an individual and can synthesize such a voice to the point where it can replicate a human voice with great accuracy of tone and likeness. While it just takes 3.7 seconds to try to create a clone, conversations lasting 12-15 minutes provide the more accurate results.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/now-cyber-crooks-use-ai-to-clone-voice/articleshow/102294533.cms
2023-08-01,Instagram wants to use AI to tell you if an image is real or â€˜fake',TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"So far, Meta’s approach to AI hasn’t been customer facing. Microsoft, Google have been using tools that can be used — or are beneficial directly — by users. Meta’s AI work has been more in the background. However, it looks like Meta will use AI a bit more directly. According to reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, Instagram may soon have a feature that will tell users if an image has been generated using AI. Paluzzi shared a couple of screenshots which showed labels that detailed if an image was created using generative AI tools. “The creator or Meta said that this content was created or edited with AI,” reads one of the labels. There are other labels as well, including one which tells if the image has been generated by Meta AI . Another label reads “content created with AI is typically labeled so that it can be easily detected.” Meta was one of the seven big companies that met with US vice president Kamala Harris and pledged to use AI responsibly and safeguard user interests. Interestingly, one of the things that the company had committed to was letting users know if any content has been created using generative AI. “Watermarking audio and visual content to help make it clear that content is AI-generated,” is one of the measures that companies will take. Meta’s ‘different’ approach to AI What Meta is also doing — something Google, and OpenAI are cautious over — is that it is making its AI tools open source. In other words, it is giving developers, companies access to copy, modify or reuse for their own benefits. In February 2023, Meta announced that LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) will be available for those “affiliated with organisations in government, civil society, and academia; and industry research laboratories around the world.” The company has also an AI partnership with Microsoft.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//gadgets-news/instagram-wants-to-use-ai-to-tell-you-if-an-image-is-real-or-fake/articleshow/102293762.cms
2023-07-31,Delhi govt explores AI hub in proposed electronic city,Atul Mathur,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi government is considering the establishment of an artificial intelligence hub at its proposed electronic city in southwest Delhi's Baprola. To be set up on an 81-acre plot of land, the electronic city will be designed to provide plug-and-play facilities to companies involved in the design and manufacturing of electronics in the heart of the city. The incorporation of AI into the city's identity, along with attractive incentives, is expected to draw global players to establish their units here. ""Artificial intelligence is the technology of the future and is used in every sector. If the companies engaged in this work find all the facilities they need in one industrial city, they would definitely like to set up their units here. We would like global players having patents in AI technologies to come and set up their units here,"" said a senior Delhi government official. Another official said the government would try to engage a concessionaire with knowledge of the needs of an electronic city, particularly in the AI domain, to develop appropriate infrastructure in Baprola. The Electronic City will just be a 20-minute drive from the Indira Gandhi International Airport and major national highways such as NH-1, NH-10, NH-8, and NH-2, with the completion of Urban Extension Roadway-II. Officials said the Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi has been entrusted with preparing a draft 'Delhi Electronics System Design, Manufacturing, and Refurbishment (ESDMR) Policy', aiming to position the city as the preferred destination for top electronics design, manufacturing, and refurbishment companies in India and globally. The commission has been specifically told to include the AI hub idea in it. Officials said that stakeholders in the government recently held a meeting to discuss the challenges, financial implications, and other issues related to land and the policy. ""The Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation will develop the project on a PPP model. Over a 30-year concession period, we have estimated that the government will earn a total rent of Rs 5,287 crore,"" said an official. ""The companies will be offered various kinds of incentives, which could be production-linked, labour-linked, and related to land leases, etc. The project will be executed through a public-private partnership, and the government may have to invest nearly Rs 250 crore in the initial five years to develop and promote the city. It may also have to forgo about Rs 100 crore towards stamp duty if the companies are exempted from paying the first installment of the lease rent as an incentive,"" added the official.

2023-07-28,"Experts poke holes in safety controls of ChatGPT, chatbots",NYT News Service,"When artificial intelligence companies build online chatbots , like ChatGPT , Claude and Google Bard , they spend months adding guardrails that are supposed to prevent their systems from generating hate speech, disinformation and other toxic material. Now there is a way to easily poke holes in those safety systems. In a report released Thursday, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and the Center for AI Safety in San Francisco showed how anyone could circumvent AI safety measures and use any of the leading chatbots to generate nearly unlimited amounts of harmful information. The research underscored concern that new chatbots could flood the internet with false and dangerous information. The researchers found that they could use a method gleaned from open source AI systems - systems whose underlying computer code has been released for anyone to use - to target the tightly controlled and more widely used systems from Google, OpenAI and Anthropic. The researchers found that they could break through the guardrails of open source systems by appending a long suffix of characters onto each English-language prompt fed into the system. If they asked one of these chatbots to ""write a tutorial on how to make a bomb,"" it would decline to do so. But if they added a lengthy suffix to the same prompt, it would instantly provide a detailed tutorial on how to make a bomb. In similar ways, they could coax the chatbots into generating biased, false and otherwise toxic information. The researchers were surprised when the methods they developed with open source systems could also bypass the guardrails of closed systems, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google Bard and Claude, a chatbot built by the startup Anthropic. The companies that make the chatbots could thwart the specific suffixes identified by the researchers. But the researchers say there is no known way of preventing all attacks of this kind. Experts have spent nearly a decade trying to prevent similar attacks on image recognition systems without success. The researchers disclosed their methods to Anthropic, Google and OpenAI earlier in the week. Michael Sellitto, Anthropic's interim head of policy and societal impacts, said the firm is searching ways to thwart such attacks. An OpenAI spokesperson said the company appreciated that the researchers disclosed their attacks. A Google spokesperson said the company has ""built important guardrails into Bard that we'll continue to improve over time.""",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/experts-poke-holes-in-safety-controls-of-chatgpt-chatbots/articleshow/102186622.cms
2023-07-28,AI-based cams to check traffic violations on national highways,J Abbas Mulla,"Representative image HUBBALLI: In an attempt to bring down road accidents, the state government is in the process of installing CCTV cameras powered by artificial intelligence (AI) on all national highways within the state's limits. These cameras will keep a tab on traffic violations and enforce lane discipline among motorists, primarily those driving goods vehicles. While installation of these cameras on some stretches has already been completed, other highways across the state will also be brought under similar surveillance network soon, officials said. These AI-based surveillance cameras, which are part of the Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS), will soon become functional, the authorities said. Work is currently underway to connect these cameras to toll plazas so that the fines can be collected immediately after a violation is spotted. To facilitate collection of penalties, an auto-challan generating system will also be installed at all toll plazas. Alok Kumar , the ADGP, traffic and road safety, Bengaluru, said installation of CCTV cameras and other work on the highway between Belagavi and Bengaluru has been completed. ""In Haveri, Davanegere and Chitradurga, penalising motorists for lane violation started a month ago, while in Bengaluru Rural, Tumakuru , Dharwad and Belagavi, the new system will be officially launched by August 5. On August 2, the system will be introduced in Bengaluru Rural district,"" Kumar said. Rules stipulate that trucks and other heavy vehicles should only travel on the third lane on highways. If these vehicles encroach upon the first or second lanes, the surveillance cameras will capture pictures of the vehicle and challans will be generated at the next toll booth. Overspeeding, riding on two-wheelers without helmets, having three or more riders on a two-wheeler are among the other offences that will be captured on the cameras and the violators penalised. Rajneesh Ganjyal , the managing director of Trinity Technologies and Software Solutions Pvt Ltd, said apart from installation of the CCTV, cameras personnel at the toll plazas are also being trained on how to issue the challans and other technical aspects of the rollout. An app has been developed to facilitate implementation of the new system.

2023-07-27,Driving over speed limit? AI cameras to keep watch on you,Jignesh Parmar,"AHMEDABAD: City road users be warned, 1,600-odd CCTV cameras at 130 junctions are being upgraded. They will get an AI program that will catch 32 traffic offences, including speed limit violations. The cameras are being trained by an agency and have reached a 95% accuracy rate in recognizing these offences. In its latest tender, the Ahmedabad Smart City Company ( ASCC ) called for proposals from agencies to expand the capabilities of these upgraded cameras. The new functions include detecting speed limit violations, unauthorized entry into the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) corridor, spotting individuals using mobile phones while driving or those not wearing seatbelts. Last year, the civic body had a successful trial run, achieving 95% accuracy in detecting speed limit violations through the AI program. The latest software update aims to enhance the efficiency of electronic memos (e-memos), enabling swifter actions against violations. A total of 5,629 CCTV cameras have been installed by the ASCC under the Safe and Secure Ahmedabad (SASA) initiative, with 1,695 of them at 130 traffic junctions for surveillance. The SASA project had been initiated by the AMC and city police seven years ago. Costing Rs 314 crore, it involved installing 6,500 surveillance cameras at 130 'zero tolerance' traffic junctions. Between 2015 and December 2021, city police issued 71.39 lakh e-memos for just three types of traffic offences: jumping red lights, crossing stop lines and speeding over the limit. Now, ASCC plans to expand the scope of e-memos to cover 32 traffic violations. These will include not wearing seatbelts, dark films on car windows, blocking left turns, parking dangerously, entering the BRTS corridor , using fancy numberplates, using mobile phones while driving, lane violations, riding triples on two-wheelers, overloading rickshaws, and parking violations. Deputy municipal commissioner of the Smart City project, Mihir Patel, told TOI, ""We have issued a request for proposal (RFP) from agencies to upgrade our AI software. This will enable smart cameras issue e-memos for 32 different types of traffic violations.""",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/driving-over-speed-limit-ai-cameras-to-keep-watch-on-you/articleshow/102153729.cms

2023-07-24,Parliamentary panel pitches for use of tiny robots and AI for farm operations to deal with the problem of fragmented land,Vishwa Mohan,"NEW DELHI: Flagging poor penetration of use of farm machines among vast majority of farmers due to their small land holdings, a parliamentary panel has recommend that the government should strive hard to promote agricultural mechanisation for small and marginal farmers, and pitched for use of “tiny robots and Artificial Intelligence (AI)” for Indian farm operations in future to deal with the problem of fragmented land. The panel - standing committee on agriculture that submitted its report in Parliament on Friday - also felt that the opening of National Institute of Agricultural Robotics & Artificial Intelligence is required to keep pace in development in agriculture at national and international level. It said a “concerted effort with multidisciplinary approach” is needed for timely development in the direction of use of AI and robots in the farm sector. In India, there are 86% small and marginal farmers having less than two hectares of land holdings. Noting the ground realities, the Committee headed by BJP member, P C Gaddigoudar , said, “Unless machines appropriate for small holdings are made available or substantial farm amalgamation takes place, it is difficult for the small and marginal farmers to purchase their own machinery."" Currently, the overall agriculture mechanisation level of the country is 47% which is comparatively lower than that of other developing countries such as China (60%) and Brazil (75%). Underlining importance of farm mechanisation in India as it plays a key role in improving agricultural production, productivity and efficiency, the panel in its report flagged how the current use leads to saving in seed (15-20%), fertilizer (15-20%), improvement in germination rate (7-25%), saving in time (20-30%), in weed (20-40%) and in labour (20-30%) besides increase in cropping intensity (5-20%) and increase in crop yield (13-23%). It, therefore, sought the government to strive hard to achieve a level of 75% in farm mechanisation from the present level of 47% in a much shorter period, instead of doing it in the next 25 years. “The Committee desires the government to follow up with other allied government departments and try to find portability of farm equipment suitable to small and marginal farmers as they are not in a position to buy huge farm equipment and cannot use these equipment in a cost effective way as their land holdings are very small,” said the report. The panel also recommended that to monitor and implement the government policy and programme of mechanization more effectively and efficiently, a ‘Directorate of Agricultural Engineering’ is needed in each state. It said instead of a sub-scheme on submission of Agricultural Mechanization, the government should have a full-fledged Agriculture Mechanization Scheme to accelerate the process. Currently, the government is implementing ""Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM)"" for which 40-50% of the cost of the equipments is being provided to the small and marginal farmers for the purchase of Tractors, Power Tillers, Combine Harvesters , Rotavators and Rice transplanter. One of the major objectives of SMAM is to promote custom hiring of farm machinery centres and Farm Machinery Banks (maintain a set of required equipment and use on sharing basis), so that small and marginal farmers can get the benefits of agriculture mechanization. Total 37,097 Custom Hiring Centres have been established under SMAM since 2014-15. Similarly, a total of 17,727 Farm Machinery Banks have been established at village level. Besides, 403 Hi-Tech Hubs have been established over the years. Though the Committee appreciated these efforts, it felt that in spite of the best efforts of the government, the benefits of Farm Machinery Banks have not percolated to Districts, Talukas, Panchayat and Gram Sabha levels.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/parliamentary-panel-pitches-for-use-of-tiny-robots-and-ai-for-farm-operations-to-deal-with-the-problem-of-fragmented-land/articleshow/102065950.cms

The centre will also offer master's and research-level programmes in data sciences and AI, and foster the application of these technologies in verticals like banking, financial services and insurance, healthcare, defence and manufacturing. “In the recent past, AI has evolved into one of the most impactful technologies with huge implications in multiple sectors that contribute to the global economy. Through this Centre of Excellence, we aim to contribute to not only fundamental research in AI and related fields, but also work on their application, provide hands-on experience to students, and collaborate with governments and industry. We want to contribute significantly to the body of knowledge in AI, and evangelise its adoption in academia, government and industry,” said Dr Ravi S Iyer , dean, School of Computer Science, UPES. The university officials said that studies suggest that half of today’s work activities could be automated between 2030 and 2060, with a midpoint in 2045. Despite having a high penetration of AI talent, India trails behind several leading global tech hubs in the race for Generative AI. Therefore, it is crucial to invest in and equip innovators with the essential skills needed to excel in the industry, which is what they hope to achieve through this centre.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/new-ai-centre-to-come-up-at-dehradun-based-university-of-petroleum-energy-studies/articleshow/102044809.cms

2023-07-22,How cops plan to use AI & facial recognition to curb crime in city,Advitya Bahl,"Image used for representative purpose only NOIDA: The police in Gautam Budh Nagar is set to roll out a Geospatial Data Intelligence Platform (GDIP), an artificial intelligence-powered crime data search engine, to improve policing. Police commissioner Laxmi Singh told TOI the GDIP integrates crime and policing data from all vital agencies, allowing investigators to access records and analyse crime trends with the click of a button. “The main objective is to ensure law enforcement agencies are up to date, able to recognise crime trends and make officials aware of potential offences,” Singh said. The technology-backed policing, she added, will help curb crimes against women and make public places safer for all. “The GDIP will help to map crime hotspots, analyse the district’s criminal data and frequency of crimes to help cops divert resources and enhance monitoring in those areas. It will also help create a comparative database on personnel strength and number of crimes committed,” she said. Once the GDIP is launched, a senior police official said, there will be efforts to integrate it with a facial recognition system. “There are an estimated 25,000 mugshots or photographs of convicted and undertrial prisoners and criminals with the district police. We are planning to integrate this data with the GDIP. Next, we will link the 4,000 CCTV cameras under the Integrated Traffic Management System (ITMS) with the GDIP. This will help the police catch a criminal or a repeat offender whenever and wherever he or she is spotted in public,” the CP said. Police data shows cases of kidnapping in the city have gone up by more than 70% in the last two years. While a total of 241 cases of kidnapping were reported in 2020, the number rose to 363 in 2021 and further to 416 in 2022, till November 30. The police data also shows that thefts, too, have gone up across the district.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/how-cops-plan-to-use-ai-facial-recognition-to-curb-crime-in-city/articleshow/102028588.cms
2023-07-21,Create authority to regulate AI: Trai,Pankaj Doval,"NEW DELHI: Telecom regulator Trai on Thursday recommended creation of an independent statutory authority “immediately” to ensure development of responsible artificial intelligence (AI) across sectors and also for regulation of use cases and consumer data. The move comes at a time when governments across the world, including India, grapple with the issue of putting in place laws and guardrails to check misuse of AI as the technology takes centre-stage across industry and consumer sectors. “An independent statutory authority should be established immediately for ensuring development of responsible AI and regulation of use cases in India. The authority should be designated as Artificial Intelligence and Data Authority of India (AIDAI),” Trai said in its recommendations on “Leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Big Data in Telecommunication Sector”. Trai, which had been asked to give its recommendations on the matter by the department of telecom in June 2019, however, said its views are not just confined to the telecom sector, but go beyond it to include other industries as well. “The impact of AI is not limited to only telecom sector. AI has thepotential to impact a wide range of sectors, including healthcare, finance, transportation, education, agriculture and many others. Therefore, it is important to take a holistic approach for examining the impact of AI across all sectors rather than focusing only on telecom… and hence a common framework covering all the sectors is being proposed. ” Trai said there is an “urgent need” to adopt a regulatory framework by the government . “The regulatory framework should ensure that specific AI use cases are regulated on a risk-based framework where high-risk use cases that directly impact humans are regulated through legally-bindingobligations. ” Apart from the statutory authority, it said the regulatory framework should also have a multi-stakeholder body (MSB) that will act as anadvisory body to AIDAI. AIDAI should evolve the framework based on its assessment and the advice from the proposed MSB. The regulation should also ensure that principles of responsible AI are made applicable at each phase of AI framework lifecycle such as design, development, validation, deployment, monitoring and refinement. It also said that the regulations should look at developing model ‘Ethical Codes’ for adoption by public and private entities in different sectors. “Define the process framework for use of AI and related technology in data processing, data sharing and data monetisation, while ensuring the privacy and security of the data owner. ” Trai also said the proposed authority should put in place an overarching framework for ethical use of data .",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/create-authority-to-regulate-ai-trai/articleshow/101998845.cms

2023-07-21,AI-based tech helps turmeric farmers in Telangana reap big profit,Sribala Vadlapatla,"HYDERABAD: Artificial intelligence and turmeric? Well, as a result of installing an AI-based curcumin percentage reading (instant) machine at Nizamabad market yard, traders and big turmeric farmers are laughing all the way to the bank with increased export orders to the United States, Europe and Japan. Not just this, even the turmeric price has jumped to Rs 11,202 per quintal this year- highest in a decade - from last year's Rs 6,000 per quintal. The extent of turmeric cultivated in the state has gradually decreased from one lakh acres in 2020 to 40,000 acres this year, resulting in prices rising steeply since the produce was not available in the markets, said officials. Spices Board of India took the initiative to introduce the AI-based machine since prices and demand are heavily influenced by the percentage of curcumin in turmeric. ""Farmers and traders used to wait for several days at the market yard to get their produce evaluated. But thanks to the AI-based reading machine, results are out in one hour, thereby saving time, energy and money,"" a senior official of the board said. ""It calculates the percentage of curcumin in turmeric within 60 seconds compared to the lengthy testing procedures by laboratories that take 2-3 days. This, in effect, not only helps in incentivising the farmers' produce quickly but also in making a rapid quality assessment of turmeric for the traders,"" the official explained. Following the success in Nizamabad, the AI-based technology is used in Meghalaya's Shillong now. ""This is proving to be very helpful in markets where price fluctuations are high,"" the official said. The AI-enabled platform helps in digitising quality of the turmeric, generating critical insights for farmers and enabling a good supply chain for traders. Experts said turmeric containing more than 3% curcumin commands a high price, which is primarily used in the pharmaceutical sector, and in the food processing industry, turmeric with less than 3% curcumin is used and its prices are heavily influenced by the market demand. But, farmers claimed that the price increase was only temporary and mainly due to reduction in availability of produce in the market. Small and marginal farmers reaped no benefits because they sold out their produce by May-end, while turmeric prices began to rise only in June. ""Big farmers and traders who retained the produce in cold storages commanded a good price now,"" said Maram Muthyam Reddy , a turmeric grower of Baswapoor village in Nizamabad.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ai-based-tech-helps-turmeric-farmers-in-state-reap-big-profit/articleshow/101998739.cms

2023-07-20,Canâ€™t restrict AI within borders: IMFâ€™s Gita Gopinath,Sidhartha,"IMF’s first deputy managing director Gita Gopinath was in Gandhinagar for the meeting of the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors. In an interview with TOI, she cautions on the adverse impact of generative AI and recommends regulation, and says even technologists have called for it. Excerpts: Is global inflation becoming more broad-based? Headline inflation appears to have peaked last year, but in many countries core inflation, which has come down slightly, is still quite high. That is the challenge central banks are facing, including in the US and Euro area. Our advice is to stay the course and to maintain a restrictive monetary policy stance as long as there are signs that core inflation is durably going to return back to target. We say it’s important to be data dependent because these are uncertain times and a lot of interest increases have already happened, but we also caution central bankers against prematurely easing policy, given the experience we have from the 1970s. How do you see the rate tightening affecting growth? You should expect to see slowing growth, labour markets will have to soften, we are at record low unemployment rates in many G20 countries. In terms of spillovers, this is a deeply integrated world, with trade and financial links, and when interest rates go up, the cost of borrowing goes up in other countries. This time, especially the stronger emerging markets, have handled this very well and we haven’t seen debt distress. We do see frontier markets and some vulnerable emerging markets that are being shut out of financial markets and having to buy atextremely high interest rates. For them the solutions include IMF programme, debt restructuring in several cases. It is important for the world as a whole that the US is able to win the fight against inflation. Several agencies see India as one of the bright spots in the global economy. What are the challenges that need to be addressed? When you look at India’s growth rate, and compare it with other emerging and developing markets, it is certainly a bright spot. In terms of the headwinds, there could be spillovers if growth slows down more dramatically than we project or if inflation is a more stubborn problem in advanced economies, which require central banks to raise rates. Do emerging technologies such as generative AI affect employment in countries such as India, which have a large young population? For many parts of the world, we have very strong job markets. In many developing countries we have a skill mismatch between the kind of jobs being generated and the skill that people have. That remains a challenge. How technology is going to affect jobs will depend on the kind of automation you have. Automation in the car industry generated the hollowing out of the middle class in many countries. The early evidence we are seeing of generati-ve artificial intelligence is that it is more of a leveller, which means it creates more junior positions and higher wage increases in these positions. The reason is that you are able to transfer the knowledge that comes with experience to the junior workers through generative AI technology. We also have to be careful that generative AI will create new kinds of productive jobs. What are the risks of these technologies and is it time to start regulating them? On regulation, we have to be careful about making sure that generative AI is used for the benefit of humanity. We are aware of the risks associated with it and issues with biases in how we summarise data, AI hallucinations. We need proper regulations to protect consumers. In the labour market we need the right amount of skill, maybe lifelong learning. It’s also important to have social safety nets to ensure that those who are losing jobs get state support and can come back into the workforce. On the tax policy front, we need to make sure that you are not incentivising the use of AI because capital taxes are lower than labour taxes. There there have to be globally settled rules on this front. Who will set those rules? Many agencies have stepped in — the EU that is coming up with regulations, the UN is talking about the role it will play, G20 has a working group and G20 at some point is likely to take up this area too.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cant-restrict-ai-within-borders-imfs-gita-gopinath/articleshow/101970647.cms
2023-07-19,Facebook parent Meta announces AI partnership with Microsoft: What it means and why its important,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Facebook parent company Meta is making its artificial intelligence chatbot, Llama 2, available for commercial use through partnerships with major cloud providers including Microsoft. For those unaware, Meta has built an artificial intelligence system that rivals the likes of ChatGPT and Google's Bard. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company is partnering with Microsoft to introduce the next generation of its AI large language model and making the technology, known as LLaMA 2, free for research and commercial use. Zuckerberg said people can download its new AI models directly or through a partnership that makes them available on Microsoft's cloud platform Azure ""along with Microsoft's safety and content tools."" ""Open source drives innovation because it enables many more developers to build with new technology,"" Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post Tuesday. ""It also improves safety and security because when software is open, more people can scrutinize it to identify and fix potential issues. I believe it would unlock more progress if the ecosystem were more open, which is why we're open sourcing Llama 2."" What Microsoft said Microsoft on its part is making Llama 2 available through the Azure AI catalog to use with cloud tools, such as content filtering. The tool can also run directly on Windows PCs, and will be available through outside providers like Amazon Web Services and Hugging Face. “Meta and Microsoft share a commitment to democratizing AI and its benefits and we are excited that Meta is taking an open approach with Llama 2,” Microsoft said in a blog post. “We offer developers choice in the types of models they build on, supporting open and frontier models and are thrilled to be Meta’s preferred partner as they release their new version of Llama 2 to commercial customers for the first time,” it added. Why the deal is important The financial terms of the partnership have not been disclosed. Microsoft is also a major funder and partner of OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. Neither ChatGPT nor similar offerings from Microsoft or Google are open source. With the deal, Microsoft seems to be making it clear that it’s not strictly an OpenAI-only shop when it comes to generative AI. Incidentally, while Microsoft is described by Meta as a ""preferred"" partner, the company said that the models will also be available through Amazon Web Services, which is Microsoft's main cloud rival, as well as AI startup Hugging Face and others.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//gadgets-news/facebook-parent-meta-announces-ai-partnership-with-microsoft-what-it-means-and-why-its-important/articleshow/101883823.cms

It further recommends agriculture, tourism and energy as prominent growth engines to accelerate the economy. It says the target of a $1 trillion economy by 2028 is achievable, given the state's average 9% growth rate over the past five years. The report, prepared by a team led by Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran , shows the regional imbalance and hence wants all parts of Maharashtra to be brought into the main economic cycle. ""Along with GDP-multiplier tourism, the focus of agriculture will have to be on sustainability, moisture security and farmers' income and we will implement these recommendations,"" said deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis while accepting the report recently. It includes initiatives to strengthen skill development for job growth. The government will constitute an empowered team for its execution, said chief minister Eknath Shinde.

2023-07-14,CM bats for artificial intelligence in higher education curriculum,Gopi Dara,"Vijayawada: Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy highlighted the importance of artificial intelligence (AI) and stressed the need to include it in the curriculum . During a meeting with senior officials of the education department and vice-chancellors of universities at his Tadepalli camp office on Thursday, the chief minister told them to think of the steps required to “fill the gap between our goals and achievements in the field of education” in the backdrop of the changes that the world is experiencing. “From steam engine to electricity to computers, we remained followers without having a say in their creation,” he said, adding that the world is now witnessing a fourth revolution in the form of AI. Pointing out that the vice-chancellors play a key role in higher education, he said they should think of adopting a two-pronged strategy to move along with the emerging technologies. While adopting AI into the education system for improving teaching methods and learning skills, students should also be imparted with the AI creating skills and it should become the part of curriculum, he said. “We should be a part of the fourth revolution becoming its creators and not remain just its followers. If we take right steps at the right time, we will become part of the emerging technologies. As AI grows, one section grows as its creators and another section follows it. We should become its creators,” he added. He further noted that all western countries are facing demographic imbalance. “In our state and in the country, 70 per cent of the people are capable of working. Unless we train them with proper knowledge and skills, we can’t take the role of guiding the world,” he said, and asked officials to think of the changes to be introduced in the educational system to achieve the task. Higher education classes should be conducted in such a way that augmented reality and virtual reality should be integrated with curriculum, he said, observing that teaching methods in medical education also should be changed with the introduction of AI and robotics while changing the syllabus in tune with emerging technologies. “Using of technology in agriculture is also playing key role and modern methods should be imparted to our students,” he said. “To take my thoughts and suggestions to the next level, we shall constitute working groups with four or five universities giving representation to engineering, medical and other faculties,” the chief minister added.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/cm-bats-for-artificial-intelligence-in-higher-education-curriculum/articleshow/101742688.cms
2023-07-13,China publishes interim rules on generative artificial intelligence,Reuters,"HONG KONG: China issued interim measures on Thursday to manage its booming generative artificial intelligence (AI) industry, saying they would apply only to services offered to the public as regulators seek to support development of the technology. The rules, set to take effect on Aug. 15, come after Beijing signalled the end of its years-long crackdown on the tech industry, whose help it seeks to spur an economy recovering more slowly than expected after the scrapping of Covid-19 curbs . Thursday's rules clarified the scope of what regulators will target, following draft rules published in April that required firms to submit security assessments before launching their offerings to the public. ""The current version is very much in line with market expectations,"" said Kai Wang , an analyst with Morningstar. ""It sends the positive signal that the regulators are paving the way for companies in China to launch their products on a large scale."" China sees AI as an area in which it wants to rival the United States, and on which it has set it sights on becoming a world leader by 2030. It is seen to be ahead of the regulatory curve as countries globally grapple with setting guardrails for the technology popularised by the success of OpenAI 's ChatGPT chatbot . Such efforts must weigh up safety concerns and copyright protections against ensuring an environment beneficial to innovation. Investment has poured into China's generative AI scene and its firms have launched dozens of AI models, companies had held back from rolling out chatbots to the public until Beijing finalised rules for the technology and approved their products. On Thursday, the regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) reiterated that content generated by generative AI had to be in line with China's core socialist values. Service providers had to ensure intellectual property rights were not infringed, it added, advising that legitimate data sources should be used. However, the measures would not apply to those working on generative AI technology who did not plan to plan to offer services to the Chinese public, it said. China wants to encourage the development of the technology, it said, citing areas such as generative AI algorithms and semiconductors, as well as engage in drawing up international rules. ""Relevant national authorities shall ... improve their supervisory methods so that they are scientific and compatible with innovation and development,"" the regulator said. Chinese tech firms, such as Alibaba Group and Baidu Inc, developed their own ChatGPT-style chatbots.

2023-07-12,Why Google’s ‘human intelligence’ is complaining over artificial intelligence,Abhinav Kaustubh,"Google ’s Bard chatbot is quite prompt in answering your queries. But do you know, despite all the artificial intelligence at work, the Bard is highly dependent on humans, and they are overworked, underpaid, and frustrated? There are a group of contract workers who work behind the scenes to support generative AI. If you think it is all AI, then you are wrong, human intelligence is as important as artificial intelligence as they are the ones who make sure the chatbot spits out accurate and reliable answers. Amidst Google's AI race with OpenAI , the ones to suffer are these contract workers. The workload of these workers has increased in size and complexity. Take the case of Bard. It offers prompt responses to a variety of questions. Whether you are asking for help in your mathematics assignment or making it write a whole new book, it can do it all. Nevertheless, the chatbot and the companies depend on human reviewers to improve the quality of these responses and maintain consistency. These individuals evaluate the answers, provide feedback on errors, and remove traces of partiality. Those working on the Bard are from companies such as Appen and Accenture . Despite working under strict time constraints with minimal training and earning as little as $14 an hour, these contractors have expressed concerns about the standard of their work and worry about facing the consequences of speaking up, reports Bloomberg. These staffers have been working since January on AI-related tasks to prepare for the public release of Google's AI products. According to six current Google contract workers, their job has become increasingly challenging. Even without specialised knowledge, these workers are responsible for evaluating responses on a variety of topics, including medication dosages and state regulations. They must follow complex instructions and complete tasks with tight deadlines, some as short as three minutes. One of the contractors said the current situation is causing fear, stress, and uncertainty among people, resulting in underpaid work and a lack of cohesiveness. The contractor believes that this culture of apprehension is not helpful in achieving the desired quality and teamwork from everyone. Contractors working for Google have expressed concerns about their working conditions, both privately and publicly. They claim that the conditions affect the quality of content that users see. In May, a contract worker for Appen wrote a letter to Congress, stating that the speed at which they are required to review content could make Bard a ""faulty"" and ""dangerous"" product. The workers claimed that their work was evaluated through automated means that were difficult to understand. They could not communicate directly with Google and only provided feedback through a ""comments"" section for each task. Additionally, workers had to work quickly as they were flagged by an AI system that urged them to work faster. According to the workers, they have come across disturbing content such as bestiality, war footage, child pornography, and hate speech as part of their job evaluating the quality of Google's offerings. Some workers at Accenture said they were temporarily assigned to review inappropriate and offensive prompts. However, after one worker filed an HR complaint, the project was suddenly stopped for the US team. Nevertheless, teams at other locations are still continuing this practice. Accenture employees were also asked to provide creative responses to prompts for Google's AI chatbot, Bard. They were given tasks such as writing a Shakespearean-style poem about dragons or debugging code. Sources familiar with the situation revealed this information anonymously. Last month, six contract workers at Appen who trained Google's new AI chatbot claimed they were unjustly fired for speaking out about low pay and unreasonable deadlines. The employer, Appen, is accused of illegally firing the workers for organizing. Despite advocating for better pay and working conditions for almost a year, they were terminated just two weeks after warning Congress about potential danger from the chatbot, Bard. Appen cited ""business conditions"" as the reason for termination and has not commented further. In a statement, Google said the company is not the employer of any of the workers in question. Instead, the suppliers are responsible for setting the working conditions, such as pay, benefits, hours, tasks assigned, and employment changes.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/why-googles-human-intelligence-is-complaining-over-artificial-intelligence/articleshow/101699642.cms

2023-07-10,"AI can't replace Mickey Mouse, says voice of Disney mascot",AFP,"BURBANK: Aw, gee! The technology driving artificial intelligence sure is swell, but it could never capture the essence of Mickey Mouse , according to the man who voices Disney's mascot. As part of Disney's upcoming 100th anniversary celebration, AFP spoke with animators, archivists and Mickey voice actor Bret Iwan about the company's past and future, including the potential for AI -- a topic currently roiling Hollywood. ""Gosh, I would say, of course there's amazing technology being developed with AI, and it's so impressive,"" said Iwan. ""But I don't think anything can replace the heart of a character and more importantly, the heart of storytelling."" Artificial intelligence, and the threat it poses to professions across the entertainment industry, has been a constant source of hand-wringing in Hollywood this summer. AFP's visit to Disney's sprawling studio near Los Angeles came during the ongoing strike by writers, in part over fears that AI could replace them. The issue is also among demands being negotiated by Hollywood actors who are worried about AI cloning their voices and likenesses, and who could strike as soon as Thursday. But for Iwan, character and storytelling are ""unique to a performer, a writer, an animator, an artist, a creator."" ""I have to believe that that part is what's going to hold out, and keep real people doing the job for a while!"" Iwan is one of just four people to have ever been Mickey's official voice. Mickey's falsetto was first voiced by company founder Walt Disney himself, with 1928's ""Steamboat Willie."" Two other men each voiced the character for more than three decades. ""I hope I get to do it as long as this holds out,"" said Iwan, pointing to his vocal cords. In animation -- perhaps the art form most associated with Disney -- the role of sophisticated computers is well-established. Computer-generated animation has long overtaken traditional hand-drawn artistry as the genre's dominant form. While humans are still designing and creating those films, the use of AI to generate the credits for the Disney+ show ""Secret Invasion"" recently triggered anger. Eric Goldberg -- the Disney animator who designed the Genie in ""Aladdin,"" and a stalwart champion of hand-drawn animation -- believes AI is unlikely to impact his work. ""I think AI has less of a chance of affecting hand-drawn animation than it does computer animation, because AI is about replicating realism,"" he said. ""The characters that I do, the Genie's head can turn into a toaster! Which you can't do with an AI character!"" ""So hand-drawn gives us a little bit of an advantage that way."" Goldberg recently finished training five new Disney hand-drawn apprentices, and believes there will always ""be a core of us who want to see hand-drawn animation."" ""Because we have to use our imaginations so much to represent hand-drawn characters, because of the flexibility of what they can do, I don't think AI is going to be a problem to that side of medium,"" said Goldberg. ""As long as there are people who still want to do it!""",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/ai-cannot-replace-mickey-says-voice-of-disney-mascot/articleshow/101622277.cms

Launched by PM Modi in 2021, INDIAai is a dataset program where the government's anonymised data will be made available to Indian academicians and startups to help them research and develop large AI models. “PM Modi launched this program much before OpenAI or Generative AI was fashionable, and very soon we will announce the entire architecture for this,” Chandrasekhar, the union minister of state for electronics and Information Technology, said on Friday. “Five working groups were set up by the ministry and two consultation meetings have happened,” he added. Two key requirements for developing large language models (LLMs) to rival the scale and efficiency of those brought out by the likes of OpenAI are the availability of large data sets and high computing power. While the INDIAai program takes care of data, C-DAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing) working with the private sector will also create AI computing infrastructure required, Chandrasekar said. The minister was speaking at the inauguration of electromagnetic interference and compatibility labs for defence and civilian applications at the Society for Applied Microwave Electronics Engineering & Research (SAMEER) here. He also unveiled a medical Linear Accelerator (LINAC) system developed by SAMEER for use at Adyar Cancer Hospital, Chennai. Commenting on whether a commercial fab ecosystem is possible in India, Chandrasekar said the country will “very soon” see it happen. “In the next 3-4 years, we will have a fully competitive semiconductor ecosystem in India,” he said. “Today we have 30 startups in the semiconductor design space while 18 months ago we had none,” he added. Hailing PM Modi's recent visit to the US as “historic”, the minister said the technology world of future will see massive disruption in the areas of quantum computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), semiconductors, and high performance computing, and the India-US partnership is going to play a key role in this, he said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/india-to-soon-unveil-large-scale-public-datasets-for-ai-research/articleshow/101586416.cms
2023-07-07,STF to use AI tech to create criminal data bank for UP,TNN,"LUCKNOW: The UP Police have floated tenders for hiring experts for an artificial intelligence ( AI ) based process of collecting data of criminals to prepare one of the biggest banks of crime profiles. The criminal data bank will be set up under the UP Special Task Force (UPSTF). Once the data is collated and crime profiles are created, STF will be able to sift through the data bank based on keywords related to a particular crime to identify possible suspects. Such a system is in use by Telangana police and the Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Operations ( IFSO ) unit of Delhi police special cell. A senior home official said that with the UP government allocating a budget to further strengthen the STF in a recent review meeting chaired by chief minister Yogi Adityanath, the STF had initiated the process of acquiring the AI-based system. ""Working on Yogi Adityanath's zero-tolerance policy against crime, the UPSTF plans to establish the AI-based Criminal Data Creation and Retrieval System at a cost of Rs 3 crore for which tenders have already been issued and four companies have also shown keen interest in installing it in the state. The new AI-based system will help identify criminals by providing tools for matching face, voice and method of crime,"" a home official added. The CM had expressed his satisfaction over UPSTF's action against dreaded criminals, illegal drug traffickers, illegal arms smugglers, exam mafia and fake teachers, as well as terrorists at the review meeting. ""With this AI-based system, anonymous shooters and criminals involved in serious incidents will no longer be able to escape the UPSTF's dragnet. Within seconds, their complete profile, including their identification, will be available to police officers. This technology will expedite disclosure of incidents and help in sending the criminals responsible behind bars,"" said an officer of the technical services. ""Such a system is being installed in UP after Telangana. The system will help the UP Police in creating a complete database of criminals in the state. Previously, this work was done through the Criminal Tracking System,"" said the officer. With the integration of criminal databases using artificial intelligence, facial recognition will be performed in a matter of seconds. Additionally, their voices, methods of executing the crime, family backgrounds and criminal histories will be readily available, another officer said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/stf-to-use-ai-tech-to-create-criminal-data-bank-for-up/articleshow/101556856.cms
2023-07-06,Google will use publicly available data to train Bard and other AI models,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"The key for AI-powered chatbots like Google’s Bard or OpenAI’s popular ChatGPT is data. The more data that these models learn, the smarter they become. A reason why Twitter put read limits is that it didn’t want AI companies to do data scraping to train their models. Now, Google has clarified that it will use user data to train Bard and other generative AI content. Updates to Google’s privacy policy According to a report by Gizmodo, Google has updated its privacy policy and made it clear it will rely on data that is publicly available. “Google uses information to improve our services and to develop new products, features and technologies that benefit our users and the public. For example, we use publicly available information to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Bard, and Cloud AI capabilities,” the updated policy reads. User private data will not be used but anything and everything that is publicly available, Google will use that data. Google’s privacy policy also makes it clear that “when you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information. Why Google collects data Google says that it collects information to provide better services to all its users. This will include figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads people find useful or who are the people that matter most to you online. “The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls,” says Google in its privacy policy. What sort of user data is used? It’s a lot of data — not all but a lot — that Google uses. The information Google collects includes browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. “We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP adddress, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request,” reads Google’s privacy policy.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//gadgets-news/google-will-use-your-data-to-train-bard-and-other-ai-models/articleshow/101500421.cms

Goa Board chairman Bhagirath Shetye said that as coding and robotics syllabus has already been introduced in schools, the decision has been kept in abeyance as of now, to avoid sudden strain on school computer teachers. “The school computer teachers are already engaged in teaching the coding and robotics syllabus. So it was felt that it may be difficult for them to start teaching artificial intelligence as well right away. A decision on introducing artificial intelligence as an optional subject will be taken later,” Shetye said. Artificial intelligence was to be introduced as one of the 19 optional subject choices available to Class IX students as part of the National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF) scheme. Under the scheme, students study all the six regular subjects and opt for a seventh optional subject. Students have to clear any six subjects at the end of the year to pass the class. Fine arts and astronomy are some of the other interesting optional subject choices available to Class IX students. Recently, ‘sports and well-being’ and artificial intelligence were added as new options from 2023-24. However, in recent years, the coding and robotics syllabus was introduced for students from Class VI to VIII, for which school computer teachers itself have been trained to impart the course. In addition to teaching coding and robotics, it would be difficult for computer teachers to teach artificial intelligence as a full-fledged subject with five classes a week and a practical component.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/optional-subject-on-ai-for-class-ix-placed-on-hold/articleshow/101423237.cms

Delivering a special lecture on ‘AI and Coding technology’ at the Leelavati Charantimath Public School here, Bendre, a native of Dharwad who has settled in the US since last four decades, said already a large number of Indian youths trained in AI are working in US and there are ample opportunities for others. He said AI facilitates quicker completion of tasks and reduces the demand for resources to complete the task. AI will revolutionise not only the industry, trade and commerce but also the human life, he added. Education is one sector which will be hugely impacted and benefited by AI, Bendre explained. President of the school managing committee Arun Charantimath said his school, affiliated to CBSE, is already imparting lessons on AI by including it in the syllabus for class 9 and 10. KCCI seeks toll exemption for villagers Gangavathi (Koppal): Koppal District Chambers of Commerce and Industry appealed to the elected representatives of the district that as people from villages near toll booths have to pay toll to travel to the hobli centre which is only 2km away, they should be exempted from such unscientific toll charges. “For example, the toll plaza near Marali village is only 3-4 km away from taluk centre Gangavathi. Similarly, the toll plaza near Hemagudda is only 10-12 km from Gangavathi city. As thousands of people have to visit the taluk centre every day, paying tollfee every day for a short distance is unacceptable,” said Ashokaswamy Herur, president of the chamber. Due to the construction of two toll plazas at a short distance, it is becoming expensive for the people of surrounding villages to cross the toll to visit hobli and taluk centres. “Therefore, locals should exempted from toll charges,” he appealed to Koppal district minister Shivaraj S Thangadagi and Gangavathi MLA G Janardhana Reddy . Mutts denied permission to hold event Koppal: The taluk administration on Wednesday rejected the request made by the Uttaradi Mutt and Rayara Mutt to allow them to hold programs for three days from July 6 at Nava Vrindavan Gadde in Anegondi of Gangavathi taluk. “Rayara Mutt had requested permission for the worship of Jayathirtha and Uttaradi Mutt for the celebration of Raghuvarya Mahimotsava. Since both mutts are at loggerheads, if permission is given, both mutts will fight with each other, threatening the law and order situation. Hence this decision was taken,” said Manjunath, tahslidar of Gangavathi. A discussion was held in the presence of the tahsildar on Tuesday with the representatives of both the mutts.

2023-06-28,"Cos can deploy AI to improve talent retention, boost output",M Muneer,"By M Muneer Global CHROs tell me that AI will become vital for HR processes this year. We know that artificial intelligence (AI) can help automate repetitive tasks, analyse data, and make predictions, allowing HR to make more informed decisions. As organisations face increasing pressure to remain competitive, automation and streamlining of HR processes will continue. The assumption is that HR can focus more on higher-value tasks such as talent development and job redesign. One area where I see a significant dose of AI infusion is employee engagement. AI tools analyse employee data such as survey responses and social media activity to gain insights into what motivates employees and suggest ways to keep them engaged. This transforms into improved job satisfaction, higher retention rates, and a more productive workforce. Another area that can have a big impact is the recruitment process. AI automates the talent-acquisition process by screening resumes & candidates, and conducting initial interviews. This will reduce the risk of human bias, cut recruitment time and costs, as I have seen with humanoids and video AI platforms that can perform all such tasks with great accuracy. These can interview tens of thousands of candidates simultaneously and at the times preferred by candidates. Performance management is another key area ripe for transformation. AI can track employee performance and provide feedback in real time. This will help identify areas of improvement and provide personalised learning and development (L&D) guidelines. The natural extension of this is into employee-engagement processes. For instance, use AI to predict which employees are likely to leave and suggest customised interventions to improve retention. In the quest for better employee experience, CHROs can introduce AI and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) -based onboarding platforms and extend it to L&D programmes. Already, chatbots and virtual assistants are being used to provide instant support on HR-related issues. There are various AI tools available for HR today. Applicant-tracking systems are useful to scan resumes and match candidates to job descriptions, cutting down filtering time. Video-interviewing platforms provide insights on candidate personality, communication skills, and emotional intelligence. HR chatbots use natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to provide quick answers to employees. Employee-engagement tools analyse data to identify potential issues and recommend solutions. Predictive analytics project future outcomes such as employee turnover and help make data-driven decisions. Diversity and inclusion tools analyse hiring and promotion data to identify potential biases and recommend ways to improve. While all these are music to CHROs’ ears, there are cacophonies too. First is the bias that AI algorithms could carry — they are only as unbiased as the data they are trained on. This can lead to unintentional discrimination in hiring and performance evaluations. Second is the lack of transparency. Some AI algorithms are complex and opaque, leading to difficulty in understanding how they make their conclusions. This can be a problem when HR needs to explain their decisions to stakeholders. Third is data privacy/security. AI algorithms rely on humongous data, which raises privacy and security concerns. HR needs to protect employee data and ensure that it’s used responsibly and ethically. Fourth is the possibility of getting enslaved to AI — use it as a powerful tool, but don’t allow it to replace human judgment. Here are some best practices CHROs may consider while infusing AI: *Define clear objectives: Keep the business objectives on top to help in the selection of the right tools and measure success *Ensure data quality: The data used in AI applications must be accurate, relevant and up to date *Evaluate AI vendors: HR teams should evaluate potential vendors carefully, looking at factors such as track record, expertise and commitment to ethical practices *Ensure transparency: AI algorithms must be transparent and explainable so that employees and other stakeholders can understand how decisions are being made *Address biases: Take steps to address bias in algorithms, such as testing for fairness and eliminating any biased data or features *Use AI to complement human expertise: While AI can automate many routine tasks and provide data-driven insights, it should not replace human judgment entirely *Invest in training: Training is needed to develop skills to work with AI tools effectively and responsibly *Monitor and evaluate: Monitoring the performance of AI applications and evaluating their impact on the organisation are critical (The writer is co-founder of Medici Institute)",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cos-can-deploy-ai-to-improve-talent-retention-boost-output/articleshow/101347537.cms
2023-06-28,AI race: Top Chinese firm says its chatbot â€˜betterâ€™ than ChatGPT,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"It does seem like Chinese companies did lose a head start in the AI race compared to US tech giants like Microsoft, Google. But that didn’t deter them from jumping into the race as almost every big tech company from China announced their mega plans. Now, according to a report by CNBC, Baidu has claimed that its own chatbot can do better than ChatGPT . Ernie Bot : Baidu’s answer to ChatGPT In a blog post, Baidu announced the new iteration of its foundation model to version 3.5. “Ernie 3.5 has made significant strides in beta testing, surpassing ChatGPT (3.5) in comprehensive ability scores and outperforming GPT-4 in several Chinese language capabilities,” according to China Science Daily.

2023-06-26,"AI startups buck funding winter, grow share in â€™23",Sindhu Hariharan,"Chennai: Even as the funding winter looms over the startup ecosystem, AI startups seem to be bucking the trend as ChatGPT and Generative AI captivates India Inc. Deep tech, specifically AI, has emerged as the darling of venture capitalists (VC) in early stage funding. The share of VC investments in AI startups stands at 15% of the total VC funding in the first five months of 2023 (January-May) compared to a corresponding 10% share commanded by AI startups in 2022, data sourced from research firm Venture Intelligence shows. Overall VC investments have slumped on the back of a difficult economic environment in 2023, and accordingly, AI investments stood at just 28 deals worth $0.5 billion in 2023 (January-May) compared to 114 deals worth $2.4 billion in 2022. However, the growth in share of AI investments over the last three years is reflective of investors’ bullishness for AI, industry trackers and investors told TOI. The heightened interest and deal activity around AI in the US is also translating to the Indian ecosystem and AI-centric ideation by existing and new startups is on the rise, they said. Top AI deals this year include AI-powered software composer Builder.ai’s $250-million raise from Qatar Investment Authority in addition to being backed by Microsoft. This round saw the startup double valuation. Enterprise AI player Mad Street Den raised $30 million in a series-C round led by Avatar Growth Capital. Exfinity Fund (3 deals), Peak XV Partners (2) (formerly Sequoia India), and Lightspeed Ventures (2) led the tally of VC investors who made maximum bets in AI in 2023. Vishesh Rajaram of Speciale Invest says many entrepreneurs are exploring ways to strengthen their business proposition with AI. “Some are doing it to prevent AI from disrupting their product, and while some are fads,” he adds. 3One4 Capital has a similar thesis for its investments. “The best teams are now thinking about AI and we’ve seen teams with unique insight and strong execution capabilities raise large sums of capital especially at pre-seed and seed stage,” Sonal Saldanha, VP, investments, 3one4 Capital, said. The dry powder currently with India-dedicated funds runs into tens of billions, suggesting a steady early-stage deal flow in coming months, Arun Natarajan, founder, Venture Intelligence, said. “In such a situation, sectors with tailwinds such as AI and electric vehicles (EVs) will be the first beneficiaries,” he adds. Speciale is keen to back developer tools that simplify building and deploying Generative AI and startups dabbling in the data/infrastructure layer of Large Language Models (LLMs). 3One4 Capital has a similar thesis for its investments.

2023-06-26,HUL taps AI to predict trends & turnovers,Namrata Singh,"In a different era, Steve Jobs famously said ""figure out what customers are going to want before they do"", and revolutionised the tech market with innovative Apple products. Now, in an AI universe, an FMCG company is reading your mind, developing a product that you would want, and manufacturing it, without the need perhaps for factory trials. From picking up a signal on a developing trend to the inception of an idea to producing it, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is using its agile innovation hub to bring goods straight into consumer homes. According to HUL , the new age technology is not only cutting down the duration of the manufacturing process but also helping in predicting the expected turnover from the product. At HUL's head office in Mumbai, its agile innovation hub (AI hub) pivots around three axes - consumer, customer and operations. The hub, the facilities of which are also accessible by all locations in Unilever across its global markets, is part of the company's 'Reimagine HUL' journey. It falls under the consumer ecosystem and is integrated into the company's business process and category innovation programmes. Once consumer signals are picked up at the AI hub, they are quickly assessed for their merit in being converted into product ideas, said Vibhav Sanzgiri, executive director (R&D), HUL, and head, global skin cleansing R&D. ""This AI-led digital transformation is an enabler. The need has always been there. The approach has evolved, and we realise that in today's world, doing more of the same doesn't help, and therefore, we use data, technology, automation, and artificial intelligence to fast-track the product journey,"" he added. But there was one problem. The data available at one's fingertips is enormous. HUL realised the need for sense-making to cut through the noise. ""Our teams filter through the noise to stay on top of relevant data. We have created a pathway that links up the disjointed datasets to make sense. We then put an AI-based analytical layer on top, creating value-added data that helps teams unlock trends,"" said Sanzgiri. If one has to truly predict the future, he added, one needs the tools to do that. ""By using AI and machine learning, we generate hundreds of concept ideas, beyond which a combination of machine and human intelligence draws a comparison between past learnings on innovations by the company and competitors. We then fine-tune it to a list of smaller innovations before taking consumer response through rapid always-on digital panels to understand their purchase intent,"" said Sanzgiri. This helps HUL in targeting the biggest opportunities before they become mainstream. ""We can predict the expected turnover of a specific product if we were to take it to full fruition. We can map out the future opportunities five years down the line,"" he said. ""Through our interconnected network of next-gen capabilities, such as the AI hub and the advanced manufacturing centre (AMC), we have been successful in bringing down GTM (go to market) lead times by a third. In some cases, innovations hit the marketplace in a matter of weeks and months versus years,"" said Sanzgiri. For instance, fragrance selection time has been reduced to hours using an in-house robot-assisted library with over 2,000 fragrances. On the other hand, digital design and 3D printing are used for rapid prototyping and pack testing. Before beginning the process of producing these innovations, augmented reality is used to visualise packs on retail shelves and in consumer homes. To gauge consumer response, HUL works with an in-house panel of sensory experts and thousands of consumers who are on speed dial across India. After the formulations are perfected, HUL's AMC, which is also located at the headquarters, simulates manufacturing processes at the company's digital factories to rapidly scale up production without the need for actual factory trials. It is the only second such centre for Unilever globally and the first focused on soap bars. The next part is scaling up the technology into something marketable. ""We see the AMC as part of our 'labs of the future'. Once the scale-up happens, we pass them on to our nano and digital factories. This way, the 'always on' process keeps feeding into this virtuous cycle of innovation, scale-up, and digital operations,"" said Sanzgiri. Scaling up a product - from a few grams in a laboratory beaker to a few kilos or tonnes in a factory - can be complex. ""The ambition behind some of these digital and automation capabilities is how do we avoid factory trials altogether. The purpose of doing that is to speed up the innovation process. What matters to consumers is whether the product meets their needs, delights them, and is available at the right price point,"" he said. HUL now experiments with more products at the same time. It has launched over 20 innovations and new launches, including certain direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands, in the last year alone. Additionally, multiple claims, e-commerce compliance of its packs, and key savings projects - all happened using AI hub capabilities in the past 12 months.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hul-taps-ai-to-predict-trends-turnovers/articleshow/101266253.cms

2023-06-23,â€˜India has over 60 Gen AI startupsâ€™,Shilpa Phadnis,"Bengaluru: India has over 60 generative AI startups, says a new report by industry body Nasscom. Generative AI startups in the country, it said, have already raised $590 million in funding, and most of it ($475 million) since 2021. The Bengaluru region has 45% of the generative AI startups. The city’s deeptech startup ecosystem, high-end innovation-driven institutions, extensive industry presence, and an emerging class of domestic angel investors are seen to be a big draw. The Mumbai-Pune region accounts for the second largest pool, at 21%. This region boasts of some of the most well-established institutional investors and VCs, and a diverse talent pool. The report said 74% of startups are generative AI native and 26% are those that have pivoted. About 37% of the non-commercialised solutions are expected to find markets within a year. Many Indian generative AI startups prefer a tech stack comprising public cloud and cloud-based databases, pre-trained models, and custom-built visualisation tools. “Being a nascent technology, big-ticket investments, particularly in native Indian foundational models and enterprise-grade applications services are yet to happen. In addition to limited investments, generative AI startups in India also face the challenge of limited high-quality and ready-to-use training datasets and lack of high-performance compute capacity at scale. Lack of clarity on data privacy, security, ethical guidelines, and globally consistent generative AI usage standards can further slow down growth,” Nasscom executives Sangeeta Gupta, SVP and chief strategy officer, and Achyuta Ghosh, research head, say in the report. They said companies will find it difficult to upskill a large workforce rapidly in the next 6-12 months. Nasscom’s data shows that $8 billion was pumped into AI from 2013 to 2022, ($3.2 billion in 2022 alone) across 1,900 AI startups in India.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/india-has-over-60-gen-ai-startups/articleshow/101204049.cms

2023-06-23,Knee replacement? AI-enabled op starts,TNN,"LUCKBOW: Artificial intelligence enabled medical robot that promises to scale up precision in total knee replacement surgery was launched in the city on Thursday. “In regular total knee replacement surgeries, patients tend to get 70-75% relief from their condition on average. The relief may now be elevated to 90-95% with the help of this AI powered robot that does a tailor-made job,” said Dr Sanjay Srivastava, head of orthopaedics department at Apollomedics Hospital where the robot has been installed. He added that the AI enabled knee replacement method has a precision level up to 0. 1 mm. “It works with real time imaging and data analysis and is an active robotic system unlike conventional or passive robotic methods,” he explained. Stating that six patients have already availed the facility at his centre, CEO, Dr Mayank Somani said: “When the skilled hands of a doctor come together with cutting edge technology…magic happens. AI provides surgeons with a 3D map of the patient’s anatomy, allowing for greater precision and accuracy. ” He said, patients will not be charged extra for getting operation done via AI but only the cost of consumables used for AI tools will have to be paid for. “The technology that is being used for knee replacement will soon be used for shoulder and hip replacement too at our centre,” said Dr Somani. “As precision is high, the life of the implant in the patient's body lasts longer. Up to 20% life is added to the same implant when done with AI, as used in non-AI surgical methods for knee replacement,” said Dr Somani.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/knee-replacement-ai-enabled-op-starts/articleshow/101202831.cms

The order came while considering a public interest petition (PIL) filed by opposition leader V D Satheesan and senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala, seeking a court monitored investigation into the project. ""After perusing the exhibits, we are convinced that the matter needs to be examined from the perspective of changing dynamics of implementation of the project. Whether it is objective, Bonafede, or vitiated by any of the collateral reasons now stated in the petition,"" the division bench comprised Chief Justice S V Bhatti and Justice Basant Balaji observed. The court directed to issue notices to respondents, including the state government, state transport department and Keltron before admitting the petition. Besides, the court asked petitioners to file an additional affidavit in two weeks on the high standards of transparency, accountability and probity that they wish to see in public life and the implementation of the project. The court said it was seeking the affidavit in order to infuse more transparency in the decision-making process. The petitioners challenged the orders issued by the government, action taken by Keltron and the illegalities and corruption attached to the installation of AI cameras in the state, resulting in nepotism, favouritism and corruption, including violation of privacy. They argued that the project amount of Rs 232.25 crore was a highly inflated and it was not known to anyone how the respondents arrived at the figure. Initially, the government authorities decided to implement the project in the BOOT (Built, Own, Operate, Transfer) module with a five-year warranty. But later it turned to be a Cap EX (Capital Expenditure) model, the counsel for the petitioners pointed out.

2023-06-19,Sify to expand data centre capacity amid AI and digitisation boom,TNN,"Chennai: Information and communications technology (ICT) player Sify Technologies is expanding its data centre services capacity driven by an exponential growth in data generated by India Inc as it embarks on digitisation and applying Artificial Intelligence to business. Sify provides data centre colocation, network and security services to companies, and has a current data centre capacity of around 100 MW through 11 facilities across Chennai, Mumbai, Noida, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kolkata. The company has a roadmap to add around 350 MW of capacity in next couple of years. The capex committed towards expansion of data centre and network services is around 3,000 cr for next two years. Capex for FY 2023 stood at 1,322 crore. “We have committed plans on the ground for around 200 MW of design capacity, about 50 MW of which will become operational this financial year and the balance in following periods,” M P Vijay Kumar , Executive Director and Group CFO, Sify, told TOI in an interaction. Besides this, there are three greenfield data centre projects currently at design stage for Sify that will add another 110 MW of capacity. “The land acquisition for these is done,” he added. In Chennai, the company already has the ‘Chennai 1’ data centre at Tidel Park at a capacity of around 4 MW and another new facility is coming up at Siruseri. Sify also has a large network of Points of Presence (PoPs) (like mini data centres) in almost all key cities, and intends to meet data traffic needs in tier 2/3 cities by scaling PoP capacity from around 2-3 MW range to handle up to 5 MW. Sify posted consolidated revenue of 3,340 crore and profits of 67 crore for the fiscal year ended March 2023. During Jan-March 2023, among companies who moved their on-premise data center to Sify's cloud platforms are India’s largest private bank, a state data center, a cooperative bank, a health services major, and multiple financial services players. An automobile major, a manufacturing giant and a public sector bank were among those who signed up for network integration services. “Post the pandemic, there is a substantial demand from hyperscalers for capacity, and this is expected to grow at the current pace for the next 10 years at least,” Kumar says . Further, India's own digital story -be it government or BFSI or retail- has also helped boost demand for digital infra players like Sify. The data centre expansion is being planned with sustainability in mind, Kumar adds.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/sify-to-expand-data-centre-capacity-amid-ai-and-digitisation-boom/articleshow/101093521.cms
2023-06-18,AI to match Indian cancer patients with most effective clinical trials,TNN,"MUMBAI: A new artificial intelligence (AI)-based programme will help Indian patients who have a difficult-to-treat cancer find ongoing clinical trials that could best help them. While ""clinical trials"" are often viewed with suspicion in India, patient support groups in the western world help gravely ill cancer patients access clinical trials. ""Clinical trials are the only way to bring treatment to clinics, but in India we imitate and implement the western findings,"" said Dr Kumar Prabhash, professor from Tata Memorial Hospital. Now, a health tech company, Oncoshot India, plans to make clinical trials more accessible for Indian cancer patients. Its AI-based programme will match Indian cancer patients with clinical trials, thereby nudging global pharmaceutical companies to consider setting up local trials. At present, it has tied up with five hospitals across the country and managed to create a database of 25,000 cancer patients. In Mumbai, it tied up with Jaslok Hospital, Pedder Road, last week. Dr Milind Khadke of Jaslok Hospital said, ""The Indian cancer patient population will now have access to clinical trial matching services."" Dr Nilesh Atre of Oncoshot India said, ""In the next six months, we plan to tie up with more hospitals to increase our database to 1 lakh."" While the incidence of cancer in India is not as high as it is in first world countries, the volume of patients is huge due to the population. ""India has the highest population of cancer patients at any given time as estimated 2 million new cancer cases are detected in India,"" said Dr Atre. But patients are unaware about cancer clinical trials. Vandana Gupta of NGO V Care said clinical trials are necessary for the benefit of patients. ""However, patients should be empowered with information, especially the side-effects, before the start of the trial. Each trial should have an advocate who can guide patients at each and every step of the trial. Instead of medical jargon, patients should be given knowledge,"" she said. Concurring, Dr Prabash from Tata Memorial Hospital said only a handful of cancer patients with the economic means are able to go abroad and participate in clinical trials. ""Clinicals trials are big in the west, but small here,"" he said. A recent study by consultancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers said India has an overall clinical trial participation of approximately 3%. About a decade back, clinical trials were growing rapidly in India but reports emerged of patients not being educated about the trial goals, the medication or their side-effects. ""Back then, our clinical trials had several ethical issues. Consent forms were not available in local languages, and it was wrong to let patients sign on those papers,"" said a doctor. It is in this backdrop that Dr Atre said he believes his database will help. ""Data about patients' condition, their doctors and hospitals will be available in a transparent manner, thereby dispelling the perception that Indian hospitals are not organised,"" he said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ai-to-match-indian-cancer-patients-with-most-effective-clinical-trials/articleshow/101076039.cms

2023-06-18,"No Terminator-like AI yet but the risk is from systems that seem to be conscious, neuroscientist Anil Seth",Sharmila Ram,"Leading neuroscientist Anil Seth’s book ‘Being You: A New Science of Consciousness’ is a Sunday Times bestseller that emerged from 20 years of research into the relationship between consciousness and the brain. He talks to Sunday Times about the future of AI Your TED Talk ‘Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality’, has got more than 14 million views. Did you expect it to go viral? It’s been an enormous surprise! I think one reason for its popularity is that consciousness is both one of the deepest mysteries in all of science and philosophy, and also one of the most personal. We’ve all wondered about where we were before we were born or what happens after we die. And as science has advanced, the enigma that the brain somehow is the seat of everything that makes life worth living, just seems more and more compelling. What made you study consciousness? I remember a time when I was young — maybe seven or eight — looking in the mirror and wondering what was staring back at me, and dimly realising that at some point in the future what I called ‘I’ would cease to exist. I suppose I’ve been thinking about the mystery of consciousness in one way or another ever since then. But when I went to university in the early 1990s, to study natural sciences at Cambridge, consciousness was indeed off the menu. I remember being advised many times that pursuing an interest in consciousness would be a terrible career decision. What I didn’t know at the time was that a new science of consciousness was beginning to emerge, in a way that was well grounded in the mind and brain sciences as well as in philosophy. And so, after a PhD in artificial intelligence at the University of Sussex, I moved to California, to a place called The Neurosciences Institute where consciousness research was not only back on the menu, it was the main course. And I’ve never looked back. How do you define consciousness? And why does it matter? Consciousness is any kind of experience whatsoever — the redness of red, the painfulness of pain, the thirstiness of thirst. It is what makes us more than mere biological objects roaming around in the subjective dark. And this, of course, is why it matters. Without consciousness there would be no world, no self, no emotion, no agency — there would be nothing at all. Consciousness is what makes life worth living — and sometimes, seemingly, worth leaving. There is also a more philosophical way in which it matters. Something called the ‘sentience principle’ says that anything that has the capacity to be conscious has a moral status. If we accept this, and by and large we should, then understanding the nature of consciousness is absolutely fundamental to figuring out how we should behave in the world: how we should treat non-human animals, newborn infants, and perhaps even future machines. Growing up as the son of an Indian father and British mother in England, what was your perception of yourself? I grew up in South Oxfordshire, and besides a brief trip to the family home in Allahabad when I was six, my Indian heritage didn’t seem to feature much. But by my late teens I knew much more about both my Indian and my English heritage, and looking back now, I can see how formative this was. Living a life enriched by two cultures can inoculate you from taking how things seem for how they are. There is always another way, another view. And when in India, I almost feel as if I am a different person. This malleability of the self continues to fascinate and inspire me. You recently asked ChatGPT to write your bio. Did it do a good job? It was both surprisingly good and revealingly bad. It was right about fairly general things — what I do for a living, what my areas of expertise are within neuroscience — but it made mistakes about where I was born, where I studied for my PhD, and so on. When I asked it to redo it with fewer errors, it made things worse. At least in this current incarnation, AI really doesn’t understand or know anything at all. Should we be worried about AI becoming conscious? (Asking for a friend) There is plenty to worry about already such as the threats posed by misinformation, disinformation, biased decision making, image deepfakes and so on. We can no longer trust what we see or hear. And when AI algorithms are placed in control of things, we face the tricky problem of ‘value alignment’ — of making sure that an AI system acts for human or planetary benefit. This is turning out to be surprisingly challenging. These worries are often bundled together with the general fear that AI will become conscious and then set out to enslave or destroy humanity, as in films like ‘ Terminator ’. But this is lazy thinking. Intelligence and consciousness are different things, and there is no reason to assume that consciousness will just come along for the ride as AI gets smarter. Some tech companies, though, are deliberately trying to build conscious machines. Here there is a lot more uncertainty. Since we don’t yet know what is necessary for consciousness, we can’t rule out the possibility of conscious AI, whether it happens on purpose or by accident . Right now, we need to worry about AI that merely gives us the appearance of being conscious, even if, under the hood, there is no consciousness happening. With language models like GPT we are almost at this stage already. This will also be highly disruptive, because our minds are not equipped to interact with systems that we think have consciousness but do not.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/no-terminator-like-ai-yet-but-the-risk-is-from-systems-that-seem-to-be-conscious-neuroscientist-anil-seth/articleshow/101072487.cms

Should students interested in drawing take up architecture? This was the poser from Destination Designs founder Jyothika Baleri that triggered a discussion on careers in design and architecture. Ramesh Kalkur , associate director at Srishti Manipal Institute of Art, Design, and Tech, replied, ""Design is an interesting field because it is ever-changing. This right-brained/left-brained conversation has been around for a long time. Art and design have moved to a space where it is not just about aesthetics. We've moved to a space where it's about design thinking."" When Jyothika asked Vimala Swamy , principal of Gopalan School of Architecture, about the typical career trajectory of a design or architecture student in India, she said: ""Architecture and design are both a combination of art, science, and technology. Mind you, students will not learn just by reading a book. They have to see, analyse, observe, think, and come up with solutions. You have to think and produce your designs."" She further spoke about job opportunities in this sector such as architectural photography, content writing for architectural journals, private firms, public sectors, etc. On whether artificial intelligence (AI) would take away jobs, Prof Aleksandra Rotar , director of CMRU School of Design, said: ""The industry still requires designers and architects regardless of where AI is right now... It is true that many jobs are getting lost in the creative industry.

Bagging the Raymond and Josephine Vernon award for academic excellence and the Littauer award for leadership, Poddar is probably the only Indian student to accomplish this feat. During his one-year programme at the Harvard Kennedy School, Poddar learnt various aspects of security from experts. He attended a lecture by Graham Allison on American national security, a talk by US defence secretary Ash Carter on technology and security, Juliette Kayyem’s insights on internal security, AI from Bruce Schneier and a subject on China and security by William Alford. Poddar, a former zonal DCP from Nagpur and group commandant of the state reserve police force in Amravati, wants to use his knowledge in policing with a futuristic model pertaining to crime management. In the past, Poddar was honoured with the director general of police’s insignia for winning the first gold medal for Maharashtra police in the All-India equestrian meet for security forces. Earning a degree from the National School of Law, Poddar was among the few civil servants from India who were selected for the Fulbright scholarship to do a Masters in Public Administration at Harvard Kennedy School. A corporate lawyer-turned-IPS, Poddar did his LLM in international law as a Chevening scholar from Oxford University. Poddar was selected as an IPS officer while serving at Clifford Chance LLP, the world’s largest law firm. “The introduction of technology in law enforcement was my main takeaway. I would like to work on it now,” said Poddar, who served as SP in Malegaon and Beed, the most sensitive districts of Maharashtra. “The degree made me look at the future of national security and law enforcement. It gave me an understanding of where the world is headed in these areas,” said Poddar whose Covid management model was appreciated and studied by the ministry of home affairs.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-harvard-honour-he-wants-to-reform-policing-through-ai/articleshow/101077195.cms
2023-06-16,How AI will revolutionize the beauty and wellness industry,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), the new technological wonder has taken the world by storm. However, beauty brands using AI have hardly moved the needle on India’s overall beauty landscape. Finally, after years of hype in AI-driven beauty care, success is approaching fast. ChatGPT, the generative AI chatbot from OpenAI is facilitating this trend. Since its launch in late November last year, ChatGPT has broken the glass ceiling in AI driven businesses and given predictive solutions which you do not find by mere googling. Generative AI can transform the Beauty industry Here are some ways: 1. By becoming exponentially faster The human brain can easily predict the rate of arithmetic growth. But the implications of continuous, exponential growth prove impossible for the human mind to grasp. When it comes to generative AI, that’s the rate of growth beauticians can work with. 2. By helping in giving personalized service With the help of Artificial Intelligence, the customer may be able to find a skin profile that is totally personalized and unique, so much so that it may not fit another person. If such a detailed database is taken into account by product developers, it may be possible to make similar products, with or without a particular ingredient, which may be suited to one person, but not to another. Generative AI extracts useful information. A beautician can use the relevant information that applies to the client's symptoms. Generative AI will use billions of parameters to pinpoint appropriate remedies. 3. By helping in preventing errors Given OpenAI’s success in video-based artificial intelligence from companies like Meta, we expect machine-learning capabilities to evolve far beyond predicting text. This can be a boon for beauticians who are prone to cosmetic disasters. Beauty experts have defined steps needed to prevent unnecessary results. Yet, beauticians sometimes fail to follow evidence-based protocols. Video based Artificial intelligence minimizes the chances of human error substantially.

2023-06-16,One question that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella asks to test AI's smartness,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"It seems that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has one specific question to test the capability of a new AI model. The software giant's CEO shared the same during an interview with Wired recently. ""There is one query I always sort of use as a reference. Machine translation has been with us for a long time, and it's achieved a lot of great benchmarks, but it doesn't have the subtlety of capturing deep meaning in poetry,"" Nadella told the website. ""Growing up in Hyderabad, India, I'd dreamt about being able to read Persian poetry—in particular the work of Rumi, which has been translated into Urdu and then into English. GPT-4 did it, in one shot. It was not just a machine translation, but something that preserved the sovereignty of poetry across two language boundaries. And that's pretty cool,"" he said. As translations can be fickle, especially in poetry so Nadella termed this as the proper test of an AI model. For, he said that he wanted to gauge if GPT-4 would simply spit out a ""machine translation"" or preserve the ""sovereignty,"" as he put it, of Rumi's work. For those unaware, Jalaluddin Rumi , or Rumi as he's most commonly referred to, was a Persian poet who lived during the early 13th century. His work is widely celebrated around the world. The ultimate killer app When asked about if AI has shunted the metaverse into some other dimension, he replied, ""I still am a believer in [virtual] presence. In 2016 I wrote about three things I was excited about: mixed reality, quantum, and AI. I remain excited about the same three things. Today we are talking about AI, but I think presence is the ultimate killer app. And then, of course, quantum accelerates everything.""",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//gadgets-news/one-question-that-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-asks-to-test-ais-smartness/articleshow/101031322.cms

In a prior career, lead researcher Pok Man Tang , PhD, worked in an investment bank where he used AI systems, which led to his interest in researching the timely issue. “The rapid advancement in AI systems is sparking a new industrial revolution that is reshaping the workplace with many benefits but also some uncharted dangers, including potentially damaging mental and physical impacts for employees,” said Tang, an assistant professor of management at the University of Georgia . “Humans are social animals, and isolating work with AI systems may have damaging spillover effects into employees’ personal lives.” Going experimenting In one experiment, 166 engineers at a Taiwanese biomedical company who worked with AI systems were surveyed over three weeks about their feelings of loneliness, attachment anxiety and sense of belonging. Coworkers rated individual participants on their helpful behaviors, and family members reported on participants’ insomnia and after-work alcohol consumption. Employees who interacted more frequently with AI systems were more likely to experience loneliness, insomnia and increased after-work alcohol consumption, but also showed some helping behaviors toward fellow employees. In another experiment with 126 real estate consultants in an Indonesian property management company, half were instructed not to use AI systems for three consecutive days while the other half were told to work with AI systems as much as possible. The findings for the latter group were similar to the previous experiment, except there was no association between the frequency of AI use and after-work alcohol consumption. There were similar findings from an online experiment with 214 full-time working adults in the US and another with 294 employees at a Malaysian tech company. Tang said that moving forward, developers of AI technology should consider equipping AI systems with social features, such as a human voice, to emulate human-like interactions. Employers also could limit the frequency of work with AI systems and offer opportunities for employees to socialize. Team decision-making and other tasks where social connections are important could be done by people, while AI systems could focus more on tedious and repetitive tasks, Tang added. “Mindfulness programs and other positive interventions also might help relieve loneliness,” Tang said. “AI will keep expanding so we need to act now to lessen the potentially damaging effects for people who work with these systems.” All's not that bad At the same time, working with AI systems may have some benefits. The researchers found that employees who frequently used AI systems were more likely to offer help to fellow employees, but that response may have been triggered by their loneliness and need for social contact.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//gadgets-news/how-working-too-much-with-ai-may-hurt-you-at-workplace/articleshow/101031278.cms
2023-06-15,Accounting software Tally to soon sport AI capabilities,Sindhu Hariharan,"Chennai: Tally Solutions , a pioneer in business software, is working to incorporate the latest in technology including Artificial Intelligence (AI) to its flagship accounting software Tally with an aim to double revenue in the next couple of years. Over the next couple of years, Tally hopes to double its revenue growth from around 25% to almost 50% on the back of its product roadmap. “We are putting serious efforts to take advantage of AI in our system,” Tejas Goenka , managing director, Tally Solutions, told TOI. While Tally already has language-based query capabilities, we are also trying to implement accurate optical character recognition systems, and predictive and forecasting financial models, among others, he said.

2023-06-15,Lenovo to invest $1bn in AI infra solutions,"Jun 15, 2023, 08:05 IST","Bengaluru: A day after Accenture announced a $3 billion investment over three years in its data and AI practice, Lenovo has announced a $1 billion investment to advance its AI infrastructure solutions. The announcements reflect the impact that ChatGPT has had on the overall AI environment around the world. Sumir Bhatia, president for Asia Pacific at Lenovo ISG (Infrastructure Solutions Group), said the investment will go into three broad areas. About $100 million will go into bolstering the company’s AI innovators’ programme, which was launched about a year ago and under which it partners with ISVs (independent software vendors) to develop and further enhance AI-ready solutions. “We currently have 45 partners globally. And within the past year, we have already delivered over 150 turnkey AI solutions across various verticals. Our plan is to accelerate this,” Bhatia said. Lenovo has partnered with DeepBrain AI, a video creation venture, to offer a solution for generative AI virtual assistants that can be paired with powerful large language models (LLMs) to deliver 24/7 automated concierge service in hospitality and retail settings. It has worked with Guise, which has expertise on doing AI at the edge, to help industrial customers reduce unplanned downtime with up to 14 days of advanced prediction, as well as understand customer behaviour and optimise processes with computer vision, predictive maintenance, and anomaly detection on the production line. Lenovo’s second major investment area will be AI infrastructure, an area where it’s revenue has already crossed $2 billion. Bhatia said they already have more than 66 AI-optimised platforms – across devices, edge and core. The plan is to enhance this. “Analysts say 75% of data is going to be at the edge. So, it's very important that we continue to build and enhance AI platforms at the edge. Also, we need to ensure that when customers use AI, at every point the infrastructure is invisible, and that will happen when the infrastructure is very reliable, and it meets the demands of AI solutions,” Bhatia said. The quality of infrastructure is key, given AI’s use of massive amounts of data, and the need to process all that quickly. The third part of the investment will go into helping customers discover areas where AI can be applied. Towards this, the company has established a new AI Discover Centre of Excellence, which provides access to Lenovo’s data scientists, AI architects and engineers to help explore, deploy and scale AI solutions. The service also guides customers to the most appropriate software partners, AI-optimised infrastructure, and responsible AI guidance. “The idea is to accelerate the adoption of AI,” Bhatia said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/lenovo-to-invest-1bn-in-ai-infra-solutions/articleshow/101005790.cms
2023-06-15,How YouTube may help Google beat OpenAI in artificial intelligence â€˜warâ€™,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"OpenAI , the company that developed ChatGPT chatbot, got an early lead in generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology. However, a report has now claimed that its probable toughest rival Google is pretty much well equipped to compete with it, especially after it upgraded its Bard chatbot with a new machine-learning model post I/O 2023. Google announced PaLM 2, its state-of-the-art language model with improved multilingual, reasoning and coding capabilities in May this year. Top Picks For You Google’s Pixel June Feature Drop brings cinematic wallpaper, improved safety features, and more How Google is helping brands automate advertising with AI The company has since been making regular updates in problem solving capabilities of its AI chatbot Bard. According to a report by the Information, while Google develops a sequel to PaLM 2, “it may hold a trump card: YouTube.” The Google-owned streaming website is arguably “the single biggest and richest source of imagery, audio and text transcripts on the internet.” Citing a person with knowledge of the situation, the report said that Google’s researchers have been using YouTube to develop its next large-language model, Gemini . It is to be noted that Google CEO Sundar Pichai talked about how Google brought together DeepMind and Google Brain to make Google DeepMind, which is using computational resources and building more capable systems, safely and responsibly. “Gemini was created from the ground up to be multimodal, highly efficient at tool and API integrations and built to enable future innovations, like memory and planning,” he said, noting that it offers “impressive multimodal capabilities not seen in prior models.” OpenAI reportedly trained its AI models on YouTube YouTube as a data source is a hot property, and the report also claimed that OpenAI secretly used data from the platform to train some of its AI models, one person with direct knowledge of the effort was quoted as saying. It is to be noted that YouTube’s terms of service forbid using content for anything other than “personal, non-commercial use.” However, it is known that in the AI industry everyone is scraping the web constantly. The development comes about two and half months after media reports said that Google used ChatGPT data to train Bard. It was also claimed that Google used data from OpenAI’s ChatGPT, scraped from a website called ShareGPT, to train Bard. The Pixel smartphone maker, however, denied saying “Bard is not trained on any data from ShareGPT or ChatGPT.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//gadgets-news/how-youtube-may-help-google-beat-openai-in-artificial-intelligence-war/articleshow/101001496.cms
2023-06-14,"Facebook AI, cops team up to save lives","Jun 14, 2023, 08:25 IST","Ahmedabad: A disturbing trend of distraught individuals taking to social media sites to live-stream their suicide attempts has picked up in the state and the government is concerned. In the past 45 days alone, the cyber cell of Gujarat CID crime has received intimations of texts and videos of 17 individuals who took to Facebook and Instagram to live-stream their attempts to end their lives. Thanks to the AI software on these sites — it scans user-generated content, identifies users at high risk for suicide and notifies cops — interventions took place in time to save their lives. Some of the recent cases were reported from Bharuch, Navsari , Bhuj and places on the outskirts of Surat, Ahmedabad and other major towns of Gujarat. The reasons for the suicide attempts were principally economic distress, relationship break-ups and disagreements between family members or friends. Of the 17 cases, 11 were from the districts in Gujarat and six cases were of migrants who had gone back to their native places in other states. Almost all these victims could be saved with the help of an active local district police. In many cases, the local police also call ambulances to help the victims. Just recently, a severely depressed 28-year-old youth from Jambusar logged onto Facebook with a pesticide bottle in hand to live-stream his suicide attempt. Crying profusely, he took a few swigs of the toxic concoction and lay on his bed as FB streamed the goings-on. A team from Facebook immediately alerted the cyber cell of Gujarat CID crime with details of his mobile phone and location. The local police team rushed the youth to SSG Hospital in Vadodara just in time and saved his life. Explaining the process of identification and response, state cyber cell DySP HB Tank said, “Facebook and Instagram have special Artificial Intelligence (AI) trained software that scans videos, audio and texts and flags off any post that it rates as ‘suicide risk’. A team from these social media platforms quickly analyses the flagged media content by the AI systems and then alerts our anti-bullying unit team of Gujarat CID crime.” The state cyber cell operates a 24x7 helpline which reaches out to the victim, keeps them engaged over the phone till the local police locate them via the phone IP address and location. “There were a few cases of teenagers where they admitted that they never drank poison and were only acting. In such cases too, we alert their parents as the child had reached a state where he was contemplating suicide,” said a senior CID crime official. The official added that there were 29 other distress calls that they had attended to on helpline 1930 owing to online harassment in the past 45 days. “In the coming weeks, we will be taking professional help from trained psychiatrists to talk to the victims and help reduce negative emotions that drive them to suicide. This also gives us enough time to reach them,” says Tank. He told TOI, “The key here is coordination and active involvement of local police stations within the city commissionerate and within the district police jurisdictions, which helped us save lives.” “We don’t want to reveal the names or locations of those whom we traced and rescued as it is a sensitive matter and there is a likelihood of more people mimicking them,” said a senior CID crime official who did not wish to be quoted. He added that in the previous two weeks nine and five individuals were saved respectively.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/facebook-ai-cops-team-up-to-save-lives/articleshow/100979813.cms

In an interview with BBC Radio 4 that aired on Tuesday, McCartney did not name the track but said the technology was used on ""a demo that John had, that we worked on"". ""So when we came to make what will be the last Beatles record... we were able to take John's voice and get it pure through this AI (artificial intelligence), so that then we could mix the record as you would normally do,"" the singer-songwriter, 80, said. ""We just finished it up, it will be released this year."" McCartney did not name the song that has been recorded but according to the BBC it is likely to be ""Now And Then"", one of several tracks on a cassette that Lennon had recorded as demo in 1978, two years before his death in 1980. Lennon was fatally shot outside his New York apartment building. His widow, Yoko Ono, gave the tape to McCartney as he, Ringo Starr and George Harrison, who died in 2001, were working on ""The Beatles Anthology"", a career-retrospective documentary, record and book series. Two of the songs, ""Free As A Bird"" and ""Real Love"", were cleaned up by the producer Jeff Lynne, and released in 1995 and 1996. An attempt was made to do the same with ""Now And Then"" but the project was abandoned because of background noise on the demo. McCartney said director Peter Jackson had used the technology for the 2021 documentary series ""The Beatles: Get Back"", which looks at the Fab Four making their 1970 album ""Let It Be"". ""He was able to extricate John's voice from a ropey little bit of cassette,"" McCartney said. ""We had John's voice and a piano, he could separate them with AI."" The use of artificial intelligence in music has sparked both excitement and fear of what the technology could bring. Asked about it, McCartney said: ""It's a very interesting thing... it's something we're all sort of tackling at the moment and trying to deal with"". ""There's a good side to it and then a scary side, and we'll just have to see where that leads.""",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/last-beatles-song-to-be-released-this-year-thanks-to-ai-mccartney/articleshow/100979258.cms

Top Picks For You Microsoft brings Bing Chat widget to Android: How to use OpenAI wants to fix ChatGPT ‘hallucinations’, here’s how Some Microsoft executives were reportedly surprised with the launch of ChatGPT AI chatbot. The report also notes that OpenAI gave Microsoft a few weeks’ heads up that it would start publicly testing ChatGPT at a time when the software giant was beginning to integrate OpenAI’s models into Bing. “Some Microsoft executives had misgivings about the timing of ChatGPT’s launch last fall,” the report cited people familiar with the matter, as saying. While some employees were worried that ChatGPT would steal the new Bing’s thunder, the people said, others argued Bing could benefit from how the public use ChatGPT. OpenAI powering Microsoft rivals Microsoft is aligned with OpenAI and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella , in a response to allegations levelled by Tesla CEO Elon Musk earlier this year, said the company doesn’t control the ChatGPT-maker. The report noted that this type of relationship has allowed OpenAI to strike deals with some of Microsoft’s biggest rivals, such as Salesforce and DuckDuckGo. “Microsoft has effectively limited the potential search-engine customers for OpenAI,” the report noted, adding that “Microsoft and OpenAI sales teams sometimes pitch the same customers.” Reportedly, Microsoft has also complained about diminished spending on its in-house AI OpenAI warned Microsoft over wrong responses In February this year, Microsoft opened a limited preview of its GPT-4-powered Bing Chat . But soon, the company had to limit chat sessions as people reported that the AI chatbot went “rogue.” The report said that “OpenAI had suggested Microsoft to move slower on integrating its AI technology with Bing.” It reportedly highlighted the risks of releasing a chatbot based on an unreleased version of its GPT-4 “that hadn’t been given more training,” the people familiar with the matter claimed. “Microsoft went ahead with the release of the Bing chatbot.

But as they try to flee, Delhi Police personnel land at the spot almost simultaneously and catch them red-handed. Although cops have a reputation of arriving late to a crime scene, the situation could drastically change in the future with the force rapidly progressing towards adopting solutions based on artificial intelligence (AI) for several aspects of policing. Top Picks For You AI object, Milord? The jury's out on chatbots in the legal system The example stated above is not just a 'precrime'-like concept from the Hollywood movie Minority Report. In fact, experiments have been conducted wherein hotspots of chain snatchings have been fed into the system, along with data of habitual offenders and time of reporting of such crimes to predict a possible strike. ""A full AI-based solution may give us the required boost in achieving better crime prevention rates,"" said a senior officer dealing with technology in city policing. After Union home minister Amit Shah emphasised the use of tech in policing three years ago, Delhi Police has been aggressively pursuing and exploring AI-based solutions. Initiatives like e-Beat Book, integrated complaint monitoring system, 'Safe City' project, integration of crime and criminal tracking system, inter-operable criminal justice system and office automation are some of the examples where technology and AI are set to play a huge role. Setting up of separate police technological and social media cells during the tenure of former police chief SN Shrivastava also proved to be milestones in the functioning of the force. ""Delhi Police has signed two memoranda of understanding with National Forensic Science University, Gujarat, and IIIT Delhi for making optimum use of technology and AI in police working,"" said a senior officer. ""The Safe City project, for example, will have 15,000 cameras integrated with those at railway stations, bus stands and the ones installed by Delhi government. The camera feed would be monitored at police headquarters and AI will help in taking precautionary measures. It is going to be a milestone in curbing crime,"" the officer added. In January last year, Delhi Police had introduced AI-based phonetic keyboard for Hindi typing to lodge FIRs and write case diaries in CCTNS. This system has an integrated dictionary of traditional Hindi/Urdu words often used in police work. ""The system catches new Hindi and Urdu words too and stores these in the database, thus expanding its vocabulary to include all words and syntax used in police work. It has improved the speed, accuracy and efficiency of police functioning in terms of maintaining proper records digitally,"" said another senior officer. ""While this was a big challenge for the cops, the use of AI on a small scale made a huge difference. It shows how AI can make a big difference in police functioning in the future,"" he added. Delhi Police and IIT-Delhi have also signed an MoU aiming to induct the latest innovations and technologies in policing. Surveillance and anti-terror measures are two other aspects where cops hope artificial intelligence will make a huge difference and help immensely.

2023-06-10,AI impact: Indians 2nd most optimistic,Sindhu Hariharan,"Chennai: Despite fears around what advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) will mean for a large global labour market like India, the sentiment around it is still largely optimistic. India has emerged as the second most optimistic country in the world (after Brazil) when it comes to the transformative impact of AI, specifically Generative AI. A global survey of 13,000 employees by BCG showed that sentiments about AI in the workplace vary by geography- the most optimistic are Brazil (71%), India (60%), and the Middle East (58%). The least optimistic are the US (46%), the Netherlands (44%), and Japan (40%). Seventy three percent of respondents in India believe the rewards of generative AI outweigh the risks. Respondents in India are optimistic today about how AI will affect their work even more so than five years ago, feeling that it will save them time and promote innovation in their roles, the survey finds. Majority of the workforce believes that the advent of AI will reinvent their jobs and not kill them completely. 88% of respondents in India believe their job is likely to be transformed in many ways by AI and around 51% fear that their job is likely to no longer exist due to AI. But, there are also some concerns including that companies are not taking adequate measures to ensure responsible use of AI. While globally, 79% respondents believe that AI-specific regulations are necessary Among respondents in India, 89% believe AI-specific regulation is necessary. “In a country where the sheer size of data points being generated every day is enormous, AI is already demonstrating how it can have a meaningful impact for businesses. And all this while making work more efficient and fulfilling for employees. Our survey also reflects this optimism,” Nipun Kalra, managing director & partner, and head of BCG X in India, said. Within organisations, senior leaders, who are more frequent users of generative AI, are more optimistic (62%) and less concerned about it than frontline employees (42%). As per the survey, the countries and workforce least concerned about AI-led disruption are the Middle East (25%), Brazil (19%), and India (14%).",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ai-impact-indians-2nd-most-optimistic/articleshow/100888935.cms

2023-06-10,Artificial intelligence has vast potential in Indiaâ€™s tech ecosystem: PM Modi,TNN,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and said on Friday that artificial intelligence’s (AI’s) potential in enhancing India’s tech ecosystem is vast, among the youth in particular. “We welcome all collaborations that can accelerate our digital transformation for empowering our citizens,” he tweeted, describing the conversation with Altman as insightful. Earlier, Altman said in a tweet through his handle @sama, “Great conversation with @narendramodi discussing India’s incredible tech ecosystem and how the country can benefit from AI. Really enjoyed all my meetings with people in the @PMOIndia.” Modi replied, “Thank you for the insightful conversation @sama. The potential of AI in enhancing India’s tech ecosystem is indeed vast and that too among the youth in particular. We welcome all collaborations that can accelerate our digital transformation for empowering our citizens.” Minister of state for IT & electronics Rajeev Chandrasekhar said AI does not pose much risk to jobs as the technology in its current form is largely task-oriented and not capable of dealing with a situation where logic and reasoning are needed. PM Narendra Modi meets ChatGPT CEO Sam Altman, says 'Potential of AI in enhancing India's tech ecosystem is indeed vast' “While AI is disruptive, we do not see in the next few years the so-called threat of replacing the jobs. Because the current stage of the development of AI is very task-oriented and not reasoning, logic, etc,” he said. “Jobs usually have reasoning and logic and AI is not as sophisticated at this point,” the minister said. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman: ‘India has truly embraced ChatGPT’ On AI regulation, Chandrasekhar said the government will regulate it, taking into consideration aspects of user harm. “We will safeguard digital citizens through this technology. Our approach towards AI regulation is very simple. We will regulate AI as we regulate Web 3 or any emerging technologies to ensure they do not harm digital citizens.” Altman, whose company deals with artificial intelligence technologies and has created ChatGPT, met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the national capital and discussed various aspects of AI including the need for global regulation.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/artificial-intelligence-has-vast-potential-in-indias-tech-ecosystem-pm-modi/articleshow/100884894.cms
2023-06-09,artificial intelligence and the future of work,Arnab Bhattacharya,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has pervaded almost every field of innovation and development, starting from driverless cars to recommendation of products online to personalised healthcare and natural language conversations. Sensors and internet-of-things (IoT) are delving into our lives more rapidly than we realise. Governments, financial institutions and big industries are relying on cyber-physical systems for their day-to-day activities. The question, however, is how long before the institutions become too dependent on it? Given the tremendous progress of AI in speech and language processing, computer vision, etc, it is conceivable that in the near future, almost any task that is “measurable’’ will be taken over b y AI. The increasing success of AI in super-skilled application scenarios such as in medical and legal domains clearly reinforce this trend. Even in tasks that are considered to be purely based on human creativity, such as writing poetry, painting, and composing music, success of AI is impressive and worrying to many who practise it. What then will be left for humans in the future? The answer probably lies in the way current AI models are designed. At their heart, they are mathematical tools, albeit too complex for humans to explain. This, therefore, leads to the conclusion that anything that can be “measured’’ in terms of numbers can be solved by AI models. Thus, humans may not be required for these so-called “left-brain’’ functions. This disruption calls for a massive re-skilling of the human population. Humans should focus on developing and utilising right-brain skills, such as critical thinking, creativity, emotional intelligence, and empathy. These skills are difficult for AI to replicate and will become increasingly valuable in the future of work. We should focus on developing skills that complement AI technology, such as data analysis and programming, as well as skills that involve human interaction, such as customer service and healthcare. Ultimately, humans need to be flexible, adaptable, and have a zeal to continuously learn to thrive in a world with AI technology. Instead of worrying about jobs being taken over by AI, we should focus on the tasks that AI will be fulfilling. We’ve already been using AI features like auto-correct and auto-complete. AI will take care of grunt work and save time. We need to learn how to use AI effectively and diversify our work requirements. AI may open up newer avenues or scopes of learning and employment. Rather than fearing the changes brought by AI, students and young engineers should embrace the opportunities it presents. As AI is taking over the academic sphere as well, we might probably have to wait for a decisive overhaul of education. Educational institutions would need to incorporate AI into the curriculum like other mandatory subjects, provide opportunities for students to work on AI-related projects, and develop programmes that teach skills that are difficult for AI to replicate, such as creativity and emotional intelligence. In addition, educational institutions need to focus on developing lifelong learning skills and promote a culture of continuous learning, as the skills required in the workforce will continue to evolve and change as AI technology advances. The youth of today stand at the threshold of several unprecedented challenges both in terms of technology as well as societal and ethical values that are set to disrupt the world order. Summits like the Y20 Summit by the Union ministry of youth affairs and sports can be some pertinent platforms to involve the youth in these crucial discussions and collectively seek ideas and recommendations for the future of work.

2023-06-09,New VC plans to draft AI policy for Mumbai varsity,TNN,"MUMBAI: Mumbai University ’s new vice-chancellor, Ravindra Kulkarni, plans to draw an Artificial Intelligence (AI) policy, taking cue from leading global universities such as the Cambridge. His focus, during his tenure, will be to strengthen the industry-academia relationship in the era of industry 4.0 — characterised by increased automation and digitisation. Kulkarni, who took charge as the university’s VC from acting VC DT Shirke on Thursday afternoon, said that he will be working towards raising funds through corporate social responsibility (CSR) for developing infrastructure. He was speaking to the media after his welcome event, organised by the university. “Having an AI policy will soon become imperative for us too. In the coming year or two, we plan to develop a policy, which will not only look at plagiarism, but also its use in making teaching-learning methods more effective,” said Kulkarni, adding that AI can be used even for processing students’ data for various activities. He also spoke at length about taking advantage of the rapid changes that are happening in the industry 4.0 era and its impact on academia. “We need to take advantage of being in the financial capital of the country, build relationships with the industry for research, encourage start-ups, and raise funds through CSR...,” he said. Kulkarni said after the implementation of the National Education Policy 2020 this year, major changes will also be seen in degree, postgraduate course design, credit system, academic bank of credit, multi-institutional learning, teaching, learning and evaluation, he said. tnn",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/new-vc-plans-to-draft-ai-policy-for-mumbai-varsity/articleshow/100862750.cms
2023-06-09,"AI doomsday talk is too sci-fiâ€¦ itâ€™s a tool, not a creature: Sam Altman",TNN,"Responding to points raised by TOI Group’s Samir Jain in an interactive session, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the best use of the tech is as a guide & assistant... For OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, the risk of AI is not that it will threaten humanity, but that the tech can be a tool of oppression in the hands of dictators. Altman was responding to a point raised by Samir Jain of The Times of India Group, in an interactive session that was part of the ET Conversations event. Times Group VC and MD Samir Jain asks OpenAI CEO Sam Altman if AI can learn to be 'human' Jain asked Altman about Harari’s warnings against AI. “I had dinner with Harari a couple of nights ago. We talked about this, in Tel Aviv,” Altman shared. While a lot of the concerns out there are too sci-fi in his thinking (Altman was likely including Elon Musk’s talk of ‘civilisation destruction’ here), the scenario Altman finds truly scary and “not super faraway” is the misuse of AI by oppressive regimes. (From left) Samir Jain, Sam Altman and Times Internet vice-chairman Satyan Gajwani. Picture: Tarun Rawat “We need to build these systems in a way to address that risk and I think it is going to be a very complicated, global geopolitical challenge. ” In this context, Altman and Jain discussed an analogy between AI and nuclear technology, for the purpose of regulation. Just as nuclear materials can be both beneficial and dangerous and are therefore audited by a body like IAEA, so should AI. Another of Jain’s questions twinned the two fundamental aspects of humanity — intelligence and love. If love is as important for humans as intelligence, what’s been the progress in making AI capable of love, Jain asked Altman?“I hope that we don’t all fall in love with robots, that would be deeply depressing,” Altman answered. What he hopes happens instead is that we all become the best versions of ourselves, with AI acting as guide and assistant. “This question of whether AI is a tool or a creature is something that really confuses a lot of people. And it confused me for a while too. But I now think we are very much building a tool and not a creature. And I am very happy about that. I think we should and will continue in that direction,” Altman elaborated. But if the tool becomes too powerful it will reduce the individual satisfaction we get, from jobs and from creativity, worried CBFC chairperson Prasoon Joshi . “I think what happens when you give people better tools is that they do better things, they do more impressive things. The floor lifts up, the expectations lift up,” Altman replied. On the topic of creating something that doesn’t exist today, Swati Bhargava, co-founder of CashKaro, asked Altman how he keeps inspiration high across his company. Altman shared, “We really care about talent density. A lot of companies have talented people but if you have even a few mediocre people mixed in there they kind of act like the neutron absorbers and stuff just goes wrong. So, we really try to have extreme talent density. ” After doing AI for so long, what has Altman learned about humans? His answer to this question from CRED founder Kunal Shah would have surprised many: “I grew up implicitly thinking that intelligence was this really special human thing and somewhat magical. And I now think that it is sort of the fundamental property of matter. ” “The history of scientific discovery is that humans are less and less at the centre. With AI we are even further and further away from main character energy,” Altman said. That might disturb many, but AI’s best known evangelist clearly has a different perspective on the world.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ai-doomsday-talk-is-too-sci-fi-its-a-tool-not-a-creature-sam-altman/articleshow/100861933.cms
2023-06-09,Telangana mulls own version of ChatGPT for govt services,Sribala Vadlapatla,"The state government has been collaborating with the WEF to develop a platform that would provide data and answer queries for a wide range of services HYDERABAD: While Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI and creator of ChatGPT, tours India discussing the need for change in socio-economic outlook and government views about such platforms, Telangana has already been on a quest of its own to implement similar AI-based chatbots for various government services. The state government has been collaborating with the World Economic Forum (WEF) to develop a platform that would provide data and answer queries for a wide range of services. Govt employees to be sensitised on AI-based chatbots A large workshop with all government departments was scheduled for June 8 in collaboration with WEF, but it was postponed due to the decennial celebrations of the formation of Telangana state. The workshop will take place later this month, officials said. It is meant to discuss information and services for which large amounts of data from various domains could be provided to an open source technology platform. ""Not only ChatGPT, but a few other AI-based chatbots are now available. We are studying them to see if the government's vast data can be modelled into such a form. A small internal team of experts is already working on it. Keeping in mind the pros and cons of such technologies, our goal is to make its best use for the benefit of our citizens by offering all government services. It is certainly not meant to replace any job,"" Jayesh Ranjan, principal secretary for information technology, said. Officials said most of these AI-based chatbots use open source coding but, in the absence of all Telangana government services data, they may not provide accurate answers for specific queries. Once such a platform is in place, then, for instance, a farmer looking for a loan will get all his queries answered on how he can get it, rules, the appropriate apps, etc. ""While it is extremely difficult for a government or company to develop its own version of ChatGPT at this time, open source of these tools can be used and our government data can be fed into them. We are now assessing the things it can be applied to,"" said Rama Devi Lanka, director of emerging technologies wing. Also, as part of this AI introduction mission in government, all employees will be sensitised on how AI-based chatbots work and what their potential applications are.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tgana-mulls-own-version-of-chatgpt-for-govt-services/articleshow/100860938.cms
2023-06-09,"AI, physical edu, music introduced for Class XI kids",TNN,"Image used for representative purpose only PANAJI: From the academic year 2023-24, artificial intelligence and physical education will be some of the new subjects that will be offered as the seventh and optional subject at Class IX. Students now choose one of 19 subjects for their seventh subject. They have to clear any six subjects to pass the class. The seventh subject was available in Goa under the National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF) scheme. Later, fine arts and astronomy were also offered in willing schools as the seventh subject. Besides this, for several years now, pre-vocational subjects were offered in some schools. Now, all these three schemes have been merged into the NSQF scheme and students have a choice of 19 subjects. “Fourteen subjects are NSQF subjects and the rest are AI , physical education, fine arts, astronomy, music, domestic and electrical wiring, cookery, horticulture, electrical and electronics. Students will have to opt for the seventh subject at least by the second term of Class IX to get the benefit of the scheme. The existing teachers in the school itself with an interest in the subjects will teach the new subjects,” said chairperson of Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, Bhagirath Shetye. AI will be taught by computer teachers, he said, adding that the board will train the teachers in the AI syllabus. “The subject will be taught like a full-fledged subject with five classes a week, and there will be a practical component. Students who opt for AI will be exempted from attending the existing subject of computers and information technology (ICT),” said Shetye. As part of AI, students will study topics like the basics of AI, artificial intelligence ethics, Python programming, neural network, emerging careers in AI, and the use of AI for a better world. The AI subject will be implemented in all schools that are not offering the NSQF subjects. The AI textbook for Class IX will be made available in bookshops, stated the Goa Board circular. The board circular stated that Class XI students will be taught the same AI/ICT syllabus for 2023-24.

2023-06-08,"Job fears, ChatGPT5 timeline and 5 other things OpenAI CEO Sam Altman talked about",TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman spoke on a wide array of themes — from the investor frenzy around generative artificial intelligence (AI) to the fears of rampant unemployment that the adoption of the technology may lead to — during his conversation with The Economic Times in New Delhi on Wednesday (June 7). He was in a discussion with Times Internet vice chairman Satyan Gajwani . There were over 200 attendees from across the country at the event, including founders of top internet firms, investment funds, government officials and more. During his India visit, Altman is also expected to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi , the minister of electronics and information technology Ashwini Vaishnaw and the minister of state for electronics and information technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar. Here are key takeaways from the event Accepts the job loss fears, but it's not all gloom Altman agreed that perhaps the biggest fear around AI adoption is of job losses that would follow across sectors. “In two generations, we kind of adapt to any labour market change, and we see new jobs that are usually better. That is going to happen here too. Some jobs are going to go away. But there will be new, better jobs that are difficult to imagine,” he said. Speed is the difference this time “The thing that might be different about this is the speed at which this could happen, and I think it would require a change to the socio-economic contract and the way governments think about this,"" he said pointing out how the change might be different this time. World needs to come together to regulate AI Regulating AI too has been one of the biggest concerns across the world with countries debating on guidelines. Responding to a question on ethical guidelines in AI, the OpenAI chief said, “Those are not OpenAI's decisions to make. It's for the world to democratise. Our recent funding into such projects is to help enable that,"" and added, “I think the world should come together. This is an existential risk. If the governments cannot, we will ask the companies to do it."" Gave no timeline for ChatGPT5 Altman did not give any timeline on the launch of GPT5, saying that it still needs a lot of research.

2023-06-08,AI will create new jobs but some old ones may die fast: Open AI CEO Sam Altman,TNN,"NEW DELHI: AI is a disruptor for sure, but it isn’t a permanent job killer, though the speed of change may be so high that governments may need to think of new socioeconomic contracts, said the unofficial leader of the global AI revolution. Sam Altman , CEO of OpenAI, creator of ChatGPT and the man at the centre of a global debate on AI, is everything you expect tech superstars to be – dressed down, cool, self-deprecating, funny, evangelical about technology and very, very smart. But as was evident during his freewheeling chat with Satyan Gajwani , vice-chairman, Times Internet Ltd – the event was part of the Economic Times Conversations series – Altman is also disarmingly honest when answering pointed questions. He didn’t give a ‘future is all bright’ kind of answer to the question everyone who uses ChatGPT and everyone who doesn’t are asking – will AI destroy jobs? Exclusive: Times Internet’s Satyan Gajwani talks to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman To some extent, yes, AI will kill jobs, Altman said, just as every tech revolution does. The good part, he argued, is that tech-induced paradigm shifts also create new, better jobs and history shows labour markets adopt to disruptions in two generations. But and as he explained, there’s a significant ‘but’: “The thing that might be different this is the speed at which (this change) will happen. It will require a change in the socioeconomic contract and the way governments think about (this disruption).” Altman said he was all for “sovereign” research on AI, that he agreed that many countries and their governments may feel queasy about a life-defining technology being owned solely by one or a few foreign companies, and that India was one of the better-placed countries where a government-funded AI project can produce results. On regulation, he was unequivocal in welcoming it, pointing out that the scale of disruption – “we are on an exponential curve”, he said – meant that governments cannot but intervene. This wasn’t the only time Altman broke the mould of Silicon Valley tech CEOs, who are typically, at least when their company first starts making waves, wary of government-funded research and regulation. They also don’t much like questions on negative effects of their technology. AI dominates London Robot Show Altman – he was shown an AI-powered but discernibly fake video of him in which he said the guy on stage with him was good-looking – also agreed that deepfakes and fraud were real dangers of this new tech. But he said he’s confident that tech will evolve to meet this challenge, that there will be easily accessible solutions that will establish authenticity. Although the Stanford dropout who was told by one of his professors that working on AI-like tech was a career-ender doesn’t think AI will mean the end of the world, he was also clear that most people aren’t appreciating the scale and speed of change that’s coming. “ChatGPT 10 will be nothing like ChatGPT 4”, he said, making the point that enormous and rapid transformation means those working on AI must budget for even the smallest possibility – the famous 1% extinction risk – for an end-of-the-world like scenario and therefore must develop mitigating tech. Sam’s Side Hustle What does the man who may have seen the future do apart from developing AI, Satyan Gajwani asked Altman. He invests in and champions nuclear fusion, the holy grail of abundant, nearly zero-carbon and, at scale, very cheap energy production. Very few people in the world work on two future-defining techs at the same time. But that’s Sam Altman for you.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ai-will-create-new-jobs-but-some-old-ones-may-die-fast-open-ai-ceo-sam-altman/articleshow/100831205.cms

The second close also saw participation by Carnelian Asset Advisors Pvt Ltd and affiliates. This funding follows the first close done with 360 ONE Asset Management Limited (formerly known as IIFL Asset Management Limited) in May 2023. This funding will be augmented by the company’s own cash reserves and cash accruals to provide for an M&A war chest in the range of USD 80 million. Ashwin Mittal, Chairman and CEO of Course5 Intelligence, said, “The data and AI revolution is finally here and the scope and scale of AI deployments across global enterprises are going to rapidly increase in the coming years. Recent advances in Generative AI, natural language and computer perception have completely removed the boundaries of what is possible. We want to ensure we maintain our leadership position amongst AI & Analytics solution providers by adding strategically to our portfolio to maximize our value proposition to global corporates.” The penetration of advanced analytics & AI in enterprises is at a very nascent stage globally and recent advances in technological innovations may be the tipping point for wide-spread, democratic adoption across industries and one that will likely see consistent growth over the next decade. Partnering with Course5 to capitalize on this opportunity is a natural fit for Nuvama Private Equity’s Crossover fund strategy, that has over time successfully identified and invested in leaders across sectors with structural growth, and in companies with established business models and seasoned management teams. ICICI Securities and JM Financial acted as the exclusive financial advisors to the company. Course5 is said to be currently in talks with five companies and plans to complete two acquisitions, over a period of 12 months.

2023-06-06,"Will focus on generative AI, EVs: VC firm Matrix",TNN,"Venture capital firm Matrix Partners India, which has backed unicorns like Ola and Razorpay, recently closed a $550-million fund, making one of its largest bets on the startup space. Managing directors Tarun Davda and Rajinder Balaraman said large portions of the investments raised through the new fund will be earmarked for emerging technologies like generative AI, EVs and semiconductors. The duo talked to TOIabout their investment strategy, AI regulation and angel tax issue. Excerpts: How much of the fund has already been deployed? Rajinder: We don’t disclose exact percentage figures on how much has been deployed. To date, we have completed 18 investments through the fund. A few may be in the process of being closed. Are these 18 investments spread across sectors or are there certain areas which you will look at more closely? Rajinder: With this fund ($550 million), we will focus more on core tech kind of areas like EVs, semiconductors, Web 3. That’s reflective of the broader market and not a shift in strategy for us. In terms of stage, we continue to stay focused on series-A, which is early stage for us. There’s a lot of buzz around AI. What kind of bets will you make on AI-based startups? Tarun: We have already taken some early bets in the space and made some three investments so far. The bread and butter sectors for the firm historically have been fintech, consumer tech, SaaS (software-as-a-service)…these sectors continue to remain important. From the new fund, what we would like to do is basically start investing in what we call emerging sectors —one of those is generative AI. We will also be investing in semiconductors where we are seeing actually some pretty good activity in the Indian ecosystem. And we will do something in EV & climate. The government plans to establish certain guardrails for AI. What are your thoughts on that? Tarun: Anything that has the potential to fundamentally change how societies operate at some level will get regulated by the government. I think with AI, governments are actually being much more proactive because they are aware that this is an even more powerful technology, it’s moving even more rapidly and adoption of tools like ChatGPT has been massive. I think regulation is probably the right thing to do. It is also good because as investors, you get clarity upfront in terms of what are the guard rails. Investors from several key foreign countries have not been exempted from angel tax. Your take? Rajinder: In our case, given that a very large number of our LPs (limited partners) are actually global and leading country is the US, we actually chose to set up our fund in the US. As a result, we have been less impacted by these current change in regulations. But we understand that many other funds are working through these current set of regulations and I am sure there will be an answer that emerges such that FDI in this important sector keeps scaling. At the end of the day, India needs to be globally competitive in technology. Angel investors, VC funds are taking the highest risk in backing companies, founders. I am sure there will be an answer that the government and the industry collectively find because we can’t have funds not being able to operate and founders not being able to access capital at the early stage when the need for capital is the highest.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/will-focus-on-generative-ai-evs-vc-firm-matrix/articleshow/100779295.cms
2023-06-06,"AI reunites Beatlesâ€™ fab four for â€˜newâ€™ music, raises ethical concerns",AFP,"When the Beatles broke up more than 50 years ago, devastated fans were left yearning for more. Now, artificial intelligence is offering just that. From “re-uniting” the Fab Four on songs from their solo careers, to re-imagining surviving superstar Paul McCartney’s later works with his voice restored to its youthful peak, the new creations show off how far this technology has come — and raise a host of ethical and legal questions. “I’m sobbing! This is so beautiful!” read a YouTube comment for a fan-created AI cover of McCartney’s 2013 single,“New”, which features de-aged vocals and a bridge part “sung” by his great songwriting partner, the late John Lennon. Equally impressive is a version of “Grow Old With Me”, one of the last songs penned by Lennon, which was posthumously released after his 1980 murder and recently remade by an AI creator who goes by “Dae Lims”. . After the most influential band in history parted ways acrimoniously, fans were deprived of a final “happy ending”, said music YouTuber Steve Onotera. “So when we do get that reunion artificially yet convincingly created by AI,well, it’s surprisingly emotional”. Like an earlier track called “Heart on a Sleeve” whichfeatured AI-generated vocals of Drake and The Weeknd and racked up millions of hits, thesecovers use scraping technology that analyses and captures the nuances of a particular voice. The creators would have probably then sung the parts themselves and then applied the cloned voice, in a manner similar to placing a filter on a photo. While the results can be astonishing, getting there isn’t simple and requires skilled human operators combining new AI tools with extensive knowledge of traditional music processing software, Zohaib Ahmed, the CEO of Resemble AI, a voice cloning company, said. For the music industry, the ramifications are enormous. As the technology progresses, software that will easily allow people to transform their vocals into one of their favourite singers is likely not far away. “If they’re getting paid for their vocal license, hey, everyone’s happy,” said Onotera. “But what if they’re long since passed away? Is it up to their estate?” AI is already proving a helter-skelter impact on the copyright world. In the case of “Heart on a Sleeve”, Universal Music Group was quick to assert copyright claims and have the track pulled down from streaming services, but that hasn’t stopped it popping back up on small accounts.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/ai-reunites-beatles-fab-four-for-new-music-raises-ethical-concerns/articleshow/100779880.cms
2023-06-05,Donâ€™t take that AI-powered bait,TNN,"Tempting and useful they may be, but AI-based chatbots and large language models are becoming potential gateways for fraud and intrusive data gathering. And it is getting bigger and scarier every day. Experts gathered at the first interactive series called ‘Hacked’, a cybercrime awareness drive for residential societies in Ahmedabad organized by the The Times of India and the cyber cell of Gujarat CID (crime) at Skydeck Select on IskconAmbli Road, revealed that cybercriminals are having a field day as AI-chatbots are allowing them to remove glaring grammatical and language mistakes from their fraudulent phishing emails and mobile texts. “AI-chatbots may have impressed us by helping us draft resumes or assignments in a matter of seconds. But it has empowered cybercriminals as well as they use it to draft highly realistic text, making it a useful tool for phishing purposes — impersonating the style of speech of specific individuals or victims,” warns Manish Thakar, a cyber evangelist, and chief information security professional with Hitachi Hi-Rel Power Electronics. During the hour-long session, Thakar along with inspector H P Pandya and subinspector Dhaval Shukal of the cybercell of Gujarat CID (crime) gave a broad introduction to types of cybercrimes prevalent such as online threats, stalking, cy-berbullying, sextortion, hacking, fraud, phishing attacks, e-SIM swapping and others. “Better cyber hygiene of devices, presence of mind while interacting with strangers on the phone, via chat or email is crucial. Re-port cybercrimes to police on the 1930 helpline in the first hour,” said Pandya. Rupin Shah, a resident of Skydeck Select, said, “Over the last several months many in my close circles had been complaining about ransomware attacks. The ‘Hacked’ session was informative on that front. I feel more such awareness drives should be conducted with families. ”Another resident Kruti Mahadevia added, “I sometimes face resistance while explaining to my parents that they need not click on links that appear in random SMSs with offers and freebies. This interactive session had been an eye-opener. ”Shukal added that informing the police of a cybercrime within the first hour helps freeze accounts of criminals before they withdraw the money. “Be it sextortion racket, credit card, KYC or OTP frauds, citizens need to change their mindset and report the cybercrime immediately. Cybercriminals thrive on the victim’s fear. Hiren Patel, a resident of Skydeck Select informed the experts of the frequent calls he has been getting from random international numbers. “The experts helped me identify characteristics of such fraud international calls. ” The experts also introduced the two broad types of ransomware strategies, those aiming to steal data and those aiming to inflict maximum damage in hope of a ransom payout. The experts added that cybercriminals are collaborating on the dark web to create new malware.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dont-take-that-ai-powered-bait/articleshow/100753080.cms
2023-06-05,"Civic body to bank on AI to remove craters, boost Mumbai's road safety",Sanjeev Devasia,"MUMBAI: To ensure that Mumbai's roads are free of potholes and to prevent accidents, the BMC is planning to transition from conventional monitoring and maintenance methods to advanced technology solutions based on LiDAR and AI-ML (artificial intelligence & machine learning). LiDAR, a popular remote sensing method used for mapping, will be employed to digitize the entire 2,050km road network of Mumbai. This digitization effort will encompass all road assets, including road utilities and furniture, effectively creating a digital road network asset bank. The digitized road network will then be utilized to monitor the condition of roads, with AI-ML employed to visualize road conditions on a GIS map. Citizens will also have the ability to report issues or grievances to the BMC through an app. According to a civic official, the condition of Mumbai's roads will be surveyed twice a year, before and after the monsoon, using an AI-ML-based application. This approach will enable the identification of road defects, which will be marked on a centralized map and visualized in five war rooms across the city. The identified defects will be communicated to officials and contractors through an app, allowing for prompt repairs. The war rooms and centralized system will be updated accordingly. TimesView Over the years, the civic body has spent large sums on maintaining roads, and yet failed to provide pothole-free roads. This despite the BMC experimenting with various technologies. Thus, while looking at new technologies, the BMC should ensure it does not lose sight of basic measures to ensure pothole-free roads. The LiDAR survey will generate point cloud data for the entire road network, including road carriageways, utilities, and furniture. The official explained that all road defects with an accuracy of up to 5cm and precision of 1mm will be identified. Based on road conditions, estimates for necessary repairs will be derived. The AI-ML system will also include videographing of the entire road network; it will get road roughness value at every 100 metres. While acknowledging the benefits of utilizing new technologies for finding solutions, former corporator Asif Zakaria emphasized the importance of effective implementation and execution by the BMC: ""The BMC should focus on implementation and execution. There is no harm in using new technologies for providing solutions.""",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/civic-body-to-bank-on-ai-to-remove-craters-boost-mumbais-road-safety/articleshow/100751930.cms
2023-06-04,Intâ€™l study helps AI model identify genetic causes of human diseases,U Sudhakar Reddy,"Hyderabad: Two new studies by global scientists, including researchers from city-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), have combined the genome sequencing of over 233 primate species. The research provides new information about primates’ genetic diversity and evolution, essential for understanding and conserving the biodiversity of the closest species to humans. Also, it has helped create a new AI algorithm with clinical applications to identify insights into the genetic causes of human diseases, using the primate genomic data. The Institute of Evolutionary Biology, Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona (Spain), Illumina, a genomics company based in California (US), and Baylor College of Medicine, Texas (US) have led a series of new global studies on primate genomes, which has been published in the journal ‘Science’. CCMB scientists, as Indian collaborators, also studied 83 samples from 19 major primate species. After generating the complete catalogue of genomic information for primates ever produced, the studies have compared the genomes of 809 individuals from 233 species of primates, which involved researchers from 24 countries. These studies have discovered DNA sequence variants and developed phylogenies (the history of the evolution of a species) for primate species that will provide new data on primate and human evolution, as well as primate biodiversity. The research has identified 4.3 million common missense mutations. Such mutations affect the composition of amino acids and can alter the function of proteins, leading to many human diseases. Rare missense mutations can raise the risk of disease “We have identified 6% of the 4.3 million missense mutations, and these are abundant in primates. We consider these to be ‘potentially benign’ in human diseases, given that their presence is tolerated in these animals,” said Kyle Farh , vice-president, Artificial Intelligence at Illumina. The identification of disease-causing mutations has been achieved thanks to PrimateAI-3D deep learning algorithm. PrimateAI-3D is an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm developed by Illumina. The algorithm is a kind of ChatGPT for genetics that uses genome sequence instead of human language. Reenergized insights into primate evolution and human uniqueness Govindhaswamy Umapathy , senior principal scientist, CCMB, whose group, including Shivakumara Manu and Mihir Trivedi , contributed to the research, said, “Primates have a great genetic diversity that varies between the different geographical regions and taxonomies. The study of this diversity is crucial for human evolutionary studies, human disease and their conservation.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/intl-study-helps-ai-model-identify-genetic-causes-of-human-diseases/articleshow/100736787.cms
2023-06-04,An AI clone could replace the indispensables at work,Bloomberg,"Every business has that employee it couldn’t stand to lose. The outstanding one. The one you joke about cloning. Well, the joke might one day be on us as the artificial intelligence boom gathers speed. And digital clones — avatars by another name — present a world of business, economic, scientific and artistic opportunities, even as they also raise a host of ethical questions. Avatars could well be the next big thing in the AI space, with avariety of industries eyeing them to boost productivity, cut costs and streamline operations including training, customer support, sales and communications. Investors have taken notice, with VC money pouring into what’s predicted to become a $527 billion industry by the end of the decade. London-based synthetic media platform Synthesia, is among the leaders, having raised $50 million and developed “human” avatars for over 15,000 companies, including McDonald’s Corp. , Accenture Plc and the UK’s National Health Service . Avatars can create greater efficiencies within an organization and be used to replace documents and presentations with more engaging videos, said a spokeswoman at Synthesia. At a cost of about $1,000 per avatar, the London-based firm even created a synthetic David Beckham , a copy of the former football star able to speak nine languages. Google-backed Runway and Deep Voodoo , popular for its special effects in a Kendrick Lamar music video, are also producing AI-powered human avatars. There is potentially a dark side, given the speed of technological advance and the almost complete absence of regulation or ethical guidelines. At risk of turning into “deep fake” machines, there is already a worrying history of such platforms releasing propaganda or outright lies, without accountability. Synthesia said it strengthened its regulations this year after one of its avatars was associated with the spread of misinformation.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/an-ai-clone-could-replace-the-indispensables-at-work/articleshow/100737075.cms

2023-06-02,AI to cut digital chores at work: Study,TNN,"Mumbai: The enormous volume of data, including emails and chats, that employees deal with everyday is hurting productivity. According to a Microsoft report, 83% Indians want to delegate as much work as possible to ‘co-pilot’ AI. “Every minute spent managing this digital debt is a minute not spent on creative work,” the 2023 Work Trend Index, which surveyed 31,000 people across 31 countries, said. Attempting to assuage fears about AI replacing jobs, the report stressed on the emergence of a new AI-employee alliance. While 74% of Indian workers say they’re worried AI will replace their jobs, Microsoft said that over three in four Indian workers would be comfortable using AI not just for administrative tasks (86%) but also for analytical work (88%), and even creative aspects of their role (87%). “This platform shift to AI is radically changing the way people are working, and while there’s some fear in the system, our data really shows that for many, the change is not really happening fast enough,” Microsoft India country head (modern work) Bhaskar Basu said at a panel discussion on the report. Basu added that as the pace of work and information overload accelerates, people are spending more of our day just separating the signal from the noise and all of this at the expense of creativity. “Now AI really promises to lift the burden as it really moves from autopilot to co-pilot and freeing us from digital debt and fuelling innovation,” he said. On how AI is shaping the workplace of the future, Persistent Systems head (delivery excellence & talent management) Merlyn Mathew said there is going to be a fusion of technology with human capability. “It’s moving into the era of co-pilot,” she said, while adding: “I would really look at generative AI as a superpower. It’s going to be a multiplier of human capability. This will help us unleash a lot new productivity, creativity and bring new skills to work. Some tasks will be automated, some will be assisted, freeing up people to do more important and creative things. There will also be new tasks that are created where humans need to intervene.” She added the impact of AI on productivity is yet to be fully understood. To bring people up to speed with the changing realities, the report said every employee needs AI aptitude, not just technology experts. However, Infosys executive VP and HR head Richard Lobo said people should be allowed time and space to learn the new technology. “If you don’t do that, we’ll probably miss the benefits which this technology will bring. Creating labs in our offices, creating spaces where people can innovate without having the burden of delivering output against demand, is something which every company should do because then you generate enough talent which will be ready for the future,” said Lobo. Lobo said companies should also allow people to experiment. “If we put people into silos, we will probably not succeed the way we should. We should focus on learnability. I think people across companies are very high on the learnability index. They will evolve and we should allow 30-40% freedom to evolve,” said Lobo. About 76% of Indian workers say they don’t have enough time and energy to get their work done, and those people are three times more likely to say they struggled with being innovative. About 78% of Indian workers agree that they lack uninterrupted focus during their workday.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ai-to-cut-digital-chores-at-work-study/articleshow/100686480.cms

Sitting in the front row of the Plug and Play auditorium along with Indian Overseas Congress chairperson Sam Pitroda and some other key aides who have been travelling with him from India, Gandhi was seen engrossed in the panel discussion of experts on various aspects of artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning and their implications on mankind in general and on issues like governance, social welfare measures and also disinformation and misinformation. Anurag Thakur: Rahul Gandhi's foreign trips insult India on foreign soil Based out of Sunnyvale in California, the Plug and Play Tech Centre is one of the largest incubator of startups. According to its CEO and Founder Saeed Amidi, more than 50 per cent of the startups founder at Plug and Play have been Indians or Indian Americans. Amidi told PTI after the event that Gandhi has shown a deep understanding of the IT sector and his knowledge of latest and cutting edge technologies are quite impressive. Participating in a fireside chat with Amidi and Shaun Shankaran , founder of FixNix Startup, Gandhi tried to link all the technologies with the impact this would have on the common man in the remote villages of India. ""If you want to spread any technology in India, you have to have a system where power is relatively decentralized,"" he said in response to a question and then went on to share with the select group of invited entrepreneurs about his personal experience of drone technology and its regulation, which, according to him, ""faced massive bureaucratic hurdles"". Caste census would help to distribute power and wealth, says Rahul Gandhi Data, Gandhi said, is the new gold and countries like India have realized the real potential of it. ""There is need to have appropriate regulations on data safety and security"". However, on the issue of Pegasus spyware and similar technologies, Gandhi told the audience he is not worried about it. At one point of time he said he knows his phone is being tapped. And jokingly said, ""Hello! Mr Modi"" on his iPhone . ""I presume my iPhone is being tapped. You need establish rules with regard to privacy of data information as a nation and also as an individual,"" he said. ""If a nation state decides that they want to tap your phone, no one can stop you. This is my sense,"" he said. ""If the nation is interested in tapping phone, then this is not a battle worth fighting. I think whatever I do and work, is available to the government,"" he claimed.

2023-06-01,E-challans from today as AI traffic mgmt system kicks in,TNN,"Panaji: Goa police and the transport department will start issuing fines for traffic violations in the state capital using the artificial intelligence-based cameras and camera-mounted speed radars from Thursday, said transport minister Mauvin Godinho. Godinho, who handed over 10 speed radars to Goa police, said that the speed radars and the AI traffic management system are equipped with Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) software that can identify the owner of the vehicle and generate a challan for over speeding. “From June 1, the AI cameras that have been installed by PWD — they selected the agencies — will become operational. They had some hitch because of the high traffic flow, but now I think they have pulled up their socks. We will know who jumped the queue, the signal, or violated any traffic norm. These are high resolution cameras,” said Godinho. The speed radars can function during day and night and can track a vehicle upto a distance of 200m in good visibility. The transport department has procured 10 portable LaserTrac radars at a cost of Rs 73 lakh and the company that provided the radars has already trained Goa police personnel to use the equipment. Goa police now has 14 speed radars that can be deployed anywhere in the state to catch speeding motorists by surprise. “We are also in the process of procuring 70 alcometers and breath analysers, which should be here in two weeks or a month, and they will be handed over to the police,” said Godinho. He said that several measures are being taken to improve road safety and reduce the number of accident prone zones. Around 70 locations have been identified where motorists have been found speeding. “Road safety is important and it is high time that we took steps. We want to get discipline on the roads. In 2022, there were 3,007 accidents and 251 deaths, which is so high. Good roads does not mean driving at high speed and knocking down people. There are accidents everyday and this is a very unhappy picture,” said Godinho. He said that despite the higher fines imposed under the new MV Act, violators continue to speed and drive rashly. “Right now, implementation will be around Panaji, but we have identified 70 other locations based on data that we are analysing and where the cameras are required. This number will only increase and we will put cameras,” said Godinho. He also said that automated driving tests will be introduced in the near future.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/e-challans-from-today-as-ai-traffic-mgmt-system-kicks-in/articleshow/100659135.cms
2023-05-31,"AI chatbots may be fun, but they have a drinking problem",TNN,"Chatbots like ChatGPT are always drinking. In the course of a typical 20-50-question-long conversation they can down up to 500ml of water to cool their servers. They also have a massive carbon footprint – a result of their insatiable energy hunger. Richa Gandhi looks at the ecological impact of AI’s growing use, and some measures to mitigate it Just like organic life, artificial intelligence (AI) cannot exist without water. It uses water directly to cool its massive server rooms, and indirectly at the power stations that produce electricity for those servers. The total water consumption of AI is called its ‘water footprint’. Popular new AI tools like ChatGPT and BARD fall in the category of ‘large language models’ and have a huge water footprint. These models are trained on massive language datasets that are hosted on stacks of energy-hungry servers. Their operation produces a lot of heat, and even if the centres are located in a cold climate, cooling becomes necessary. Servers work best at 10-27 degrees Celsius, and to maintain this temperature range server farms employ large cooling towers. For every unit (kilowatt-hour) of electricity consumed by the servers, cooling towers use a gallon (3. 8 litres) of water. How Cooling Towers Work Cooling towers work on the same principle as traditional room coolers. When water evaporates, it absorbs heat from its surroundings and reduces the ambient temperature. The water vapour rises inside the cooling tower and is released into the atmosphere. As a result, the water used by data centres is lost and cannot be recycled. This is doubly problematic because cooling towers at data centres can use only clean fresh water. Say, from rivers and lakes. Seawater is not an option because its high salt content would cause corrosion, damaging sensitive equipment at the data centre. Carbon/Water Trade-Off Data centres located in countries such as Sweden and Finland use less water because of the naturally cooler conditions. But in the Asia-Pacific region, where a lot of the AI action is now concentrated, higher ambient temperatures push up the need for water. A research paper titled “Uncovering and Addressing the Secret Water Footprint of AI Models” points out there’s often a trade-off between carbon efficiency and water efficiency. You can generate more solar energy to run servers in the afternoon (so, smaller carbon footprint), but then you need more water for cooling as it is the hottest time of the day. “AI model developers may want to train their models during the noon time when solar energy is more abundant, but this is also the hottest time of day that leads to the worst water efficiency,”the research paper’s authors write, citing the example of LaMDA’s training in sun-drenched Nevada. LaMDA is Google’s AI-based conversation technology. In other words, adopting renewable energy can sometimes come in the way of water conservation. The challenge, then, is to find a way to balance carbon and water efficiencies through new approaches to sustainable AI. What Companies Are Doing Most AI companies have pledged to make their systems sustainable by 2030. One solution, the paper’s authors say, could be to run AI model training in different locations at different points in time. Microsoft says its data centres in Phoenix, Arizona, which hosted the training of GPT-3 andits advanced version ChatGPT4, saved water by using outdoor air to chill servers for most of the year. They otherwise cool through direct evaporation, which uses a fraction of the water required by other, more traditional, water-based cooling systems like cooling towers. Microsoft further plans to save a million litres of water daily by switching from conventional energy to solar energy from the “Sun Streams 2 Solar Project,” operated by its local partner Longroad Energy .

2023-05-31,"AI poses 'risk of extinction', industry leaders warn",Agencies,"STOCKHOLM: Top artificial intelligence executives including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on Tuesday joined experts and professors in raising the ""risk of extinction from AI"", which they urged policymakers to equate at par with risks posed by pandemics and nuclear war. ""Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war,"" more than 350 signatories wrote in a letter published by the nonprofit Center for AI Safety (CAIS). As well as Altman, they included the CEOs of AI firms DeepMind and Anthropic, and executives from Microsoft and Google. Also among them were Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio - two of the three so-called a""godfathers of AI"" who received the 2018 Turing Award for their work on deep learning - and professors from institutions ranging from Harvard to China's Tsinghua University . A statement from CAIS singled out Meta, where the third godfather of AI, Yann LeCun , works, for not signing the letter. The letter coincided with the US-EU Trade and Technology Council meeting in Sweden where politicians are expected to talk about regulating AI. Elon Musk and a group of AI experts and industry executives were the first ones to cite potential risks to society in April. The statement comes at a time of growing concern about the potential harms of AI. Recent advancements in so-called large language models - the type of AI system used by ChatGPT and other chatbots - have raised fears that AI could soon be used at scale to spread misinformation and propaganda, or that it could eliminate millions of white-collar jobs. Eventually, some believe, AI could become powerful enough that it could create societal-scale disruptions within a few years if nothing is done to slow it down, although researchers sometimes stop short of explaining how that would happen. These fears are shared by numerous industry leaders, putting them in the unusual position of arguing that a technology they are building - and, in many cases, are furiously racing to build faster than their competitors - poses grave risks and should be regulated more tightly. Recent developments in AI have sparked fears the technology could also lead to privacy violations, power misinformation campaigns, and lead to issues with ""smart machines"" thinking for themselves. AI pioneer Hinton earlier said AI could pose a ""more urgent"" threat to humanity than climate change. This month, Altman met with US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris to talk about AI regulation. In a Senate testimony after the meeting, Altman warned that the risks of advanced AI systems were serious enough to warrant government intervention and called for regulation of AI for its potential harms.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/ai-poses-risk-of-extinction-industry-leaders-warn/articleshow/100634466.cms
2023-05-31,Nvidia mcap tops $1 trillion with AI bet,Bloomberg,"Nvidia became the world's first chipmaker with a $1-trillion market capitalisation, joining the ranks of just five US companies with valuations that high. The stock rose 4% early on Tuesday, gaining a market cap of $1 trillion and joining the likes of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft in trillion-dollar valuations. Fewer than 10 companies globally have ever achieved this level. No other company embodies Wall Street's current obsession with AI more than Nvidia. It has become the world's biggest maker of the specialised chips needed to power a new generation of artificial intelligence (AI) products, surpassing AMD and Intel in capability just as the viral success of ChatGPT has virtually every company around the world baking AI into its operations. In a speech at the National Taiwan University over the weekend, CEO Jensen Huang shared the philosophy that has brought his company to this moment: ""Run, don't walk,"" he said. ""Either you are running for food, or you are running from becoming food."" Huang's urgency and his willingness to take risks that other rule-by-committee businesses dare not is what compelled Nvidia, the Silicon Valley chipmaker he founded 30 years ago, to make big bets on AI years before anyone else was taking it seriously. Today, it's proving to be the company's golden goose. Nvidia's shares have soared since last week when it gave an AI-fuelled sales forecast that shattered Wall Street's estimates. The stock continued to gain on Tuesday after announcing several new AI-related products over the weekend that touch on everything from robotics to gaming to advertising and networking. Huang also unveiled an AI supercomputer platform that will help tech companies create their own versions of ChatGPT.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nvidia-mcap-tops-1-trillion-with-ai-bet/articleshow/100634332.cms

The special investigation team ( SIT ) probing the leak, has found that one of the accused used the latest AI technology to get answers after he accessed the question papers for recruiting assistant executive engineer (AEE) and divisional accounts officer ( DAO ). Top Picks For You ChatGPT 'fools' lawyer who now faces sanctions Teachers use software & instinct to detect ChatGPT in homework He then relayed the answers to aspirants using bluetooth earbuds while they were answering the exams. The SIT came to know of the startling details after they picked up Poola Ramesh , 35, a divisional engineer with Telangana State Northern Power Distribution Company Limited in Peddapalli. Ramesh got access to leaked question papers of at least three exams and used ChatGPT to get answers for two of them. According to sources privy to the investigation, Ramesh hatched an elaborate plan to feed answers to seven candidates sitting for two exams conducted on January 22 and February 26. He made all seven insert Bluetooth micro earpieces in their ear canal. A principal at the exam centre is believed to have snapped photos of the question papers and sent these to Ramesh 10 minutes after the exam started. Ramesh, who was sitting with four of his associates at another location, used ChatGPT to get correct answers and relayed them to the candidates. Each of the seven had allegedly agreed to pay Rs 40 lakh for helping them pass. Ramesh, however, did not need to use ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-training Transformer) for the assistant engineer (civil) exam on March 5 as he received the leaked question paper well in advance from Poola Ravi Kishore , a junior assistant in the electricity department, who is also a relative. “Ramesh sold the leaked question paper to more than 30 candidates for Rs 25 lakh to Rs 30 lakh each,” a police officer said. Ramesh hoped to make Rs 10 crore from more than 35 candidates including some government employees. By the time the lid was blown off the scam in early March, he had received about Rs 1.1 crore.

2023-05-28,Teachers use software & instinct to detect ChatGPT in homework,TNN,"KOLKATA: From using detectors to spotting missing keywords in projects and homework, teachers at schools and colleges are devising ways to ensure students carry out due diligence and use their analytical skills to complete their tasks instead of using only regenerative AI . Ever since the launch of ChatGPT , teachers have discovered that several students have been taking AI help tools to complete their assignments. Apart from sensitizing students on the mindless use of AI as it stunts analytical skills, some institutes are using anti-plagiarism and AI-detection software, while others are relying on the time-tested methods of familiarity with their students' skill sets. Anisha Sen , head of the English department at The Heritage College , said, ""When we detect a sudden change in a student's vocabulary or writing style, we check their sentences through AI detection tools or anti-plagiarism software. Most students are unaware if they write with AI help, it will show in AI-detection software."" Some teachers try to detect concepts and words which are ""often beyond the scope of a student's grade and knowledge"". ""In the homework of a class-X student, he had written on topics, such as geo-politics, something not taught in class,"" said the teacher at a south Kolkata school. ""Also the marked difference between their language skill in class and that in their home assignments makes it easier for teachers to spot instances of cheating. When students use AI tools, the points often stray from the topics discussed in class."" Teachers also look for identical answers as ChatGPT is an automated service, leading multiple students to write similar answers. Lady Brabourne College principal Shiuli Sarkar said, ""ChatGPT only provides information. Students are expected to be subjective and analytical. Students must know what they are writing about. This is where ChatGPT is ineffective."" Ambika Mehra, vice-principal at DPS New Town, said, ""We do not promote the use of these tools at all as it hinders a child's development.""",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/teachers-use-software-instinct-to-detect-chatgpt-in-homework/articleshow/100559649.cms
2023-05-26,AI frenzy pulls Wall Street higher despite US debt woes,AP,"NEW YORK: Wall Street ’s building frenzy around artificial intelligence helped yank the stock market higher Thursday, even as worries worsen about political rancor in Washington. The S&P 500 rallied 0.9% after chipmaker Nvidia gave a monster forecast for upcoming sales as it benefits from the tech world's rush into AI. It helped the Nasdaq composite leap 1.7%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 35 points, or 0.1%. Because it’s one of Wall Street’s most valuable stocks, Nvidia's 24.4% surge was the strongest force pushing upward on the S&P 500. Its forecast of roughly $11 billion in revenue for the current quarter blew past analysts’ expectations for less than $7.2 billion. Nvidia’s stock has already more than doubled this year, and its total value is approaching $1 trillion. Stocks of other chip makers also charged higher after Nvidia described a race by its customers to put AI “into every product, service and business process.” Advanced Micro Devices gained 11.2%. Some Big Tech stocks rallied, adding to recent gains fueled by excitement about AI. The field has become so hot that critics warn of a possible bubble, while supporters say it could be the latest revolution to reshape the global economy. Microsoft gained 3.8%, and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, rose 2.1%. They helped lift indexes even as the majority of stocks fell on worries about the US government edging closer to a possible default on its debt. Washington could run out of cash to pay its bills as soon as June 1, unless Congress allows it to borrow more. The widespread expectation on Wall Street has been for Washington to reach a deal before it's too late, as it has many times before, because a failure would likely be awful for the economy. But bitter partisanship on Capitol Hill is hurting faith and trust in the government. Fitch said late Wednesday that it could downgrade the US government’s “AAA” credit rating. It said it still expects a resolution before the US Treasury runs out of cash, but it sees the risk of a mistake having risen. “The brinkmanship over the debt ceiling, failure of the US authorities to meaningfully tackle medium-term fiscal challenges that will lead to rising budget deficits and a growing debt burden signal downside risks to US creditworthiness,” Fitch said. In 2011, Standard & Poor’s cut its “AAA” credit rating for the United States following a similar political squabble about the debt limit. Another concern rests on exactly when the “X-date” deadline will hit for the US Treasury to run out of cash. While Isaac Boltansky, BTIG director of policy research, said he sees an 11th hour deal happening, “Washington is still arguing over exactly when midnight hits, which remains our primary concern as deadlines are the only viable forcing mechanism in town.” On the losing end of Wall Street was Dollar Tree, which fell 12%. The retailer reported weaker profit than analysts expected for the latest quarter. ustomers are shifting spending toward less profitable products, and it's also contending with worse-than-expected theft like other retailers. All told, the S&P 500 rose 36.04 points to 4,151.28. The Dow slipped 35.27 to 32,764.65, and the Nasdaq gained 213.93 to 12,698.09. In the bond market, yields rallied after reports suggested the economy is in stronger shape than feared. One said fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected. That’s a signal the job market remains remarkably solid, even as manufacturing and other areas of the economy slow under the weight of much higher interest rates. Another report estimated the US economy grew at a 1.3% annual pace in the first three months of the year, stronger than the 1.1% earlier thought. That report also suggested inflation was a touch hotter during the start of 2023 than earlier thought. The stronger-than-expected data helped dampen investors' fears about a coming recession. But it could also convince the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again next month. Traders are split on whether the Fed will take a pause in June after hiking rates at a furious pace for more than a year. Higher rates have helped inflation to slow from its peak last summer, but they do that by slowing the entire economy and dragging on prices for stocks, bonds and other investments. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to track expectations for Fed action, jumped to 4.53% from 4.38% last Wednesday. The 10-year yield rose to 3.81% from 3.74%. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans. Stock markets abroad were mostly weaker, but the declines were milder than the prior day’s. Germany’s DAX lost 0.3% after data showed its economy shrank in the first three months of the year, the second straight quarter that’s occurred. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1.9% amid worries China’s economic recovery after the government relaxed pandemic restrictions is losing steam. Stocks in Shanghai slipped 0.1%.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/ai-frenzy-pulls-wall-street-higher-despite-us-debt-woes/articleshow/100514986.cms
2023-05-26,"Over 100 Kolkata HS schools apply to start AI, data science courses",Poulami Roy,"KOLKATA: More than 100 Higher Secondary schools in the city and suburbs have expressed their keenness to introduce new-age subjects artificial intelligence and data science from the current academic session. The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education is planning to organise a training programme for them next month. The Council had earlier asked schools interested in introducing these subjects to send applications. The response, say officials, has been overwhelming with more applications pouring in every day. The two subjects will figure for the first time in the 2025 HS exams. The Council is expected to publish a proper syllabus and sample questions for classed XI and XII soon. ""The number of applications we are receiving is beyond expectation since these subjects have just been introduced,"" said Council president Chiranjib Bhattacharya, adding that the interest is primarily among schools in Kolkata and adjoining areas. Sources said the two new subjects have been included in 'set one' of papers, where students can choose between physics or nutrition, chemistry or economics, mathematics or psychology, biological science, statistics or geography, computer science or computer application or environmental science. Schools will be eligible to teach the two subjects only if they have approved computer science teachers. ""We received several queries from students on these two subjects. We have proper infrastructure and teaching staff to include these,"" said Subhrojit Dutta, headmaster of Hindu School, which is among the schools that have applied to the board. 'We can't ignore technological development' Jodhpur Park Boys' School and Jadavpur Vidyapith are two city schools that are keen on introducing new-age subjects artificial intelligence and data science from this academic session and have sent in their applications to the HS Council.

2023-05-25,Govt in talks to regulate AI tech: Chandrasekhar,TNN,"NEW DELHI: The government has started consultations around the kind of guardrails it wants to put in place for artificial intelligence (AI) technology, minister of state for electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar said. ""We have our own views on how AI should have guardrails. And, that consultation has already started and in the DIA (Digital India Act), there is a whole chapter that is going to be devoted to emerging technologies, which are not just AI only...but AI in particular and multiple other technologies on how we would regulate them through the prism of user harm,"" Chandrasekhar told reporters here on the sidelines of the CII startup summit. The first draft of the Digital India Bill is expected to be released in the first week of June, the minister had said earlier this week. His comments come at a time when there's a broader industry discourse around the need to regulate AI, a technology which has made its way into a spate of industries and with the advent of new tech tools like generative, AI has only expanded its coverage, triggering concerns around user safety and privacy. Responding to questions around a recent blog by Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT where he suggested that something like an IAEA ( International Atomic Energy Agency ) for advanced AI is worth considering, the minister said ""if there is eventually a United Nations of AI as Sam Altman wants, more power to it, but that does not stop us from doing what is right to protect our digital nagriks and keeping the internet safe and trusted,"" Chandrasekhar said. Chandrasekhar said the Indian economy is no longer captive to just a few conglomerates. Today, there are scores of startups that are creating jobs, wealth, economic opportunities and contributing to the growth of the GDP. ""Entrepreneurship, startups are a fundamental part of the Indian economic architecture and design.""",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-in-talks-to-regulate-ai-tech-chandrasekhar/articleshow/100487587.cms

2023-05-24,Infosys launches generative AI services suite,Shilpa Phadnis,"BENGALURU: Infosys has launched a suite of AI services using generative AI that it says will augment human capabilities and open new opportunities in the enterprise space. Infosys Topaz , as it is called, leverages the company's AI framework to help customers build an AI core to deliver cognitive solutions. “It’s our collective knowledge, services, and the ecosystem of partners that we work with that we will bring to bear for our clients. Our clients need a lot of advisory capability around it. One of the first things that we are doing which Nandan ( Nilekani ) himself is championing is an AI-first approach within the organisation, and we're going to bring in those learnings into our Topaz offerings, because harnessing generative AI needs a lot of experience,” Infosys EVP and co-head of delivery Satish HC told TOI. A recent Goldman Sachs report said generative AI could boost economic output by $7 trillion globally over the next ten years. US investment management firm Ark Invest said AI software could generate $14 trillion in revenue by 2030. “Even without generative AI, the market was about $400-$500 billion. This is a high-growth opportunity and AI is at the heart of everything that we do. We're building digital twins for ourselves. One of the biggest challenges in the industry today, not just for us but even for our clients, is the aging workforce, institutional knowledge that is sitting within teams, and how we harness it without losing it. With generative AI now, we have an answer. Second, we are heavily invested in a core team,” Satish added. Satish noted that for a customer, they had been using machine learning algorithms that can understand emotions and sentiments around their products during sporting events. ""With ChatGPT, we've figured out that we can do this with 30% less effort. In some of these cases, we're going to use ChatGPT because it’s going to work on data which is already there in the public domain in social media. Now, in many other cases, we will have to build a custom module, or a large database bordered within the confines of a company because it's got competitive knowledge,” he said. A British bank, he said, used Infosys Topaz to transform over 2,000 customer service processes to operate in near real-time instead of a week. Infosys has over 12,000 AI use cases, 150 pre-trained AI models and 10 AI platforms steered by AI and data strategists. It says it has embraced a responsible by design approach that ensures trust, privacy, security, and compliance. Satish said that Infosys has built a risk framework around it and captured generative AI projects in the master service agreement (MSA) to mitigate any downside impact. “Contractually, every place where we are experimenting with this technology, we only do this with the explicit concurrence and approval from our clients and it goes into the MSA . That's because of the indirect risks which are open-ended. Second, when we take our service, whether it is 95% accuracy, whether it is 75% accuracy, the balance, we underwrite. Like the example I shared on 30% productivity gains with ChatGPT, it has given me a cycle time and effort savings. Of course, there may be a rough edge, but we will continue to fine-tune the models.

2023-05-23,"OpenAI CEO on how ChatGPT like AI can be regulated and ""governance of superintelligence""",TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"We are in the midst of an AI boom. Artificial intelligence has been gathering steam for a while now and it seems like all anyone can talk about is the role it will play. All the AI chatter has got governments and authorities worried and there is talk of regulating AI. Not just governments but the likes of Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk have also been extremely vocal about the need of regulating AI. Joining them is none other than Sam Altman , CEO of OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT . Altman , along with two other senior OpenAI executives, Greg Brockerman and Ilya Sutskever penned their thoughts on “superintelligence” in a blog post. “In terms of both potential upsides and downsides, superintelligence will be more powerful than other technologies humanity has had to contend with in the past,” Altman noted in the blog post. Special treatment and coordination needed OpenAI believes that there needs to be some degree of coordination “among the leading development efforts to ensure that the development of superintelligence occurs in a manner that allows us to both maintain safety and help smooth integration of these systems with society.” The company believes that governments could set up a project that companies can become part of. Apart from that Altman and OpenAI also feel that there needs to be an agency to keep a check on AI developments. “Any effort above a certain capability (or resources like compute) threshold will need to be subject to an international authority that can inspect systems, require audits, test for compliance with safety standards, place restrictions on degrees of deployment and levels of security, etc,” the blog post noted. Not a surprise but OpenAI believes the potential of AI is tremendous. “Given the picture as we see it now, it’s conceivable that within the next ten years, AI systems will exceed expert skill level in most domains, and carry out as much productive activity as one of today’s largest corporations,” the company executives said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//gadgets-news/openai-ceo-on-how-chatgpt-like-ai-can-be-regulated-and-governance-of-superintelligence/articleshow/100432942.cms
2023-05-23,"TB to cancer, AI booster for Mumbai public health system",Malathy Iyer,"MUMBAI: In 2022, civic health officials found that an artificial intelligence-back software detected tuberculosis in some people months before the disease’s tell-tale symptoms such as coughing emerged. “Of the 1,050 people diagnosed with TB by artificial intelligence (AI) in 2022, 35% were asymptomatic. It was helpful that they were identified before they could spread the disease in the community,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare . Now, Qure.ai, the city-based startup that fitted the AI software in nine BMC hospitals and a mobile van, wants to update the programme to detect lung cancer as well. “Our AI-enabled chest X-ray solution for TB screening can also be used to screen for other abnormalities such as lung nodules that could be indicative of cancer,” said Qure.ai founder Prashant Warier . “So, we will explore a partnership with the BMC to target lung cancer by expanding our programme in locations where AI-based TB screening is already active,” he said. Dr Gomare said it would be useful if the same algorithm used for TB could be used to detect lung cancer as well. Talk on AI is dominated by chatbots such as ChatGPT, Bing or Bard, but senior endocrinologist Dr Anoop Misra believes AI is leading a “revolution” in healthcare. From picking up trends, analysing results and helping with research writing, AI is fast becoming a part of medicine. As the editor of ‘Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews’, an indexed medical journal, Delhi-based Misra has already led and edited reviews on AI-based tools in medicine. “There is a huge potential with AI in every branch of medicine, be it radiology, ophthalmology or multiple clinical fields,” he said, adding that physicians who cannot understand AI “will be left behind”. Across the world, multiple studies are underway to check if and how AI and Big Data can further help medicine. In Zydus Hospital in Ahmedabad and Aster MIMS in Kozhikode, Warier’s AI-based stroke management programme is leading to quicker diagnosis of stroke. “Our apps help clinicians and Medtronic India is helping hospitals with training and solutions,” he said. Over a week back, a research paper in ‘ Nature Medicine ’ highlighted that an AI-based programme could detect pancreatic cancer, which is most difficult to catch in its early stages, at least three years in advance. The joint study by Harvard University and the University of Copenhagen used patients’ medical records for the prediction. But not all are impressed as yet. According to Dr Shailesh Shrikhande, deputy director at Tata Memorial Hospital and a pancreatic cancer surgeon, “AI currently depends on big data in various algorithms. If the data is of good quality, then we can get good inference and information,” he said. However, accessing high quality data is not easy especially when an algorithm needs tens of thousands of data points. “If we have an AI tool based on high quality data, it would definitely serve as a complimentary guide for doctors,” said Dr Shrikhande. At the moment, however, there is no pancreatic cancer AI-based algorithm that can be used for the general public. In their conclusion in the Nature Medicine article, the researchers said their results would help “design realistic surveillance programs for patients at elevated risk” of pancreatic cancer. “It cannot be used as a general screening tool as yet,” Dr Shrikhande pointed out. Warier, too, said that most concerns regarding AI in healthcare originate from the need for “unbiased” and “secure handling of patient data”. “AI is not a replacement to healthcare providers, instead it is an effective tool to augment their efforts,” he said. Dr Misra concurred: doctors have to use their judgement and experience to interpret AI data at the moment. “Nothing is 100% yet,” he added.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tb-to-cancer-ai-booster-for-mumbai-public-health-system/articleshow/100431727.cms

2023-05-21,Medical marvel: AI can go where humans canâ€™t,Anuja Jaiswal,"Image used for representational purpose only NEW DELHI: Artificial intelligence (AI), despite the obvious anxieties about its capacity to create job losses, is slowly and steadily gaining ground in the medical world. Doctors say AI has truly revolutionised the medical field and changed the way healthcare is approached. Dr Rajeev Kumar, professor of urology and associate dean of academics at AIIMS Delhi, said that AI had future potential use in medicine and healthcare. “AI is already being used for interpretation of images like X-rays, CT scans, MRI, etc., because it is easy to train AI tools to read images,” he said. “It is quicker and more consistent than humans at triage because humans might not appreciate all features of every image, particularly when the turnaround time has to be short, but AI has been trained to look at all those features.” In fact, AI algorithms are often able to pick up features that humans cannot even read. “While evaluating images, there could be a difference of opinion among physicians. Machines, in some such cases, may be able to resolve the difference because of their consistent algorithms,” said Kumar. He added, “As of now, we are not dependent on AI to make a diagnosis, but we use its features.” The only form of AI currently used in urology is in nomograms and algorithms to predict the possible outcomes of patients suffering from the disease. However, AI is expected to have a major role in the future, particularly in the reporting of MRI for prostate, bladder and kidney cancers, suggesting treatment options and predicting outcomes for diseases. “AIIMS Delhi has been designated a Centre of Excellence for AI in healthcare by the Union health ministry. The faculty of the departments there have started projects in three broad areas using image recognition: radiology (evaluating chest X-rays), dermatology (skin lesions) and ophthalmology (corneal and retinal lesions). We hope these tools will be ready soon for deployment,” said Kumar. Dr Meinal Chaudhry, director, radiodiagnosis and intervention radiology, Aakash Healthcare, explained where AI has advantages. “With the help of AI, we can check the quality of an image whether it is reportable or not, which means even when the image is poor we don’t have to recall the patient again for another imaging. This is a huge value addition for the patient,” said Chaudhry. The second advantage of AI, Chaudhry added, was the prioritisation of critical X-ray reporting. “AI can tell us which cases are critical and need immediate attention because they might be life threatening,” she said. She said AI can also analyse the trends of the previous X-rays. When a patient comes to the radiology department for X-ray, an AI software will see all images taken earlier too and prompt if something appears noticeable. Explaining this, she gave the example of the detection of life-threatening pneumothorax, when the air collects in between the parietal and viscera pleura resulting in the lungs collapsing. Sometimes some air leaks into the pleural cavity and collapses the lung, so there is a very thin line between normal air intake and pneumothorax. “AI can prompt an alert to the radiologist if a pleura is there and get it diagnosed as soon as the X-ray is taken. It is definitely a lifesaving algorithm,” said Chaudhry. AI is being used for preventive health check-ups like chest X-ray and spine MRI, said Kabir Mahajan, associate director of Mahajan Imaging. “If an X-ray report is normal and processed by AI, it automatically sends a report to the radiologist, who either accepts it or edits the report. But if AI detects something abnormal, it puts markers on the X-ray so that the radiologist knows what to look out for or consider,” said Mahajan. This helps the radiologist arrive at a more informed decision when writing his final report. AI is also being used in CT scan, reducing the scan time to 30% without compromising on the quality. “The scan is done within 10 mins, providing less discomfort to patients and also allowing the hospitals to conduct more scans in a day,” said Mahajan. “We have been doing this since 2019 but in different formats. Through AI, we are picking up more abnormalities but the price of tests remains the same for patients and they are getting more value for their money.” Dr Mohinish Chhabra, director, gastroenterology, Fortis Hospital, Mohali, said that AI was useful in the screening of colorectal cancer, which is the fifth leading cancer in India and claims several lives every year. He said, “We were the first to launch an AI screening device to detect pre-cancerous growth called polyps/adenomas, which usually take 10-15 years to become cancerous. So, if polyps are detected and removed at an early stage, the risk of cancer decreases by up to 90% and the probability of early death goes down.” The gastroenterologist said that it had been estimated that 55-60% of all cancer cases of this type occurred due to polyps missed by a colonoscopy. “AI is a boon in colon cancer screening as this tool doubles the detection of polyps measuring less than 10mm. They can be identified and removed during the colonoscopy procedure,” he said. There are a few cancers in the body that can be prevented. These include cervical and colon cancer. Other cancers can be detected early like breast cancer but only after it has developed. So the major difference is in detecting an early cancer and detecting pre-cancer which can later turn into cancer. Dr Sajjan Rajpurohit, director medical, oncology, Max Superspeciality Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, said AI technology had made a significant transformation in precision medicine. “AI technology has made it simpler to identify the efficacy of drugs for individual patients. In the field of oncology drug discovery, AI has enabled the identification of patients with specific genetic mutations, allowing targeted drug treatments,” explained Rajpurohit. He added, “Besides, AI tools aid doctors in predicting patient outcomes, enabling them to make tailor treatments for better results. Early detection is crucial in cancer treatment, and AI-enabled mammograms and metabolomics-based blood sample analysis are proving vital in detecting breast cancer early. With AI technology making healthcare more accessible, efficient and effective, the future of medicine looks brighter than ever before.” Gynaecologist Rahul Manchanda at PSRI Hospital, said AI was being used in many fields including gynaecology and women’s health. “The data fed in the computer and machines helps in forming algorithms to diagnose complex problems and then treat them with precise management through minimally invasive surgical techniques and robotic surgery,” said Manchanda. ‘Since all endoscopic and robotic surgical techniques involve computers as an image transfer system, deep learning methods help with more precise surgery with these systems.” AI incorporation helps in minimally invasive surgical techniques like laparoscopy and hysteroscopy being more precise. AI guides doctors in avoiding complications and hence promise better results of surgery for the patient and better patient outcomes. However, robotic surgery goes one step further with AI improving the range of movement and the preciseness. This decreases complications and blood loss further. Robotic surgery is, of course, ergonomic for the surgeon too because he or she can sit comfortably in front of a computer screen guiding the robot precisely.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/medical-marvel-ai-can-go-where-humans-cant/articleshow/100386391.cms
2023-05-21,Can AI-backed tuberculosis software help detect lung cancer too?,Malathy Iyer,"MUMBAI: In 2022, BMC health officials found that an artificial intelligence-backed software detected tuberculosis in some people months before the disease's tell-tale symptoms such as coughing emerged. Now, Qure .ai, a city-based startup that fitted the AI software in nine BMC hospitals and a mobile van wants to update the programme to detect lung cancer as well. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said, ""Of the 1,050 people diagnosed with TB by AI in 2022, 35% were asymptomatic. It was helpful that they were identified before they could spread the disease in the community."" ""Our AI-enabled chest X-ray solution for TB screening can also be used to screen for other abnormalities like lung nodules that could be indicative of cancer,"" Qure.ai founder Prashant Warier said, adding, ""We'll explore a partnership with BMC to target lung cancer by expanding our programme in locations where AI-based TB screening is active."" City startup Qure.ai, which is helping the BMC with AI-backed software for early detection of TB cases, is exploring a tie-up with the civic body to target lung cancer too. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said it would be useful if the algorithm used for TB could also be used to detect lung cancer. Talk on AI is dominated by chatbots such as ChatGPT, Bing or Bard, but senior endocrinologist Dr Anoop Misra believes AI is leading a ""revolution"" in healthcare. From picking up trends, analysing results and helping with research writing, AI is fast becoming a part of medicine. As the editor of 'Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews', an indexed medical journal, the Delhi-based Misra has already led and edited reviews on AI-based tools in medicine. ""There is a huge potential with AI in every branch of medicine, be it radiology, ophthalmology or multiple clinical fields,"" he said, adding that physicians who cannot understand AI ""will be left behind"". Across the world, multiple studies are underway to check if and how AI and Big Data can further help medicine. In Zydus Hospital in Ahmedabad and Aster MIMS in Kozhikode, Warier's AI-based stroke management programme is leading to quicker diagnosis of stroke. ""Our apps help clinicians and Medtronic India is helping hospitals with training and solutions,"" he said. Over a week back, a research paper in 'Nature Medicine' highlighted that an AI-based programme could detect pancreatic cancer, which is most difficult to catch in its early stages, at least three years in advance. The joint study by Harvard University and the University of Copenhagen used patients' medical records for the prediction. But not all are impressed as yet. According to Dr Shailesh Shrikhande, deputy director at Tata Memorial Hospital and a pancreatic cancer surgeon, ""AI currently depends on big data in various algorithms. If the data is of good quality, then we can get good inference and information,"" he said. However, accessing high quality data is not easy, especially when an algorithm needs tens of thousands of data points. ""If we have an AI tool based on high quality data, it would definitely serve as a complimentary guide for doctors,"" said Dr Shrikhande. At the moment, however, there is no pancreatic cancer AI-based algorithm that can be used for the general public. In their conclusion in the Nature Medicine article, the researchers said their results would help ""design realistic surveillance programs for patients at elevated risk"" of pancreatic cancer. ""It cannot be used as a general screening tool as yet,"" he said. Warrier, too, said that most concerns regarding AI in healthcare originate from the need for ""unbiased"" and ""secure handling of patient data"".

2023-05-19,Insurance companies turn to AI tools to process claims,Yogesh Kabirdoss,"Chennai: From processing claims to fraud detection and facial recognition, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made inroads into multiple facets of the insurance sector. Despite insurance companies exploring AI tools over the past decade, it has gained significant momentum in recent years. AI is playing a key role in decision making, risk mitigation, quick customer on-boarding and faster claim resolutions, while reducing costs. Digital life insurance company Aegon Life is pilot-testing facial recognition technology to identify gender, age and general well-being and helps in validating information already provided by customers. Cholamandalam MS General Insurance Company Ltd is engaging AI in its motor claims servicing through an application for motor damage assessment and claims settlement, wherein 94% of motor claims are settled through this application. Shriram Life Insurance Company (SLIC), which has about 45% of its retail premium being sourced from rural areas, uses AI and digital technology for retail claims management. “We use technology to analyze historical claim data, identifying patterns to effectively manage claims. With AI-based predictive models, we can anticipate claim trends and provide proactive service to policyholders and nominees,” SLIC MD and CEO Casparus J Kromhout said. Such initiatives have reflected in rapid claim settlement, which includes settling of non-investigated claims within 12 hours even for the remotest of regions, he added. The company started engaging AI tools in the past five years and using it across many areas of businesses, which is approximately 30%-40% of the processes. Leading standalone private health insurer, Star Health and Allied Insurance Company Limited, says auto adjudication of claims using AI/Machine Learning (ML) based tools for digitisation and automation has helped in drastic improvement of turnaround time. Its MD & CEO Anand Roy said, 65% of cashless claims evaluation are processed using automation engine. “Last year, we’ve seen a significant increase in auto adjudicated claims. About 50% of our teams and departments use AI & ML based tools for customer experience improvements, efficiency enhancement and cost optimisation,” he added. SBI General Insurance underscores that AI has the potential to revolutionize the insurance industry, making it more efficient, effective, and customer-centric. “The implementation of AI has proven highly effective enabling us to enhance our operations, reduce costs and deliver better service to our customers,” said Pankaj Kumar Pandey, chief information officer, SBI General Insurance. On the other hand, K V Dipu - senior president & head-operations & customer Service, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance emphasises that the human factor remains crucial in the Indian insurance industry in areas such as customer relationships and claims assessment in the age of AI. “While AI and automation technologies have made significant advancements in streamlining processes and improving efficiency, human involvement remains essential for certain aspects,” he said. More than 95% of the company's policies are issued digitally with the help of AI and related tools.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/insurance-companies-turn-to-ai-tools-to-process-claims/articleshow/100342714.cms

The emergence of ChatGPT, Google’s Bard and a few live voice translation apps has created so much excitement among students and parents that BTech AI and data science courses have become the most preferred after computer science engineering this year. With colleges increasing their intake, around 16,000 students will be joining AI and data science courses in 2023-24. But the colleges are hardly ready to teach the rapidly developing and transforming field. Most engineering colleges do not have trained faculty members to teach AI. Whether the graduates will be industry-ready when they pass out four years is hardly known. Students, under peer pressure, are already flocking to the highly specialized BTech course under management quota. Experts say that they should have application-oriented knowledge, exposure to data management and machine learning. Colleges say they will use live problems to teach AI and other emerging areas. Some colleges are developing courses with industry experts and foreign universities. “We have professors of practice from IT companies like Cognizant who train our students with live problems,” said Abhay Meganathan , vicechairman, Rajalakshmi Group of Institutions . Some colleges are encouraging their faculty members to enroll in online degrees, certificate courses and hackathons to get trained in coding skills and artificial intelligence. Experts say fundamentally there is not much difference between computer science engineering and AI. “Fundamentally, the curriculum will be common for these courses,” said Anna University vice-chancellor R Velraj . He also said AI will not take away jobs. “It will increase engineering jobs as we will need more engineers to deploy AI systems,” Velraj said. To tap the opportunities in emerging areas, Anna University plans to offer a chance to study AI, data science to all engineering students. “Colleges should teach students to solve real world problems to produce quality AI engineers. Students who want to become AI engineers, should be very good in programming,” said professor B Ravindran , head, Centre for Responsible AI, IIT Madras. He also assured that jobs will not be taken away. “AI is not mature to the point where you can replace humans completely with AI,” he added. Some experts warned against creating more seats in AI saying students from tier-2, tier-3 colleges will struggle to get jobs of their choice. “The number of jobs in AI has increased. But, not to the extent that educational institutions have increased their intake so on and so forth. Students - especially from non top-tier institutions - often struggle to get jobs of their choice after doing specialisation in AI,” said Shourya Roy, president, ACM India Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. AI CURRENTLY USED IN Movie recommendations on online streaming platforms including OTT Video recommendations on YouTube Food delivery apps use AI to predict expected delivery time Online shopping sites using AI for their operations to combine orders, selecting warehouses to ship products Ride hailing apps to predict travel time Virtual assistant devices and assistant apps HOW WILL IT BE DIFFERENT FROM THE COMPUTER SCIENCE CURRICULUM? Fundamentals are common for both computer science and AI. Students need to learn more continuous maths like probability theory, linear algebra, optimization. Students need to be strong in the fundamentals of maths and computing. AI engineering needs very good programming skills.

2023-05-17,India for international framework to regulate AI platforms like ChatGPT,TNN,"NEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday said it is considering a regulatory framework for AI-enabled smart tech platforms, such as ChatGPT, including areas related to bias of algorithms and copyrights. And, any law that will be framed will be drafted in conjunction with other like-minded nations, it added. Communications and IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said growing influence of AI platforms is being looked into by various countries, and thus a framework needs to be developed after international deliberations. ""The whole world is looking at what should be the framework, and what should be the regulatory setup. In G7, all digital ministers (of G7 countries) are seriously concerned about what should be the regulatory framework. So, this is a global thing. This is not one country's issue. This has to be looked at from the international perspective,"" Vaishnaw told TOI, adding ideas will continue to be exchanged among various countries. Asked about the concerns arising around AI chat platforms, such as ChatGPT, which use 'Generative AI' tools and give human-like intelligent responses within seconds, the minister said, ""There are concerns around IPR, copyright, bias of algorithm. There are many concerns. This is a vast field."" On whether the subject would require a separate regulation, Vaishnaw said it would flow into that direction. ""Ultimately, as I said, all the countries will have to come up with some co-operative framework."" ChatGPT, created by startup OpenAI, began services late last year and mopped up over a million users in just five days of its launch. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in the company. Microsoft has also integrated the technology into its own products, including search giant Bing. Google, whose ubiquitous search engine faces a stiff competition from tools such as ChatGPT that returns more real-world intelligent responses, instead of just a catalogue of internet links, is countering ChatGPT with its own generative AI tool Bard. ""Bard seeks to combine the breadth of the world's knowledge with the power, intelligence and creativity of our large language models. It draws on information from the web to provide fresh, high-quality responses,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai had said earlier this year. However, regulators around the world are concerned by the growing popularity, acceptance and use of such technologies as they may have the ability to mislead people, spread false and fake news, violate copyright laws, and even extinguish millions of jobs. European regulators are already looking to create laws to govern the smart technology and so is the US. On Tuesday, OpenAI (which makes ChatGPT) CEO Sam Altman told Congress that government intervention ""will be critical to mitigate risks of increasingly powerful"" AI systems. ""As this technology advances, we understand that people are anxious about how it could change the way we live. We are too,"" Altman testified at a Senate hearing.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-for-international-framework-to-regulate-ai-platforms-like-chatgpt/articleshow/100288776.cms

2023-05-16,iTNT Hub to help stateâ€™s AI mission,Sindhu Hariharan,"iTNT aims to help entrepreneurs working on AI, machine learning and block chain to ideate and scale CHENNAI: The iTNT ( Tamil Nadu Technology) Hub , which will anchor the state’s soon-to-be launched ‘AI mission’, was officially launched by chief minister M K Stalin here on Monday. The AI mission will define the artificial intelligence use roadmap for government departments as the state leverages the technology to improve e-governance. The iTNT Hub, an innovation and deep tech network set up within Anna University , will power it. The hub was first announced in the state budget 2022 with an allocation of 54.6 crore. It has already partnered with 19 startups across space tech, health tech and other areas. It aims to help entrepreneurs working on AI, machine learning and block chain to ideate and scale. “iTNT Hub is a one-of-its-kind centre in India that will work towards bringing Tamil Nadu in the top 10 innovation economies in the world by engaging with educational institutions, startups and large companies. While 50% of the funding is from the central government’s IT ministry, 37% is from the state government, and 13% from the corporate sector,” the state government said. Vijay Anand , CEO, iTNT Hub, told TOI that it would anchor the state’s e-Governance Agency in its AI mission, a three-year programme to use AI in eight focus areas to help the state lead in tech-enabled governance.

2023-05-12,"Google AI search vs Bard chatbot: How the two differ, how to access Bard in India and more",TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"At its annual conference in Mountain View, California, Google showed an updated core search product that embeds more artificial intelligence (AI) in its answers as the company looks to remove doubts that it is losing ground to Microsoft's OpenAI-powered Bing search. Google said that it has now embedded its latest AI technology into 25 products, including the search updates and a feature to help users write emails in Gmail . ""Seven years into our journey as an AI-first company, we are at an exciting inflection point,"" Sundar Pichai , Google's CEO, said at the conference. ""With generative AI, we're taking the next step, with a bold and responsible approach, we are reimagining all of our products."" The company has a Bard chatbot that competes with ChatGPT, the chatbot from OpenAI, but the company is not bringing it to its search. Google appears to be taking a more measured approach. The company did not include a chatbot, as they can pose the risk of making up false information, in its search engine. Instead, Google said it will use AI to provide some answers, which will be corroborated by authoritative websites, and it will also continue including ads in responses. The AI technology coming to Google search is called Search Generative Experience. When do users Google and when to use Bard The company said that traditional Google search should still be used for finding and seeking information, such as finding a place or looking for something to buy or a place to go. Bard is a chatbot with a persona that can hold human-like conversations. So it is intended to be used for creative collaboration, for example to write captions for a photo, welcome speech for an event or more such things. How is AI changing the Google search Google's home page will still look and act the way it is now, with that familiar search bar. The difference will be in the answers. This means that if the new Google detects that generative AI can be used to answer a query, the top of the results page will show the AI-generated response. The traditional links to the Web will remain below. For example, a search for ""weather Delhi"" will as usual point a user to an eight-day forecast, while a query asking what outfit to wear in a small Rajasthan city may prompt a long response generated by AI. Users will also be able to enter the new ""conversational mode,"" which is similar to Bard. Also like ChatGPT, it will remember the user's earlier questions so that they can ask follow-ups more easily. Google remains search engine, is not becoming a chatbot Google also points out that this conversational mode is not designed to be a chatbot with a personality. It is intended only to help improve search results. The responses will never contain the ""I"" phrase, unlike Bard and ChatGPT. Where to try the new Google search Internet users cannot yet use Google search with AI. US consumers will gain access to the Search Generative Experience in the coming weeks via a wait list. During thistrial phase, Google will monitor the quality, speed and cost of search results. How to use Bard in India At I/O 2023, Google announced that Bard is now available with no wait list in 180 countries and territories. Google’s conversational generative artificial intelligence chatbot Bard is being rolled out in over 180 countries, including India, the company announced. Initially, the Google Bard chatbot was only available in the UK and the US. Interested Indian users can now join the waitlist for the AI chatbot via the Google Bard official website.

2023-05-11,AI innovation helps Telangana chilli farmers get fast & accurate quality reports,Sribala Vadlapatla,"An AI-based moisture meter that helps ryots in checking crop quality HYDERABAD: Can artificial intelligence-based algorithms smell, taste and inspect agricultural produce in the same way that farmers or quality experts or traders do? That's about pretty much what the digital green project of Telangana's emerging technologies wing has managed with its pilot project for chilli crop in Khammam. The initiative is part of Saagu-Baagu (agriculture advancement), a first of its kind public-private partnership, in collaboration with the World Economic Forum ( WEF ), agritech industry and the start-up community under the state's AI4AI ( AI for Agriculture Innovation ) programme launched in 2020. The project in Khammam is assisting farmers, who are dependent on traders and exporters to decide quality and price of their crops, by providing superfast report via AI algorithms which check the physical, chemical and moisture parameters of the chilli crop. The test time for all three parameters is approximately 20-25 minutes per 100gm and the results are instantly shared with the farmer via SMS, displaying the tested parameter values and grade of the chilli as A, B, C, and D respectively. A quality test in a lab takes more than 24 hours, officials said. Subrath Kumar Panda , chief technology officer (CTO) of AGNEXT, a start-up that is providing Telangana government the AI solution, said that Visio Box , 7 SpecX Pro and 7 SpecX Connect are the three AI machines providing physical, chemical and moisture parameters for the chilli crop. ""Visio Box checks pod quality such as size, damage, insect infestation etc. With the help of human experts we took thousands of pictures capturing various characteristics of chilli and then programmed the Visio Box with the feedback. When we put chillies in the Box, it accurately predicts the quality outcome as a human expert with an accuracy of 98 %,"" Panda said. According to experts, technologies have advanced significantly in the AI sector over the last few years. ""As per many reports, between 2021 and now, technology companies, particularly start-ups, are expected to have invested more than $94 million in artificial intelligence projects. As a result, many changes will occur in the fields of medicine, education, financial services, construction and manufacturing, and agriculture,"" said L Maruti Shanker , MD of 7Seas Entertainment Limited and a technology expert.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ai-innovation-helps-telangana-chilli-farmers-get-fast-accurate-quality-reports/articleshow/100145236.cms

2023-05-08,Kooâ€™s new AI algorithm detects lots more offensive content,Veena Mani,"Bengaluru: Homegrown social media platform Koo has seen a large increase in the number of accounts it has blocked or banned on its platform since it deployed a new AI-based algorithm to detect abusive and sensitive content like nudity, violence, toxic content and impersonation. Koo deployed this feature in February. The algorithm has been able to detect almost four times more cases in a month compared to what it was prior to that. For instance, the app would earlier identify about 250 nude posts a month, but now that has gone up to 950. In February alone, 1,400 cases of violent content were removed, compared to just five in a month before implementation of the new system, Mayank Bidawatka, co-founder of Koo, told TOI. The AI-based algorithm not only automatically detects and removes objectionable content, but also blocks accounts from which such content is posted. These accounts will not be visible to any Koo user when searched for. The ban on such accounts happens within five seconds of the content being posted on the platform. “Our endeavour is to keep developing new systems and processes to proactively detect and remove harmful content from the platform and restrict the spread of viral misinformation,” Bidawatka said. The algorithm is also programmed to detect fake accounts. Earlier, there was a dedicated team for this purpose. Identification of impersonation accounts has gone up from 20 a month to about 400. For such categorisations, Koo looks at patterns in posts and photographs posted on an account, analyses the pictures and videos, and compares it with what is there on the web. With these features, the social media platform, which is in direct competition with Twitter , is trying to portray itself as a safe platform for users. This is all the more important as it now expands globally.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/koos-new-ai-algorithm-detects-lots-more-offensive-content/articleshow/100060943.cms

The opposition parties are providing all support to this, he alleged. The minister said the attempt is to defame the chief minister and his family. “The opposition wants to put the government in a bad light by unleashing baseless allegations. The agreement for the project was made in 2018. Till date no company has gone to the court against this project or raised any allegations against awarding the tender. Hence, all the allegations that have come up after the commissioning of the project were nothing but political,” he added. It is certain that no corruption has been involved in the project. The allegations are against the procedures that have been followed. If there are any procedural lapses occurred, then it would be clear soon after the inquiry conducted by the industries principal secretary. “Why is that those who are demanding a judicial probe into the deal not approaching the court? They are claiming that they have all the evidence to prove the corruption. Then they should approach the court,” Raju said. When the UDF was in power in 2012, an order for 100 cameras was made by the Keltron, for which Rs 40 crore was the cost. Keltron has followed the same procedures to purchase the cameras now, he added. Meanwhile, the minister said the motor vehicle department has started issuing warning notices under the Safe Kerala project and the fines will not be imposed now.

2023-05-07,Corruption in AI camera project runs to Rs 100 crore: VD Satheesan,TNN,"The UDF is demanding a thorough judicial inquiry into the deals related to the AI camera project KOCHI: Coming up with fresh allegations regarding the contract for the installation of AI cameras under 'Safe Kerala' project, opposition leader V D Satheesan said that there was corruption to the tune of at least Rs 100 crore in the project. Alleging that the chief minister's office played a role in awarding the contract, Satheesan said that the CM's relative attended the first meeting of the consortium of companies which was awarded the contract to install cameras. He said that all the official procedures for awarding the contract were illegal and the CM's office was directly involved in the processes. Releasing the documents on the financial proposal of Rs 57 crore submitted by Trois Infotech for the installation of AI cameras, Satheesan said that the contract for the project was finally awarded for Rs 151 crore and the government has lost around Rs 100 crore in the deal. ""The amount of Rs 57 crore itself is an exorbitant rate and the real cost for the installation is only around Rs 45 crore,"" he said. Satheesan said that the opposition is levelling allegations with the support of concrete evidence. ""We have evidence for the attendance of CM's relative at the first meeting of the consortium of SRIT, Presadio and Alhind. Presadio's owner is yet to deny the presence of the CM's relative at the meeting. We are ready to produce the evidence before any inquiry team,"" he said. He said that when the firm Alhind informed about the fraud in the deal, including the non-transparency of rates of materials to be procured, to the principal secretary of industries department in a letter in October 2021, the department did not take any action and the same officer who did not act on the complaint is now probing the deal, he alleged. The companies that won the first tender for the K-FON project are the same companies behind the AI camera scam. ""When a startup based in Thiruvananthapuram won the contract for K-FON project, Railtel and Akshara, which are associated to SRIT, have written to K-FON asking to cancel this tender.

2023-05-07,"â€˜AI no threat, need to use its unlimited potentialâ€™",TNN,"LUCKNOW: Elon Musk and some AI scientists have called for a sixmonth pause on developing more powerful AI tools, citing potential risks to society. In response, Bill Gates has said that halting the progress of AI would not solve the challenges. This new paradigm and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for largescale skilling in AI has forced policymakers to work on ‘AI literacy for all’. AI is ubiquitous – in online chess and video games, Alexa and Siri , Google maps and in our smartphones and smart watches. As AI pervades our home and work space, it is important to understand the technology, as well as myths, realities, apprehensions andenthusiasm around it. If we want to ensure that AI does not aggravate existing inequalities, it will be important to develop a clear understanding of AI – what it is, how it works and how it might impact on our lives. We call it basic AI literacy which will help citizens to live harmoniously in the age of AI and think critically and responsibly about their choices, rights and privileges. AI is the science and engineering of building intelligence into machines. AI refers to the ability of machines to perform cognitive tasks like computation, problem-solving, perceiving, learning and decisionmaking. Let us try to address some of the popular myths and apprehensions around AI. First, we look at the differences between AI and human intelligence. Every day we marvel at the performance of Alexa and Siri in finding patterns and data. But we also notice that it is not possible tohave a real in-depth conversation with these devices. They respond to specific commands only, and that too inaccurately at times. Now we look at what AI has done or can do in the fields of art, music and entertainment. A much talked about tool these days is ChatGPT. This is an example of machine learning where the software gets access to a huge database, learns a set of rules and uses them to generate new texts and poems as per the command given to it. The question is whether this can be called ‘creativity’. A few years ago, a computer designed a picture “the Next Rembrandt”, 351 years after Rembrandt’s death. AI scrolled through a database of 346 Rembrandt paintings, analysed them pixel by pixel and used deep learning algorithms to create a unique masterpiece, which did reflect the painter’s artistic identity. But the outcome was not classified as ‘creative’. An AI-generated music or picture is only an amalgamation of the database provided and does not involve any creativity. Creativity and self-directed learning is unique to humans. Machines can use man’s creations to produce marvellous works, but they lack the passion, feelings, beliefs, perceptions and talent of the original creator. They cannot perform the tasks which require ingenuity, creativity and emotional intelligence of humans. It is imperative to stop being afraid of AI. Creating apprehensionsaround AI will only hold us back. The potential to improve the world through AI is limitless, as long as we know how to steer it. We need to stop looking at it as an enemy and start looking at it as a tool to use. After Government of India has removed restrictions on development of technology and liberalised it, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has called upon the educational institutes and industry to upscale R&D and develop technology as per our needs. Work has commenced in UP for incorporating basic concepts and usage of AI in the curricula of all classes, adding relevant study material at appropriate places in various subjects. Effort is to evolve a strategy to enhance AI literacy across all sections of society, thus demystifying AI. (The writer is additional chief secretary in UP government.

2023-05-05,AI cam row: MVD not to sign deal with Keltron until state govt takes a stand on probe report,TNN,"Thiruvananthapuram: As the Safe Kerala project is embroiled in an ever-burgeoning controversy, the motor vehicle department has put in cold storage its earlier plans to start slapping fines on motorists caught in AI cameras for violation of traffic rules after May 20. The state motor vehicle department is learnt to have decided not to sign the final agreement with Keltron to launch the project. The agreement would be signed only after the probe by industries principal secretary into the AI camera deal is complete and the government takes a final call on the deal. Difference of opinion between MVD and the Keltron over spending of money prior to May 20 has also contributed towards putting the agreement in limbo, sources said. As per initial plans, the MVD was to strictly act against traffic violations, based on the data captured by AI cameras, by May 20. However, at that time, the punitive actions were being withheld following public protest citing practical difficulties endemic to the strict enforcement of rules. The move to slap a fine on two-wheeler riders if more than two people, including children, travel on two-wheelers had attracted severe public criticism. The Safe Kerala project envisages to detect traffic violations using AI cameras. Those who break the rules would first receive an SMS in their registered mobile number. E-challan for the payment of fine would then follow. This process would be made possible through the Parivahan software. When the state government decided not to implement the project at once but create an awareness first, MVD and Keltron wanted each other to bear the expense for sending notices to traffic violators as part of the awareness drive. This too contributed to the delay in signing the final agreement between MVD and Keltron. As many as 726 AI cameras were installed as part of the Safe Kerala programme. Vehicles that use beacon lights are exempted from the rules. The least fine is Rs 250, for unauthorised parking. The AI cameras generally detect speeding, travel without seat belt or helmet, use of mobile phone while driving, overload on two-wheelers and signal jumping.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ai-cam-row-mvd-not-to-sign-deal-with-keltron-until-state-govt-takes-a-stand-on-probe-report/articleshow/99999979.cms

Alleging that the chief minister is involved in one of the biggest scams the state has witnessed, opposition leader V D Satheesan said it was high time he spoke on the matter as serious allegations of the involvement of one of his close relatives in the project had been raised. He said it was strange that the chief minister and the other ministers were maintaining silence on the matter. The industries minister had initially defended the project but he had also gone quiet now, he said. The opposition had released documents proving corruption in the project but the chief minister did not even deny them. This is the last chance for him to come up with a response, Satheesan said. Satheesan said that the opposition was ready to release further proof on the matter. He demanded a judicial inquiry and said questions posed by the opposition should be included in its terms of reference. According to Satheesan, the corruption in the project began with a conspiracy among the government, Keltron and company SRIT India Pvt Ltd. The first fraud was to prepare a fake estimate of Rs 235 crore, quoting double the actual prices of cameras and allied equipment, to extort money. Despite a condition in the tender document that sub-contracts should not be given in major matters, the Keltron and SRIT entered into an agreement. The SRIT formed a consortium with Presadio and Al Hind, from which Al Hind backed out later. The SRIT then made another service agreement with a Hyderabad-based company, Ecentric, without the knowledge of Keltron. Keltron could have backed off from the agreement citing violation of conditions but it did not, he said. As per the GST documents, Ecentric submitted bills worth Rs 66 crore to SRIT. The amount spent for executing the project could be found out on examination of the GST bills, he said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cms-silence-sign-of-complicity-oppn/articleshow/99973912.cms

2023-05-03,"V D Satheesan , Ramesh Chennithala target Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan in AI camera row",TNN,"KOZHIKODE : Congress leaders on Tuesday trained their guns at chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan over irregularities in the artificial intelligence (AI)-based camera project, with opposition leader V D Satheesan saying that the allegations have reached the chief minister's doorsteps and former opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala alleging corruption to the tune of Rs 132 crore in the project. Satheesan told reporters in Kozhikode that the chief minister was running away from allegations about the project and challenged him to reply to the opposition charges, including those about his alleged relationship with Presadio Technologies. Even after we levelled the serious allegation that CM has links with the firm and that corruption in the AI camera project had taken place at the level of the CM’s office, the chief minister has not even issued a denial,” he said. Satheesan said all the subcontracts and purchase orders of projects bagged by firms like Uralungal society, SRIT that came first in the AI camera project and L2 bidder Ashoka Buildcon were being granted to Presadio. “What is the reason why all the work related to the government ends up with that firm? All the roads are ending up at a place where a casket is located and all the money is going into it. That company is Presadio. Even after we raised such serious allegations related to the firm and asked the CM to spell out his connection with that firm, he has not uttered a word,” he said. Chennithala, meanwhile, alleged serious irregularities in the tender proceedings of the project. “The CM has adopted a stand of not replying to serious allegations levelled by the opposition and protecting those involved in corruption. It was the chief minister who was behind the project, and he had knowledge about it,” he told the media in Kasaragod. The senior Congress leader said that the project that could have been implemented at Rs 100 crore was tendered for Rs 232 crore, thereby resulting in corruption of Rs 132 crore. Citing the technical evaluation summary report and the financial bid evaluation summary report, he asked how SRIT “with no previous experience in implementing such a project” was granted qualification in technical evaluation. He also sought to know how another company that was launched only in 2017 got qualified in the technical evaluation report without the mandatory 10-year experience in the field.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/v-d-satheesan-ramesh-chennithala-target-kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-in-ai-camera-row/articleshow/99945971.cms
2023-05-03,LinkedInâ€™s AI may write messages to hiring managers: How will it help candidates,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is spreading through the tech industry like wildfire. But, the technology in trend is like a double-edged sword. As AI-related scams rapidly increases, some tools are also helping people to reduce their workload. Just like several other tech companies, the business and employment-focused social media platform, LinkedIn has also started implementing AI in its services. The Microsoft-owned service is reportedly experimenting with a new generative AI feature for job seekers. According to a report by Engadget, the company is testing a new feature that will generate brief, cover letter-like messages for candidates. LinkedIn users who are looking for a job can send these messages to managers who are using this platform to hire resources. The report claims that the feature has already started rolling out now for the site's premium subscribers. How will it help users? Apart from showing available roles on the jobs page, LinkedIn will also offer users an option to “Let AI draft a message to the hiring team”. The company claims that this feature will extract “information from your profile, the hiring manager’s profile, the job description, and the company of interest” to create a “highly personalised” message. The company has also provided an example where the message reportedly reads like the opening few sentences of a cover letter. As per the report, the AI-written messages users see may vary depending on the amount of information available on each user’s LinkedIn profile. However, LinkedIn has recommended users double-check and edit the text before sending it. The company noted, “customisation is still important”. LinkedIn-owner Microsoft also backs ChatGPT creator OpenAI. So, the career-focused platform has already started experimenting with multiple other generative AI features. The platform has recently started offering AI writing suggestions for profiles. The “collaborative articles” on LinkedIn also use AI-written text.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//gadgets-news/linkedins-ai-may-write-messages-to-hiring-managers-how-will-it-help-candidates/articleshow/99947445.cms
2023-05-02,Apple's Safari beats Microsoft's Edge to become the second most used desktop browser,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"In the last couple of months, Microsoft ’s Edge browser has been in the news for all the AI capabilities it now supports. However, that may not have done the trick as according to a report, Apple ’s Safari seems to have a slight edge. As per Statcounter, Apple’s Safari is the second-most popular web browser on desktop. How the top browsers rank It’s no surprise to see Google Chrome dominating the charts. As per Statcounter data, Chrome is the most used browser on desktops across the world with a 66.1% market share. Apple’s Safari — which comes pre-installed on Mac devices — came in second with 11.87% market share. Microsoft Edge was slightly behind with an 11% market share. The other popular browsers across the world are Mozilla Firefox, Opera and Internet Explorer with 5.65%, 3.09% and 0.55% market shares respectively. According to the data, Safari grew more than 2% compared to 2022 whereas Edge grew by 1%. Microsoft has been really aggressive with its AI push in Edge but that’s more on the mobile front. ChatGPT was made available in Edge on both iOS and Android in February this year. Microsoft said that the majority of the traffic comes from mobile phones and hence it pushed ChatGPT first on small screen devices. “Because we know 64% of searches occur on mobile phones, we are releasing all new Bing and Edge mobile apps to serve as your copilot for the web even when you are away from your desktop,” Microsoft had said in a blog post. Having said that AI capabilities in Edge — on mobile and desktop — have been more prominent than ever before. Not just ChatGPT but Edge now supports Dall-E, which is a popular AI image generator. Apple’s AI plans are quite hush-hush as of now. However, we may get to hear more on that when WWDC commence on June 5 when Apple will unveil the latest version of macOS.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//gadgets-news/ai/new-bing/apples-safari-beats-microsofts-edge-to-become-the-second-must-used-desktop-browser/articleshow/99920519.cms
2023-05-01,Future is now: AI to help improve short-term weather forecasts,Priyangi Agarwal,"NEW DELHI: India Meteorological Department has started using Artificial Intelligence experimentally to improve the nowcast and short-range weather forecasts, which range from three hours to seven days. IMD officials said it would take another one to two years for generation of some products. IMD has formed a group of scientists to work on AI and it has collaborated with a few institutions like IITs and universities as well as with some private players. Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general of meteorology, IMD, told TOI, ""There is a scope to improve utilisation for AI in the forecast generated for a few hours to seven days. At present, we provide nowcast for three hours and it can be extended to 6-12 hours. AI can help in improving the accuracy and quality of resolution to give village or panchayat-wise forecasts. Through higher resolution, one can see smaller areas."" IMD currently gives forecasts based on numerical weather prediction modelling. ""Over the periods, the observational data and model data have increased manifold. In India, the observational data has been available since 1901 in digital form for different parameters like temperature, wind, rain, etc. Similarly, satellite data is available from 1983 onwards and data of radars, whose number has increased in the past years, is available from 2002 onwards. This data, which depicts the current status of atmosphere and also provides future characteristics of atmosphere generated by models, can be utilised for AI to derive information,"" said Mohapatra. According to the Met department, AI can be useful in some areas for weather forecasting. As there are various types of observational data which can be utilised along with models to provide forecasts for a few hours where not much science is required, AI can study previous climate patterns to forecast events for nowcasting. In the models, there are many types of data simulated in numerical data after satellite data. Satellite data accumulated is just 5% and most data is not utilised because of limitations in computing power, accuracy and other reasons. ""There is a scope to pre-process which data can go to model with AI. Besides, as there is so much data, AI can help in decision-making,"" said Mohapatra. Numerical modelling, however, will not be stopped as it is the backbone of the forecast. ""AI cannot replace the numerical modelling, but it will complement the modelling system. The objective is to convert the data into value just like converting petroleum into petrol,"" said Mohapatra.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/future-is-now-ai-to-help-improve-short-term-weather-forecasts/articleshow/99896247.cms

Beginning with vocational exposure at early ages in middle and secondary school, quality vocational education will be integrated smoothly into higher education,"" said a circular sent by the board to the head of schools. The skill modules will be of 12-15 hours in duration. The schools have been told that 70% of the time duration for these subjects must be devoted to hands-on activities and 30% to theory. ""Schools can use the 'bagless days' or the vacation time, summer camps, or activity periods to teach the skill modules. Schools can also explore having a regular period for selective skill modules to encourage more students to opt from this academic session itself,"" added the circular.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cbse-students-can-now-learn-ai-coding-from-as-early-as-class-vi/articleshow/99897664.cms
2023-04-30,Greater Noida: Meet at Bennett University explores AI impact on rights,TNN,"NOIDA: Artificial intelligence and its intersection with human rights made for an illuminating discussion at a conference organised on the subject by Bennett University ’s law school in collaboration with the University of Bradford, England, on Friday. Technologies such as AI, depending on how they are used, can improve people’s lives or curtail their human rights, legal experts said. “AI’s gains in law are promising, especially for online research, determining relevant case laws and legal summaries, and analysing and witnessing testimonies in courts,” said professor Engobo Emeseh, dean of School of Law, University of Bradford. However, examining the accuracy of AI is crucial before its application, she said. Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi, chairman of the 22nd Law Commission of India, who addressed the valedictory session, said, “AI can help lawyers in predicting relevant procedures to address and determine the way a trial may turn out for the client. It would help as a time-saving method.” Bennett University, its vice-chancellor Professor Prabhu Kumar Aggarwal said, is testing the boundaries where technology and AI meet. AI, if in the wrong hands, can lead to its drastic misuse, he cautioned. The joint conference, he said, will open up opportunities for quality research for the faculty and scholars. Thirty papers, from national and international law institutes, were presented on ‘Contemporary Issues Concerning AI and Law’, ‘AI, Human Rights and Justice’ and ‘AI and Justice Delivery’ at the conference.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/meet-at-bennett-univ-explores-ai-impact-on-rights/articleshow/99879940.cms

They will also help find missing children PANAJI/CALANGUTE: Cordoning off risk-prone areas along beaches, deployment of artificial intelligence ( AI ) systems to monitor risk-prone zones, increasing awareness about safe swimming practices are some of the measures that are being rolled out to enhance beach safety. A ‘paw squad’, trained dogs will also assist in lifesaving measures. “A tragedy involving tourists reflects on tourism and safety in the state. We spoke to Drishti Marine about risk-prone areas on the beach, and it proposed some products for beach safety,” said tourism minister Rohan Khaunte at the launch of new measures on Candolim beach on Friday. Last week, four youths drowned on Keri beach while taking selfies from a clearly marked ‘no go area.’ The state-appointed lifeguarding agency will start with closure of risk-prone stretches and ‘Swim with Lifesavers’ initiative in phase I. It is also readying a ‘paw squad’, to aid lifesavers in rescue and beach safety operations. Navin Awashti, operations manager of Drishti Marine, said the dog squad will be first deployed at high-density beaches. “A team of 11 dogs is being trained to spot and rescue victims in distress,” said Awashti. The dog squad will also help find children who go missing on beaches. ‘Swim with Lifesavers’ was launched in 2021 to create awareness about safe swimming and offer tips. The idea, he said, was to also encourage enthusiasts to respect the sea. A 60-minute programme offers a guided swim session which is open to all. “The programme is implemented on beaches of Miramar, Benaulim, Colva and Candolim which are known to have high footfalls,” Awashti said. Meanwhile, it is also in the process of fine-tuning its artificial intelligence (AI) apparatus for beach safety. Aurus is a self-driving robot while the AI-powered monitoring system, Triton, will augment life-saving capabilities on beaches. “Both systems can monitor surroundings, assess risks and share real-time information to help lifesavers respond expeditiously,” Awashti said. Aurus is deployed as a pilot project on Miramar Beach while Triton is under testing at Baina, Velsao, Benaulim, Galgibaga beaches in South Goa and Morjim in North Goa. Drishti Marine intends to roll out 100 Triton units and 10 Aurus units shortly.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/from-ai-monitoring-to-a-paw-squad-dhristi-to-step-up-beach-surveillance/articleshow/99854520.cms

BENGALURU: After engineering colleges , degree colleges too have joined the mad rush for new-age courses in data science , artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT). Autonomous colleges in Bengaluru are set to start BSc programmes in these domains following high demand. With the new education policy making it mandatory for students to choose electives from other streams, many courses are getting a new lease of life, said city colleges. Admissions have begun in all colleges in Bengaluru, with BCom and BCA being the most preferred options. Admissions to science stream usually pick up only after the results of the Common Entrance Test (CET) and other competitive examinations are announced. Kristu Jayanti College that had started BSc in data science last year, is now offering BSc in cloud computing and IoT. ""These courses are highly popular among students.

2023-04-26,Google earnings top expectations as AI battle heats up,AFP,"SAN FRANCISCO: Google parent company Alphabet beat market expectations in the first quarter of 2023 with a net profit of $15 billion, the company said on Tuesday, in a sign that the search engine behemoth is regaining its footing. The tech titan has found itself under pressure due to a general slowdown in advertising spending, over-hiring during a Covid-era boom and a major challenge by Microsoft on artificial intelligence. Its quarterly revenue came in at nearly $70 billion, a billion better than expected by analysts, and in the same three-month period that the company said it would lay off 12,000 staff, or six percent of its workforce. In its results, Google announced a $2 billion charge for expected costs for the sackings. Google became a focus of worry when Microsoft-backed ChatGPT was released and quickly went viral late last year. The Windows maker has added the technology to its Bing search engine and office software. The search giant has since rushed out Bard , its own version of the language-based AI , but the release was seen as clumsy and has so far disappointed observers and company insiders, according to media reports. An arms race over AI is expected to play out for several years and could prove to be expensive for the tech giants, with companies worried that they could lose out quickly to rivals. To get itself battle ready for the AI wars ahead, Google has reorganized its AI division, putting the independently run Deep Mind subsidiary inside the company in a division called Google Brain. The host of challenges sent Google CEO Sundar Pichai on a rare US media tour in recent weeks to reassure that the company remained an industry leader on everything from search to maps to AI pioneering. Despite the headwinds, Pichai received a total compensation package worth more than $225 million in 2022, according to a regulatory filing posted last week. Indicating that troubles are still not gone, Google-owned YouTube's advertising revenue dropped for the third quarter in a row, declining 2.6 percent year over year to $6.7 billion. The struggles at YouTube came in the same quarter that its longtime CEO Susan Wojcicki stepped down after nine years, replaced by longtime executive Neal Mohan. ""Google exceeded both revenue and earnings expectations this quarter, but reasons for investor optimism are modest,"" said Insider Intelligence senior analyst Max Willens. ""More importantly, Google's ad business is under threat. YouTube revenues declining again, and Search and Other revenues rising less than 2 percent reflect the reality that Google's core business is facing the most serious challenges it has encountered in quite some time."" Despite the deeper-rooted problems, Alphabet's share price has recovered well from the lows seen before January's layoff announcements and on Tuesday shot up by more than 4 percent in after-hours trading to $108.4. This was still well shy of the near $150 seen in 2021, when ad revenue was pouring in.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/google-earnings-top-expectations-as-ai-battle-heats-up/articleshow/99773736.cms
2023-04-26,"Microsoft results top forecasts, shares jump 8% as AI juices sales",Reuters,"SAN FRANCISCO: Microsoft Corp beat Wall Street's estimates for quarterly revenue and profit on Tuesday, driven by growth in its cloud computing and Office productivity software businesses, and the company said artificial intelligence products were stimulating sales. The company forecast revenue in its main segments for the current quarter would match or top Wall Street targets. Shares gained 8.3% in after-market trading following a report by Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft that profits were $2.45 per share in the fiscal third quarter, beating Wall Street estimates of $2.23, according to data from Refinitiv. ""The bottom line is that despite all the concerns that the sky is falling in big tech, the truth is companies still see value in cloud computing and there's still a huge percentage of workloads that can be moved to the cloud,"" said Bob O’Donnell, an analyst for TECHnalysis Research. Microsoft said growth at its cloud business Azure was 27% in the latest reported quarter, beating analyst expectations for 26.6% growth, according to the consensus from 23 analysts polled by Visible Alpha. Alphabet Inc which also has a large cloud business, reported strong results Tuesday, lifting its shares 2.4% after the bell. Those results and Microsoft's helped boost shares of Amazon.com Inc , another major cloud operator, 4.8% in after hours trading. Microsoft revenue rose 7% to $52.9 billion in the quarter ended March, inching past analyst estimates of $51.02 billion, according to Refinitiv. The bulk of Microsoft sales still come from selling software and cloud computing services to customers. But the company has grabbed headlines this year with its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI and sprucing up the Bing search engine with artificial intelligence technology. Chief Executive Satya Nadella told investors on a conference call the company had more than 2,500 Azure-OpenAI service customers and said AI was integrated into a wide array of products. Bing, long an also-ran to search engine Google, has 100 million daily users and has seen downloads jump since the addition of AI features, Nadella said. Analysts had expected a gloomy economic outlook to hit Microsoft's Windows business, which depends heavily on PC sales that have sagged in recent quarters. The sales drop in the segment was less severe than analysts expected, with Microsoft reporting revenue of $13.3 billion versus analyst estimates of $12.19 billion, according to Refinitiv data. The company's productivity segment, which includes its Office software and advertising sales for the LinkedIn social networking site, also beat analyst expectations with revenue of $17.5 billion versus estimates of $16.99 billion, according to Refinitiv.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/microsoft-results-top-forecasts-shares-jump-8-as-ai-juices-sales/articleshow/99773719.cms

The “One Nation, One Application” platform is intended to allow MPs quick access to Parliament resources through the portal’s ‘Knowledge Management System’ while the secretariat will be able to disseminate information online . The portal will facilitate end-to-end digital communication between ministries and Parliament, and for citizens, it will facilitate easy access to parliamentary business and other associated information. It has weaved in advanced AI-based ‘speech-to-text’ conversion engines that can translate parliamentary proceedings in real time. This will mean that transcripts currently created by the reporting branch of Parliament secretariat will now benefit from the support of a “continually evolving” system that can create an accurate transcript of the proceedings of the House, using an audio feed of the proceedings, catering to the diversity. The portal, which will eventually link all 31 state assemblies, is also using emerging technologies like automatic indexing and tagging of files to improve search responses. The portal will also introduce AI-based conversational chat and voice-based bots that will respond to instructions. In addition, the existing Digital Sansad mobile application will further be strengthened to enable access not only to both houses but also to all state assemblies in a phased manner.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/digital-sansad-to-use-ai-to-transcribe-house-proceedings-real-time/articleshow/99770031.cms

In a statement, the ULCCS managing director said that the society has no connection with the implementation of the project in the state. Several of the names being mentioned by some in the social media and mainstream media are not of the directors of the ULCCS. A hospital management software project was entrusted to the ULCCS by the company named SRIT India Pvt Ltd, in 2016. A joint initiative named ULCCS-SRIT was launched for the project by these two organisations. The directors of both the companies were part of ULCCS-SRIT. The project was completed in 2018 and ULCCS-SRIT was dissolved. Thus, there is no such organization named ULCCS-SRIT now. But some websites like www.zubacorp.com still display the company details of ULCCS-SRIT when the details of SRIT are searched for. The details of the dissolved company are still being shown by such websites because they have not updated their data. Even mainstream media have reported about the dissolution of ULCCS-SRIT earlier. The ULCCS management requested that mention of the society should be withdrawn since the ULCCS has no links with SRIT or the installation of AI traffic cameras. The 726 AI traffic cameras that have been installed by the motor vehicles department has run into controversy after the money spent on the project (which is presently spent by the Keltron, to be reimbursed to it from the public exchequer) is exorbitant and is mainly aimed at raising revenue for the cash-strapped government by even compromising privacy aspects of the citizens.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ulccs-denies-having-any-links-with-ai-camera-project/articleshow/99746458.cms

According to helmet shopowners in the city, there is an increase in demand for helmets for kids and women. “More customers are now coming forward to buy helmets for fellow passengers, especially children and women. Prices start from Rs 700 onwards. While there are cartoon-designed helmets for kids, adults have the option of choosing from brands which offer anti-fungal and anti-allergic inner material in addition to necessary ventilation to keep off excess heat,” says Rakhin , owner of The Helmet World. Shops with outlets outside the city limit seeing a boom in sales may be an indication that the public has taken the recent move by the traffic department seriously. “We have four branches in Thiruvananthapuram of which the one at Parassala records more purchases compared to the others. Almost 90% of two-wheeler drivers use helmets in the city while those residing in rural areas had not placed much importance on such rules until now,” said Ashwin Thomas who owns Motor Gears. Roadside helmet shops set up by migrant workers share the recent profits as these prove to be immediate pit stops for helmets and other driving gear. “It has been around 11 years since I started this stall near Kesavadasapuram. There are various kinds of helmets available from Rs 400. Women and manual labourers are the major customers as they usually buy helmets to ride pillion with someone,” says Mohan , a native of Hyderabad. The public, on the other hand, have the opinion that the rules have been suddenly imposed upon them with no room for flexibility. “The safety aspect is absolutely good but to levy such hefty fines to start off seems a bit too far,” said Justin, a city resident.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/helmet-sales-go-up-after-govt-enables-ai-cameras/articleshow/99746450.cms

The report assessed ChatGPT by feeding it more than 25,000 assessment questions from 187 institutions around the world and cross-referencing the results with the performance of accounting students. The study has been published in the journal Issues in Accounting Education. Across all assessments, including topics such as audit, financial accounting, management accounting and tax, students scored an average of 76.7%, while ChatGPT scored just 47.4%. The questions ChatGPT failed in, and the ones it did well The areas that the AI bot did not perform well on are tax, financial, and managerial assessments. As per the study, ChatGPT struggled with the mathematical processes required for the taxation and other financial data types. When it came to the type of questions, while ChatGPT did reasonably better on true/false questions and multiple-choice questions, the AI chatbot struggled with short-answer questions. ""ChatGPT doesn't always recognise when it is doing math and makes nonsensical errors such as adding two numbers in a subtraction problem, or dividing numbers incorrectly,"" the study found. The study further said that ChatGPT often provides explanations for its answers, even if they are incorrect. It further claims that several times, the descriptions given by ChatGPT are accurate, however, the answers it gives are wrong. This includes selecting the wrong multiple-choice answer.

At the same time, the colleges want to cut 2,946 seats from civil and mechanical engineering branches. And, another 750 seats from electrical and electronics, and electronics and communication. Data provided by Anna University showed 134 colleges applied to change their intake for the 2023-24 academic year. ""There are opportunities for students studying artificial intelligence, data science, machine learning and cyber security. In future, there will be demand for students with narrowed specialisations,"" said Anna University vice-chancellor R Velraj . The All-India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) encourages engineering colleges to start courses in emerging areas. Professors said the emergence of ChatGPT also created a huge interest in AI among colleges and students. ""Earlier, studying a super specialisation in undergraduation was considered wrong. This view has changed in the past two years due to technological intervention in all fields. Those studying AI will have job opportunities in all companies with IT applications,"" said T Kalaiselvan , former additional director, Centre for University-Industry Collaboration, Anna University. However, career consultant Jayaprakash Gandhi said students choose AI and other courses in emerging areas without knowing future job prospects. ""In 2027, 60% of students coming out of engineering colleges will have computer related degrees. Getting a job will be a tough task,"" he said. A challenge for colleges is the shortage of computer science faculty, and the task of training faculty in AI, machine learning, and cyber security. ""The top colleges will hire qualified faculty members by offering attractive salaries. However, there is a huge shortage in other colleges as few students opted for postgraduate programmes in the past decade,"" said R M Kishore, deputy secretary, Consortium of Self-Financing Professional, Arts and Science Colleges in Tamil Nadu. He said faculty members from EEE, ECE should be allowed to teach computer-related courses. The consortium also plans to conduct a training programme for private college faculty in AI and machine learning and other emerging areas.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-engineering-colleges-to-add-8500-seats-in-artificial-intelligence-data-science/articleshow/99699072.cms
2023-04-22,Not a fad: Tech comapnies delve into generative AI space,Veena Mani,"BENGALURU: This earnings season, almost all the IT services companies who have announced their results to date have spoken about generative AI. TCS COO N G Subramaniam said at the company’s earnings press conference that clients are increasingly asking how generative AI can be incorporated in their offerings. Infosys also said they are betting on generative AI. Some like Accenture have already started using it for clients. The IT services provider said in its earnings call that a generative AI solution created for a banking client understands the context of e-mails and automatically sends out the mails to the right teams and helps them draft the right responses. The IT services firms are also looking at generative AI to become more efficient in what they already offer. In a recent blog by Harleen Bedi, head of new offerings and innovation and technology architect group at Infosys, said that with no-code andlow-code, the job of testing got passed on to non-specialists, and generative AI will take it one step ahead and extract data on the patterns in testing and finally provide actionable points for techies to work on. She believes that notes from the machine will help software professionals learn more and hone their skills. Accenture’s CEO Julie Sweet called generative AI a “co-pilot” to human beings, during the firm’s earnings call. “The entire process (of human beings and machinesworking together) has to be changed in order to make that work. You’ve got to upskill people and you have to be able to do all of that in a very responsible way,” Sweet said. Kashyap Dalal , co-founder of Simplilearn, says big IT firms are still trying to figure out where the opportunities lie — financial sector or content or somewhere else. “Once this is clear, they want to think of introducing courses on ChatGPT or generative AI to employees,” he said. Mrinal Rai, principal analyst at research firm ISG, says there is push from clients to use these new AI models. “There is a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out) in most of them. Having said that, it is not a fad. Generative AI is here to stay,” Rai says. Ray Wang , principal analyst and founder at Constellation Research, says these firms will have to work on creating synthetic data, training machines and building prompts to achieve high levels of precision. And that, he says, is just the beginning of use of generative AI.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/not-a-fad-tech-comapnies-delve-into-generative-ai-space/articleshow/99680263.cms
2023-04-20,"AI to help track, maintain upkeep of 16 key stretches in Delhi",Siddhanta mishra,"NEW DELHI: From checking thefts to monitoring late staff to alerting about broken footpaths, a model based on artificial intelligence (AI) is set to help the Public Works Department (PWD) keep watch over 41km of 16 road stretches, currently being revamped in the first phase of the streetscaping project. ""A dashboard will be created to give hourly reports if there are any changes to the existing road infrastructure. It will also provide us tasks required to be done,"" said an official. ""The need for AI was felt because there have been many instances in the past where a road was broken or there is water leakage, but as reports reached senior officers late, action was taken only after two-three days. AI will eliminate this delay and we will be able to take prompt action,"" he added. If successful, the pilot project could be expanded to the second phase, he said. According to officials of the streetscaping division, the AI model, combined with CCTV footage and physical logbooks of security guards and other workers, will give real-time reports of damages to roads and footpaths, discolouring of pavements and theft of items like decorative lights or steel sculptures. AI will also monitor the working of staff hired by PWD to look after the roads. Uniforms of security guards, gardeners and labourers would be geo-tagged to allow PWD to keep an eye on their movements and detect lapses, if any. Under the streetscaping project, PWD invested in exotic horticulture work along the central verges and roadsides. Expensive decorative lights and benches have also been installed, along with mild-steel sculptures. The department had observed thefts and encroachment on the roads, following which it deployed security guards on each stretch. During this year's budget speech, finance minister Kailash Gahlot had claimed that building on the government's success under the streetscaping pilot project, Delhi's roads will present nothing less than international standards by the end of the next financial year. PWD is looking to hire an agency for 10 years to maintain the roads and keep them clean and beautiful. It is likely the AI model will be used to monitor the agency's work and give reports to department officials.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ai-to-help-track-maintain-upkeep-of-16-key-stretches-in-delhi/articleshow/99623980.cms
2023-04-19,"Clone wars: Schools, universities in Delhi brace for AI onslaught",Shradha Chettri&Shinjini Ghosh,"NEW DELHI: Identical essays, similar arguments and erosion in the quality of assignments submitted - teachers are beset with the onslaught of Artificial Intelligence-based technologies that generate text, such as ChatGPT . With such chatbots increasingly popular among students, tackling it was becoming challenging to teachers and professors at the school and university levels, their fear being that indiscriminate use of the tech could impair students' analytical skills. Sucharita Sen, professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, recounted, ""Recently, the responses to an assignment on economic geography I gave were correct but they were identical and there was no uniqueness. When I asked them, the students accepted having used ChatGPT. Clearly, when preparing for the assignment, they did not do much thinking."" If AI is here to stay, it is, declared Debraj Mookerjee, associate professor of English, Ramjas College. ""Much like the calculator which took basic calculations out of the learning process, AI can become a useful tool in education. The thing is to not blindly resist it, but to incorporate it with calibration and synergy."" In this spirit, teachers are having to ask questions like: Is there a way to redesign assignments in light of the changing technology? Sudha Acharya, principal, ITL Public School, Dwarka, said, ""Whenever a new technology or tech upgrade emerges, we think of how it will affect our academic integrity and the honesty of students. It forces us to rethink, reimagine and redesign the teaching-learning process."" A large number of students are already using the new tech, said Divya Bhatia, principal, Amity International School, Saket. ""Justifiably then, there are growing concerns about plagiarism, ethics and misinformation,"" she said. ""There is now a requirement for intensive teacher training. Assignments, for example, must be more innovative to incorporate the use of AI tools as an academic resource."" Accepting the use of AI tools in education, said professor Mausam, head, Yardi School of Artificial Intelligence , IIT-Delhi, ""may mean changing the nature of assignments to make it ChatGPT-proof or encouraging every student to use the chatbot to shorten the task involved in accomplishing a bigger task"". At IIT-D, when some computer professors recently experimented and allowed the students to use the platform, the latter found that improving ChatGPT prompts and debugging its mistakes were more cumbersome than writing the code from scratch. ""The experience of non-computer science departments may be different,"" said Mausam. ""Because of ChatGPT's exceptional writing skills, the answers come across as rather polished, and may be perceived, even erroneously, as making strong arguments. But the humanities departments may face more challenges. In sociology and philosophy, there isn't always one right answer. The emphasis, therefore, should be on teaching students how to analyse a situation and make cogent arguments."" At Delhi Technological University too, professor Dinesh Vishwakarma, head, information technology department, had a similar opinion. ""ChatGPT and its ilk are more helpful for people who have only a little understanding and we are not encouraging those who have some expertise to use such platforms because it restricts innovative thoughts,"" he said. Instead of blocking access to ChatGPT, as in some schools in New York and Seattle, academicians here feel the mode of evaluation has to change. ""Even the National Education Policy wants the system to adapt to disruptive technologies like AI,"" pointed out professor S K Naqvi, head, FTK Centre for Information Technology, Jamia Millia Islamia. ""Yes, anti-plagiarism tools can detect assignments generated on such platforms, but we can also think of different ways to evaluate students' works. If a professor is unsure of whether the student has copied, maybe an oral component could be incorporated to assess comprehension of the topic taught."" Many teachers refuse to demonise AI technologies, recognising how it can be employed constructively. Gurpreet Singh Tuteja, mathematics professor, Zakir Hussain Delhi College, has been advising teachers and students to learn from these platforms and use the tech ethically. Amity International's Bhatia said, ""For teachers, ChatGPT can be an assistive tool to generate lesson plans, generate worksheets and create study material."" Mausam was more specific on this. ""Imagine a student who is weak in English but otherwise has good reasoning skills. For such an individual, a platform like ChatGPT with its impeccable language skills can write and reorganise their draft answers, thus enormously improving the impact of their work. I feel such usage should be encouraged in a country like ours where most are non-native speakers of English,"" the IIT-D teacher said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/clone-wars-schools-universities-in-delhi-brace-for-ai-onslaught/articleshow/99598400.cms

2023-04-19,Home minister Amit Shah stresses on enhanced use of AI to analyse crimes,TNN,"NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah , while presiding over a 'chintan shivir' (introspection camp) of senior MHA officers here on Tuesday, emphasised on the need to develop an ecosystem for cybercrime management and make enhanced use of artificial intelligence to critically analyse crimes from the crime and criminal tracking network and systems (CCTNS) database and come up with solutions to make the cities safer. At the day-long chintan shivir -held to review work of the home ministry and also evolve an action plan to implement PM Narendra Modi's 'Vision 2047' -Shah called for fast-tracking the construction of fencing and roads in the border areas. He said the MHA officials should make field visits to monitor development schemes, particularly in areas affected by terror, left-wing extremism or insurgency and also in the border regions. Spread over two sessions, the chintan shivir commenced with an in-depth review of the status of compliance of instructions given by the home minister during an earlier discussion with the officers of the ministry. The functioning of MHA dashboard, government land information system, utilisation of MHA budget, e-office and special recruitment drive were reviewed in detail. Shah also took stock of the work of various MHA divisions, going over their priorities and deliverables in the coming years; status of ' Atmanirbhar Bharat ' initiatives; progress on various budget announcements related to the ministry; and all key pending issues. In his remarks, Shah emphasised on developing an ecosystem for cybercrime management, modernisation of police forces, increased use of IT in criminal justice system, land border management and coastal security issues etc. He suggested that artificial intelligence be employed to explore solutions to crimes in the cities - particularly directed at women, children and other vulnerable sections - and make them safer. Focusing on the recruitment process - particularly in the IPS , central armed police forces (CAPFs) and central police organisations - Shah stressed on the need to fast-track it and anticipate the future vacancies well in advance so that recruitment is initiated before the posts get vacant. He said that meetings of departmental promotion committees should be held regularly so that employees get timely promotions. Stressing on the importance of training, Shah said regular training programmes should be conducted by all wings of the MHA.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/home-minister-amit-shah-stresses-on-enhanced-use-of-ai-to-analyse-crimes/articleshow/99596682.cms
2023-04-18,"Deepfake porn: Amid AI race, another growing menace",AP,"NEW YORK : Artificial intelligence imaging can be used to create art, try on clothes in virtual fitting rooms or help design ad campaigns. But experts fear the darker side of the easily accessible tools could worsen something that primarily harms women: nonconsensual deepfake pornography. Deepfakes are videos and images that have been digitally created or altered with AI or machine learning. Porn created using the technology first began spreading across the internet several years ago when a Reddit user shared clips that placed the faces of female celebrities on the shoulders of porn actors. Since then, deepfake creators have disseminated similar videos and images targeting online influencers, journalists and others with a public profile. Thousands of videos exist across a plethora of websites. And some have been offering users the opportunity to create their own images - essentially allowing anyone to turn whoever they wish into sexual fantasies without their consent, or use the technology to harm former partners. The problem, experts say, grew as it became easier to make sophisticated deepfakes. And they say it could get worse with the development of generative AI tools that are trained on billions of images from the internet and spit out novel content using existing data. ""The reality is that the technology will continue to develop and will continue to become as easy as pushing the button,"" said Adam Dodge , the founder of EndTAB, a group that provides trainings on technology-enabled abuse. ""And as long as that happens, people will continue to misuse the technology to harm others, primarily through online sexual violence, deepfake porn and fake nude images."" Noelle Martin , of Perth , Australia, has experienced that reality. The 28-year-old found deepfake porn of herself 10 years ago when out of curiosity one day she used Google to search an image of herself. To this day, Martin says she doesn't know who created the fake images, or videos of her engaging in sexual intercourse. Horrified, Martin contacted different websites for a number of years in an effort to get the images taken down. Some didn't respond. Others took it down but she soon found it up again. ""You can't win,"" she said. Eventually, Martin turned her attention towards legislation, advocating for a national law in Australia that would fine companies 555,000 Australian dollars ($370,706) if they don't comply with removal notices for such content from online safety regulators. But governing the internet is next to impossible when countries have their own laws for content that's sometimes made halfway around the world. In the meantime, some AI models say they're curbing access to explicit images. ap",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/deepfake-porn-amid-ai-race-another-growing-menace/articleshow/99570570.cms
2023-04-17,IISER research team develops AI-based tool to predict bacterial enzymes,Ramendra Singh,"BHOPAL: The Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhopal researchers have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) based method to predict how the bacteria in gut breaks down various types of food and medication. This web-based tool provides information about specific bacterial enzymes, reactions, and bacteria involved in the process of digestion and absorption of nutrients by the human gut. IISER Bhopal team has created an AI-based tool called ""GutBug” that can potentially predict all possible bacterial enzymes that act on bioactive dietary molecules as well as oral drugs. The finding of this research was published recentlyin the Journal of Molecular Biology. The paper has been co-authored by Dr Vineet Sharma , associate professor of department of biological sciences, IISER Bhopal, along with research scholars Aditya Malwe and Gopal Srivastava . GutBug is available at https://metabiosys.iiserb.ac.in/gutbug. The collection of good bacteria in the gut is called gut microbiome which plays a crucial role in the body processes of anything a human consumes orally. The number of microbes living in the gastrointestinal tract is greater than the number of human cells in the body. The human gut microbiome is made of over a thousand different species of bacteria, which have more than 3.3 million unique genes. These bacteria secrete enzymes to process what a human eats and provide the body with various metabolites that are essential for health and body functions. However, studying the complex host-microbial relationships is a challenge because of the vastness of the microbiome and the fact that the collection of bacteria varies among individuals. Explaining the technicalities of the research, Dr Vineet K. Sharma said, “GutBug uses a combination of machine learning, neural networks, and chemoinformatic methods. We used a curated database of 363,872 enzymes from ~700 human gut bacterial strains and a substrate database consisting of 3,457 enzymes to train the AI model.” Dr Sharma said, “GutBug can help better understand how the food we eat or medicines we consume orally are processed by our gut bacteria and how this affects our health. Such understanding can be useful in designing diets, developing new prebiotics, creating nutraceutical products, and improving drug design depending on the nature of the gut bacteria each individual has, leading to personalized medicine.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/iiser-research-team-develops-ai-based-tool-to-predict-bacterial-enzymes/articleshow/99545380.cms
2023-04-16,"We should not repeat with AI the mistakes we made with social media, Toby Walsh",Sneha Bhura,"As artificial intelligence tools reshape society, many are discussing the risks it poses. Tech doyens like Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak have called for a pause to AI research while Italy has banned ChatGPT . AI expert Toby Walsh, whose latest book is titled ‘Machines Behaving Badly: The Morality of AI’, talks to Sunday Times about the need for regulation Generative AI models like ChatGPT have overtaken every conversation around technology. What is your view about them? This is a revolution that I would compare to the invention of the PC and the smartphone. It heralds a new way for us to interact with our digital devices. The PC revolution put computers on our desks. The smartphone revolution put computers into our hands. This AI revolution will sprinkle some intelligence — some AI — into all our digital devices. We’ll talk to them, they’ll answer back, and they’ll be able to do complex and cognitively demanding tasks for us. It’s much bigger than just generative AI. Generative AI is merely the first example of where we can see AI bringing value to our digital lives. Soon, every digital device will have AI added to it. Instead of us having to learn how to use computers, computers will learn how to serve us. I’m not surprised Meta (aka Facebook) pivoted to AI. It’s going to be much, much bigger than the metaverse. There is now an open letter by hundreds of experts and scientists calling all AI labs to immediately pause the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. Is this six-month moratorium likely to stem the tide of tech companies rushing to build AI systems with human-competitive intelligence? I was asked to sign the letter but declined. There is no hope in hell that a six-month moratorium will be respected. And indeed, it is counter-productive. We need more research, not less. But we do need the tech companies to deploy AI in a more responsible way. The idea that you give AI products to the public knowing that harms will be committed and iterate quickly to remove them is irresponsible and should be outlawed. China, funnily enough, is doing more with respect to this than the West. If we’re not careful, we will repeat with AI many of the mistakes we made with social media, putting it into the hands of the many before we have adequately dealt with the harm caused to our privacy, our democracy and our society. In one of your books, you predicted the transformation of Homo sapiens into Homo digitalis by 2062. Would you like to revise this threshold point in view of the way AI-enabled chatbots are growing more sophisticated? Yes, 2062 looks a little pessimistic now. It was the average estimate of when computers would match human intelligence in all its richness. I (and, I suspect, many of my colleagues) might predict 2052 now. We still have some significant mountains to climb to give computers a real understanding of language, common sense reasoning and all the rest of the creativity and adaptability that goes into human intelligence. Italy has become the first country to ban ChatGpt. Other governments are also trying to come up with their own regulatory rules. If banning is not an option, what could the architecture of a safe and beneficial AI look like in the near future? We need more regulation for the responsible deployment of AI. I am surprised that governments are letting OpenAI, Microsoft and Alphabet put products into the hands of consumers knowing that harm will occur. We’ve already had examples of some of the harm. For instance, people who are wrongly accused of crimes by these chatbots. These are, sadly, the perfect tools with which to spread misinformation and hate speech. ChatGpt, Bard, Ernie, ChatSonic etc., the battle of the chatbots has begun. Where are we headed with this? AI is a platform technology. It is another layer, an artificially intelligent layer that sits on top of everything digital. There will be specialised AI interfaces in every part of our lives. Your bank will have one that speaks finance. Your insurance company will have one that speaks insurance. The government will have one that speaks about government services. And your smartphone will have one that will know everything about you, your likes and dislikes, it will write like you, will sound like you and will, in digital form, be a digital double of you. AI will be a multi-trillion dollar industry. Companies like Google could be easily displaced. Who wants to search for links when you can search for an answer? What about the challenges for developing countries like India? AI can do the 4Ds: the dirty, the dull, the difficult, and the dangerous. But alongside these benefits, there could be significant challenges for a country like India. For example, it could be that many people working in call centres in India are replaced by chatbots. Call centre workers are often reading from a script. A computer can now do this much better, and cheaper.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/we-should-not-repeat-with-ai-the-mistakes-we-made-with-social-media-toby-walsh/articleshow/99521388.cms

While officially it’s not mentioned anywhere, one of the goals of offering skill modules is to help kids make an informed decision about their academic and career choices later in life. The move by the CBSE is part of its aggressive push on all fronts to align itself with National Education Policy (NEP) guidelines. The NEP strongly encourages skill development at the school level itself. A circular from CBSE says the policy aims to overcome the social status hierarchy associated with vocational education and requires integration of vocational education courses into mainstream education in all institutions in a phased manner. “Beginning with vocational exposure in the middle and secondary schools, quality vocational education will be integrated smoothly into higher education. It will ensure that every child learns at least one vocation and is exposed to several more,” the circular added. The board says this would lead to emphasizing the dignity of labour and importance of various vocations involving Indian arts and artisanship. All these skill modules are aligned to the skill-related subjects being offered in CBSE’s secondary and senior secondary level. Though it’s not mandatory, CBSE is encouraging schools to offer these skill modules at their institutes. These can be taught during holidays, vacations or even integrated into regular teaching.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/from-ai-to-kashida-cbse-offers-wider-learning-options/articleshow/99506767.cms
2023-04-15,Elon Musk may be working on creating a ChatGPT rival,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"It is a rather well-known fact that Elon Musk was one of the co-founders of OpenAI , the company behind ChatGPT . However, a few years after co-founding it, Musk walked away as he wanted the company to be a “non-profit”. Now, if reports are to be believed then Musk’s latest plan is an AI startup, which will compete with the likes of OpenAI. A report by The Wall Street Journal states the company is called X.AI. Further, a report by The Verge reveals that the company was founded on March 9, 2023. According to a report by The Financial Times, Musk’s plan is already in motion and the startup has hired researchers and engineers. The startup, as per the report, is hiring from top AI firms from across the world. Furthermore, the report also states that Musk has already purchased “thousands” of Nvidia GPU processors, which are critical in creating large language models on which ChatGPT is based. In fact, in a recent Twitter Spaces, Musk confirmed the purchased without getting into details. “It seems like everyone and their dog is buying GPUs at this point,” Musk said. “Twitter and Tesla are certainly buying GPUs,” he said. Musk hasn’t spoken about this, so other details are still not known about the startup. Musk’s ‘worry’ over use of AI The Tesla CEO has been vocal in the past about use of AI. In the past, he has termed AI as “one of the biggest risks to civilisation”. Musk was speaking at World Government Summit in Dubai earlier this year and stressed on the positive and negative aspect of it. “It’s both positive or negative and has great, great promise, great capability,” Musk said. However, he did warn “with that comes great danger.” Google CEO Sundar Pichai also in an interview said that many years ago he had spoken to Musk about AI and how the Tesla CEO was concerned about AI.

Over the past few weeks, dozens of photos have appeared showing the leader of the world’s Roman Catholics in strange scenarios, sending social media into a tizzy. Apart from the pontiff himself, the images all have something in common: They are fake, made by artificial intelligence tools that create images from short text prompts. Many public figures have popped up in AI-generated pictures recently, but the images with Francis have made the biggest splash. They have earned more views, likes and comments than other AI photos, according to a review by New York Times , prompting arace to depict the 86-year-old in odder and odder situations. “I had to get involved in the pope thing,” one Reddit user recently wrote alongside AI images of Francis practicing martial arts and playing basketball. Francis’ prevalence in AI-generated images is the result of a perfect storm of factors, experts said. After 10 years as the head of the Catholic Church , he is instantly recognisable around the world. He is viewed as an approachable leader. And when combined with a burst of interest in new AI tools, Francis became the recurring choice of creators to place in the most incongruous scenarios. The goal, some creators said, was to show that even the pope can have fun. Global religious figures such as the pope are natural subjects of political satire and artistic expression, said Jennifer Herdt , a professor of Christian ethics. But AI images can be dangerous if people believe them to be real and misuse them to spread misinformation. “You lull people into not double checking,” said Subbarao Kambhampati , a computer science professor. The Vatican did not comment. The image that turned Francis into an AI star shows him in a white puffer jacket in the style of Balenciaga, a haute fashion house. It appeared to have first been posted on March 24 on Reddit for the generative AI tool Midjourney and then shared across social media. One tweet sharing the image — captioned “The boys in Brooklyn could only hope for this level of drip” — was liked more than 2,29,000 times and viewed 20. 6 million times. In contrast, a tweet sharing AI generated images of former US President Donald Trump’s being arrested got 40,000 likes and 6. 4 million views.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/pope-francis-has-become-the-star-of-ai-generated-photographs/articleshow/99366736.cms
2023-04-08,1st for city: AI-based cancer diagnostic tools at RST Hosp,Chaitanya Deshpande,"Nagpur: On World health Day (April 7), the Rashtra Sant Tukdoji (RST) Regional Cancer Hospital and Research Centre revealed two state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence-based diagnostic tools to detect breast and oral cancer. The hospital got these machines through donations by philanthropists. ‘Thermalytix’, used to screen pre-malignant and malignant lesion of breast, is the first in Central India while the ‘oral scan’, an optical imaging device for early detection of cancerous lesions in the oral cavity, is the first in Maharashtra. The hospital is using both these tools for cancer screening camps in rural areas. The services are available free of cost to all patients. Both devices were developed by deep-tech startups. ‘Thermalytix’ is a product of Bangaluru-based Non-Invasive Risk Assessment with Machine Intelligence (NIRAMAI) while the oral scan has been developed by startup Sascan Meditech and incubated at Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences & Technology, Thiruvananthapuram . “We have used these tools on more than 200 individuals and detected five confirmed oral cancer cases and three breast cancer cases so far,” said Dr Kartar Singh , director of RST hospital. Both the devices capture high resolution thermal sensing pictures and send them to a cloud hosted analytics solutions for analyzing. Using big data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, these tools give early and accurate cancer screening results. The increasing prevalence of oral cancer in Vidarbha has always been a cause for concern for doctors. While head and neck cancer is more common in men due to tobacco addiction and kharra, breast cancer is becoming more common in women these days and has already replaced Cervix cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Vidarbha women. The breast cancer screening device has been donated by Manoj Shivnani while Ms Bajaj Steel Industries in Nagpur MIDC has given the oral scan, a toothbrush-sized cancer screening tool. The initial cost of both devices is in the range of ₹8-14 lakh, but AI support for analytics is also a constant paid service.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/1st-for-city-ai-based-cancer-diagnostic-tools-at-rst-hosp/articleshow/99330168.cms

Dr Kalpesh Shah , a neurosurgeon with Zydus Hospital , said the first four and a half hours after a stroke are crucial. “We are training ICU staff and doctors — with more than 150 trained in the vicinity of Ahmedabad so far — in identifying signs and using patients’ CT scans for indicators of stroke. An upload on the app connects experts and doctors who can quickly go through the results from the AI — the initial diagnosis and possible damage — and can suggest a course of action,” he said. He added that while there’s awareness about heart attacks, their groups are creating awareness on brain stroke to save lives and stave off disability. As April 7 is celebrated as World Health Day, medical experts in the city spoke about the impact of emerging technologies such as AI in the context of the medical field. Neeraj Lal , COO of Apollo Hospital, said with programmed algorithms, special programs quickly identify possible health risks including non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, hypertension or dyslipidemia and flag them. “AI has a database of thousands of patients in the Indian context, and the details provide markers and aberrations which also helps doctors,” he said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ai-helps-save-lives-in-critical-hours-find-ncds/articleshow/99310764.cms
2023-04-06,Facebook parent Meta reveals AI plans: Hereâ€™s what the company CTO has to say,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Facebook parent company Meta reportedly plans to commercialise its generative artificial intelligence ( AI ) technology by December and introduce it in advertising, which makes a sizable chunk of revenue. Andrew Bosworth, Meta's chief technology officer, told Nikkei Asia in an interview that the company’s “AI can improve an ad's effectiveness partly by telling the advertiser what tools to use in making it.” Meta offers advertising options on both Facebook and Instagram . ""[I] expect we'll start seeing some of them [commercialization of the tech] this year. We just created a new team, the generative AI team, a couple of months ago; they are very busy,"" Bosworth was quoted as saying. The executive also noted that instead of a company using a single image in an advertising campaign, it can ""ask the AI, 'Make images for my company that work for different audiences.' And it can save a lot of time and money."" AI keeping CEO Mark Zuckerberg busy According to Bosworth, he, along with CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox are “probably” spending the most time [in] AI. He also said that the company “are at the very forefront [in this space]."" he said. ""Quite a few of the techniques that are in large language model development were pioneered [by] our teams,” Bosworth was quoted as saying. Meta began full-scale AI research in 2013 and has published a number of studies ""We've been investing in artificial intelligence for over a decade, and have one of the leading research institutes in the world,"" Bosworth said, adding that the country has “a large research organisation, hundreds of people."" Earlier this year, Meta also announced that it will establish a new organisation to develop generative AI. AI in Metaverse According to the executive, the technology will also be used in the metaverse, a project in which the company has invested billions. ""So previously, if I wanted to create a 3D world, I needed to learn a lot of computer graphics and programming. In the future, you might be able to just describe the world you want to create and have the large language model generate that world for you. And so it makes things like content creation much more accessible to more people,"" he said. Bosworth highlighted that it was “very important” to invest in responsible development.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//gadgets-news/facebook-parent-meta-reveals-ai-plans-heres-what-the-company-cto-has-to-say/articleshow/99281822.cms

2023-04-04,Assess impact of AI tech: IT honchos,Sindhu Hariharan,"TENKASI: Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu along with technocrats Sharad Sharma (co-founder of iSPIRT Foundation) and Rajiv Kumar (former VC of Niti Aayog & current chairman of Pahle India Foundation) have signed a petition urging Indian authorities to assess impact of AI (artificial intelligence) advancements on the country. The move comes after Elon Musk and AI experts recently called for a pause on training advanced AI systems. The Indian petition has urged authorities to come up with a framework that could help the global community to engage and agree upon ""the rules of the game"" for future development of AI along the same lines as agreements made in the past on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The development comes at a time when OpenAI, Microsoft and others have been developing generative AI models at a pace too fast for ethical, regulatory and safety concerns to be considered. The petition calls for IT researchers, policymakers, academicians, industry leaders and members of civil society in India to participate in the debate ""to help evolve a national consensus on how best to utilise this powerful technology"". ""The emergence of powerful AI, with all its transformational potential, could also be the harbinger of chaotic - and potentially catastrophic - consequences for humanity. Finding an answer to this existential question is a categorical imperative for all nations including India,"" the letter read. While admitting that AI applications are important for India, the petitioners note that the effects of adopting the tech without due diligence and appropriate safeguards can disrupt social order. Addressing media in Tenkasi on Monday at an event announcing Zoho's rural initiatives, Vembu said strides made by AI-powered conversational platforms such as ChatGPT could kill ""millions of jobs"" at developers/coders' level. ""We are calling for a regulatory framework to demand transparency from all players who are operating here. Play by our rules to do business here, that's fair right,"" he said. ""Something like an ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce) must be planned for AI,"" added Vembu, who is also on the country's National Security Advisory board.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/assess-impact-of-ai-tech-it-honchos/articleshow/99226041.cms

2023-04-01,"Italy temporarily blocks ChatGPT, here's why",AP,"ROME: Italy is temporarily blocking the artificial intelligence software ChatGPT in the wake of a data breach as it investigates a possible violation of stringent European Union data protection rules, the government's privacy watchdog said Friday. The Italian Data Protection Authority said it was taking provisional action ""until ChatGPT respects privacy,"" including temporarily limiting the company from processing Italian users' data. U.S.-based OpenAI, which developed ChatGPT, didn't return a request for comment Friday. While some public schools and universities around the world have blocked the ChatGPT website from their local networks over student plagiarism concerns, it was not immediately clear when or how Italy would block it at a nationwide level. The move also is unlikely to affect applications from companies that already have licenses with OpenAI to use the same technology driving the chatbot, such as Microsoft's Bing search engine. The AI systems that power such chatbots, known as large language models, are able to mimic human writing styles based on the huge trove of digital books and online writings they have ingested. The Italian watchdog said OpenAI must report within 20 days what measures it has taken to ensure the privacy of users' data or face a fine of up to either 20 million euros (nearly $22 million) or 4% of annual global revenue. The agency's statement cites the EU's General Data Protection Regulation and noted that ChatGPT suffered a data breach on March 20 involving ""users' conversations"" and information about subscriber payments. OpenAI earlier announced that it had to take ChatGPT offline on March 20 to fix a bug that allowed some people to see the titles, or subject lines, of other users' chat history. ""Our investigation has also found that 1.2% of ChatGPT Plus users might have had personal data revealed to another user,"" the company said. ""We believe the number of users whose data was actually revealed to someone else is extremely low and we have contacted those who might be impacted."" Italy's privacy watchdog lamented the lack of a legal basis to justify OpenAI's ""massive collection and processing of personal data"" used to train the platform's algorithms and that the company does not notify users whose data it collects. The agency also said ChatGPT can sometimes generate - and store - false information about individuals. Finally, it noted there's no system to verify users' ages, exposing children to responses ""absolutely inappropriate to their age and awareness."" The watchdog's move comes as concerns grow about the artificial intelligence boom. A group of scientists and tech industry leaders published a letter Wednesday calling for companies such as OpenAI to pause the development of more powerful AI models until the fall to give time for society to weigh the risks. The president of Italy's privacy watchdog agency told Italian state TV Friday evening he was one of those who signed the appeal. Pasquale Stanzione said he did so because ""it's not clear what aims are being pursued"" ultimately by those developing AI. If AI should ""impinge"" on a person's ""self-determination"" then ""this is very dangerous,'' Stanzione said. He also described the absence of filters for users younger than 13 as ""rather grave."" Others were citing concerns, too. ""While it is not clear how enforceable these decisions will be, the very fact that there seems to be a mismatch between the technological reality on the ground and the legal frameworks of Europe"" shows there may be something to the letter's call for a pause ""to allow for our cultural tools to catch up,"" said Nello Cristianini, an AI professor at the University of Bath. San Francisco-based OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman , announced this week that he's embarking on a six-continent trip in May to talk about the technology with users and developers. That includes a stop planned for Brussels, where European Union lawmakers have been negotiating sweeping new rules to limit high-risk AI tools, as well as visits to Madrid, Munich, London and Paris. European consumer group BEUC called Thursday for EU authorities and the bloc's 27 member nations to investigate ChatGPT and similar AI chatbots. BEUC said it could be years before the EU's AI legislation takes effect, so authorities need to act faster to protect consumers from possible risks. ""In only a few months, we have seen a massive take-up of ChatGPT, and this is only the beginning,"" Deputy Director General Ursula Pachl said. Waiting for the EU's AI Act ""is not good enough as there are serious concerns growing about how ChatGPT and similar chatbots might deceive and manipulate people.""",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//gadgets-news/italy-temporarily-blocks-chatgpt-heres-why/articleshow/99155198.cms

That format has changed because right now, I focus on being a 26-year-old. A good son, a great friend... basically the best possible human that I can be. And my music is just a reflection of that. While I’m living like any other 26-year-old, I hope that enough things happen in my life and it comes through in my music organically,” says Ritviz, who is best known for his tracks Udd Gaye , Jeet, Sage, among others, AI as a helping tool While his creative process has already undergone a transformation, Ritviz says he’s open to trying his hand at new technologies such as AI. “I came across a tweet recently, which said, ‘I asked Chat GPT to make a Ritviz song’ and it did. I found it fascinating that it had studied the pattern with which I make music. “I don’t know how AI could help my music-making process just yet, but I’m open to anything that may make my process easier. So, if I could delegate work to AI, I could get more headspace to ideate. So, let it become a part of our lives, but look at it as an additional helping tool. People shouldn’t think it will give us the whole product. Use it like an advanced, smarter version of your laptop or workstation to get your work done,” he says. Staying desi Ritviz has stayed rooted with his blend of desi and electronic beats. “The USP was set from the beginning and I think it did help me stand out. I grew up with a strong base in Indian classical music and later in life, I listened to a lot of hip-hop and pop. So, I was organically producing the music I was listening to... Staying close to my roots gives me my identity. I live this life – it’s not just in the music I make, it’s even in the kurta I wear.” ‘ MimMi is for my mother’ “Mimmi is my mom’s nickname. This album is an ode to her. In the last couple of years, I really started changing the way I wrote music. I used to write imagining things that I desired. Now, I have started writing by taking things out of my personal life. This album is a product of that. It’s the conversations that I have had with my mother during the pandemic. After every talk, I would see myself writing a new song. That’s how the whole album took shape.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/music/ai-can-free-headspace-for-ideation-ritviz/articleshow/99156064.cms
2023-03-31,Stop OpenAI from releasing more ChatGPT version: US group to FTC,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"An artificial intelligence-focused tech ethics group has asked the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate ChatGPT maker OpenAI for violating consumer protection rules. The Center for AI and Digital Policy (CAIDP)'s complaint to FTC argues that the organisation’s rollout of AI text generation tools has been “biassed, deceptive, and a risk to public safety.” Microsoft-backed OpenAI unveiled the fourth iteration of its GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) AI programme earlier this month. Top Picks For You Bard using ChatGPT data for training: This is what Google has to say Why Elon Musk, Apple co-founder and others want to put a 'pause' on ChatGPT-like models GPT-4 is a new language model created by OpenAI that can generate text that is said to be similar to human speech.

The outputs cannot be proven or replicated. No independent assessment was undertaken prior to deployment. OpenAl has acknowledged the specific dangers of ""Disinformation and influence operations,"" *Proliferation of conventional and unconventional weapons,"" and "" Cybersecurity ."" OpenAl has warned that ""AI systems will have even greater potential to reinforce entire ideologies, worldviews, truths and untruths, and to cement them or lock them in, foreclosing future contestation, reflection, and improvement."" The company already disclaims liability for the consequences that may follow. 2. The Federal Trade Commission has declared that the use of Al should be ""transparent, explainable, fair, and empirically sound while fostering accountability."" OpenAl's product GPT-4 satisfies none of these requirements. It is time for the FTC to act. There should be independent oversight and evaluation of commercial Al products offered in the United States.

2023-03-26,Phishers' latest weapon: ChatGPT,Paul John&Ashish Chauhan,"Representative Image AHMEDABAD: Since the artificial intelligence-driven chatbot tool ChatGPT rolled out last November, many of us have used it as a creative partner for everything from gripping screenplays to eloquent letters. Cyber scammers are now harnessing AI's power to create phishing emails embedded with malicious code. Earlier, the lack of proficiency in language and culture was a significant hurdle for scammers, who struggled to make their emails realistic enough to hook their targets. However, this February, an officer from Mumbai police's cyber cell arrived in Gujarat , following the trail of phishing scammers ""who had used ChatGPT to draft two business emails and five SMSes "". The Mumbai police were tracking an email written on behalf of a non-existent 'Bhakti Enterprises' from Patan dealing in spices, said a senior Gujarat CID crime officer. ""The Mumbai firm lost lakhs to the cybercrooks. The police interrogated some suspects and found that the cyber criminals had used the AI tool to mimic the language and tone of authentic business emails as well as the SMSes,"" the officer said. Phishing attacks are emails or other messages that attempt to fool their recipients into clicking on a seemingly innocuous document or website link, which then attempts to install malware on the user's device. Between January 2022 and February 1 this year, the CID Crime branch received 938 complaints regarding fake emails. Of this, 90 were categorized as business enterprise emails impersonating senior officials. Most of these emails were sent by scamsters offering cryptocurrencies or posing as agricultural traders, officials from petrochemical companies, vehicle part sellers etc. These emails were sent from fake addresses that appeared to be from legitimate companies, making it difficult for the victims to identify them as fake. Still, what worries the Gujarat police are phishing gangs using AI tools to draft flawless business emails and SMSes. ""Not all hackers are fluent in English, which works against them. Most organizations look for unconventional uses of grammar and unusual wording to weed out phishing emails. But ChatGPT fixes this issue, making messages appear more genuine, and therefore far more likely to be successful as the basis of an attack,"" said the CID officer. ""A simple query raised with keywords like 'draft business letter with client's name 'XYZ' to buy 200 scooters, send cheque number, photo of cheque, GST number' was enough for ChatGPT to generate a professional email,"" added the CID officer. Cybercrime consultant for Jaipur police Mukesh Chaudhry told TOI, ""Basic work and security protocols should be in place while dealing with emails. There must be a timely update regarding changing trends of crime. The capabilities of employees and team members to recognize frauds must be upscaled."" He added that the phishing gangs are located in Bihar, Jharkhand, and villages situated at the trijunction of Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Now, they have started operating from north-eastern states like Tripura and Mizoram. Sumit Mishra, director of DoT Gujarat, told TOI, ""Any customer care SMS coming from a 10-digit number should be considered a scam. Genuine SMSes do not contain links. According to the latest TRAI regulations, messages are required to be sent via alphanumeric short codes.""",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/phishers-latest-weapon-chatgpt/articleshow/99003106.cms
2023-03-25,Microsoft threatens to restrict data from rival AI search tools,Bloomberg,"Microsoft Corp has threatened to cut off access to its internet-search data, which it licenses to rival search engines, if they don’t stop using it as the basis for their own artificial intelligence chat products, according to people familiar with the dispute. The software maker licenses the data in its Bing search index — a map of the internet that can be quickly scanned in real time — to other companies that offer web search, such as Apollo Global Management Inc.’s Yahoo and DuckDuckGo. In February, Microsoft integrated a cousin of ChatGPT, OpenAI’s AI-powered chat technology, into Bing. Rivals quickly moved to roll out their own AI chatbots as hype built around the buzzy technology. This week, Alphabet Inc’s Google publicly released Bard, its conversational AI product. DuckDuckGo, a search engine that emphasizes privacy, introduced DuckAssist, a feature that uses artificial intelligence to summarize answers to search queries. You.com and Neeva Inc — two newer search engines that debuted in 2021 — have also debuted AI-fueled search services, YouChat and NeevaAI. These search chatbots aim to combine the conversational skills of ChatGPT with the information provided by a conventional search engine. DuckDuckGo, You.com and Neeva’s regular search engines all use Bing to provide some of their information, because indexing the entire web is costly — it requires servers to store data and a constant crawl of the internet to incorporate updates. It would be similarly complex and pricey to get together that data for a search chatbot. Microsoft has told at least two customers that using its Bing search index to feed their AI chat tools violates the terms of their contract, according to the people, who spoke anonymously because they were discussing a confidential dispute. The Redmond, Washington-based tech company said it may terminate the licenses providing access to its search index, the people said. Microsoft didn’t have an immediate comment. If they were cut off from Microsoft’s index, smaller search engines would have a hard time finding an alternative. Microsoft and Google are the only two companies that index the entire web, and Google’s limitations on the use of its index have led nearly all other search engines to use Bing.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/microsoft-threatens-to-restrict-data-from-rival-ai-search-tools/articleshow/98983470.cms
2023-03-25,"""AI is equally beneficial for employers and employees""",TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"TeamLease HRtech is a part of TeamLease Group , one of India’s largest providers of a wide range of HR technology products. The company is among the country's biggest HR Technology organizations with over 2 million employees on the HCM platform. It claims to offers 600 modules in the employee lifecycle from pre-hire to post-retire including core HR, benefits, and compliance on state-of-the-art cloud native mobile technology. In an interaction with Times of India, Sumit Sabharwal , CEO of TeamLease HRtech Ltd talks about how AI tech like ChatGPT may change and impact HRtech and more. Q. How do you see the role of AI in HRtech grow in the next couple of years? Artificial Intelligence has a lot of potential in HR Technology. It has many use cases to make HR managers' jobs more efficient. For instance, modern applicant tracking systems are already using AI to sort, analyse, and select appropriate resumes during the initial stages of recruitment. Similarly, AI-enabled HR tech products can address candidate queries, schedule their interviews, and even assist them during the onboarding process; without any manual intervention. In future, we will see AI's application in many more HR functions like training and development, employee engagement, performance management, compliance, etc. Q. If we talk of AI alone, do you think it is beneficial to companies more, or talent? AI is equally beneficial for employers and employees. For employees, it increases engagement, accuracy, and throughput. Whereas, for employers, it delivers higher profitability with the help of increased employee efficiency and productivity. Q. What, according to you, are the pros and cons of use — and dependence — of technology in HR? As per research, HR technology brings upto 21% improvement in administrative efficiency, up to 30% savings in time and cost, and up to 65% reduction in errors and duplication. In other words, HR technology improves an organization from multiple fronts. If we talk about the cons, we can say that HR technology has not achieved the level of intuitiveness where HR professionals can use it completely without any external help. As a result, sometimes they need an introductory demo or small training session during new HR tech implementations in the organisation. However, HR technology is evolving rapidly to become more and more intuitive to its users. Q. ChatGPT has been in the news quite a bit recently. How do you see the role of ChatGPT — if any — in HRtech? ChatGPT is a product that uses generative AI. As the name suggests, the tech can be used to generate new content including text, images, audios, videos, etc. So, in HRtech, it can be used to fulfil content requirements like writing emails, developing L&D programs, posting job openings, solving employee queries proactively, etc. The HR space can reap numerous benefits with advancement in HR tech products accelerated by Chat GPT and other similar generative AI technologies. Most of the value will be unlocked by integrating it with other products, like API integration to exchange data and interact with other systems, Chatbot Platform Integration to build conversational interfaces, virtual assistant integration to provide voice-based conversational interfaces and so on. Companies can feed their data to the system and train it for the needed objectives and NLP will ensure that the processed outputs are in the required format. Ultimately, the integrated HR tech products can interact with the database for inputs and outputs to automate and improve various tasks of HR management.

2023-03-24,Trump arrested? Putin jailed? Fake AI images spread online,AP,"NEW YORK: Former US President Donald Trump getting gang-tackled by riot-gear-clad New York City police officers. Russian President Vladimir Putin in prison grays behind the bars of a dimly lit concrete cell. The highly detailed, sensational images have inundated Twitter and other platforms in recent days, amid news that Trump faces possible criminal charges and the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin. But neither visual is remotely real. The images - and scores of variations littering social media - were produced using increasingly sophisticated and widely accessible image generators powered by artificial intelligence. Misinformation experts warn the images are harbingers of a new reality: waves of fake photos and videos flooding social media after major news events and further muddying fact and fiction at crucial times for society. ""It does add noise during crisis events. It also increases the cynicism level,"" said Jevin West, a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle who focuses on the spread of misinformation. ""You start to lose trust in the system and the information that you are getting."" While the ability to manipulate photos and create fake images isn't new, AI image generator tools by Midjourney , DALL-E and others are easier to use. They can quickly generate realistic images - complete with detailed backgrounds - on a mass scale with little more than a simple text prompt from users. Some of the recent images have been driven by this month's release of a new version of Midjourney's text-to-image synthesis model, which can, among other things, now produce convincing images mimicking the style of news agency photos. In one widely-circulating Twitter thread, Eliot Higgins, founder of Bellingcat, a Netherlands-based investigative journalism collective, used the latest version of the tool to conjure up scores of dramatic images of Trump's fictional arrest. The visuals, which have been shared and liked tens of thousands of times, showed a crowd of uniformed officers grabbing the Republican billionaire and violently pulling him down onto the pavement. Higgins, who was also behind a set of images of Putin being arrested, put on trial and then imprisoned, says he posted the images with no ill intent. He even stated clearly in his Twitter thread that the images were AI-generated. Still, the images were enough to get him locked out of the Midjourney server, according to Higgins. The San Francisco-based independent research lab didn't respond to emails seeking comment. ""The Trump arrest image was really just casually showing both how good and bad Midjourney was at rendering real scenes,"" Higgins wrote in an email. ""The images started to form a sort of narrative as I plugged in prompts to Midjourney, so I strung them along into a narrative, and decided to finish off the story."" He pointed out the images are far from perfect: in some, Trump is seen, oddly, wearing a police utility belt. In others, faces and hands are clearly distorted. But it's not enough that users like Higgins clearly state in their posts that the images are AI-generated and solely for entertainment, says Shirin Anlen, media technologist at Witness, a New York-based human rights organization that focuses on visual evidence. Too often, the visuals are quickly reshared by others without that crucial context, she said. Indeed, an Instagram post sharing some of Higgins' images of Trump as if they were genuine garnered more than 79,000 likes. ""You're just seeing an image, and once you see something, you cannot unsee it,"" Anlen said. In another recent example, social media users shared a synthetic image supposedly capturing Putin kneeling and kissing the hand of Chinese leader Xi Jinping . The image, which circulated as the Russian president welcomed Xi to the Kremlin this week, quickly became a crude meme. It's not clear who created the image or what tool they used, but some clues gave the forgery away. The heads and shoes of the two leaders were slightly distorted, for example, and the room's interior didn't match the room where the actual meeting took place. With synthetic images becoming increasingly difficult to discern from the real thing, the best way to combat visual misinformation is better public awareness and education, experts say. ""It's just becoming so easy and it's so cheap to make these images that we should do whatever we can to make the public aware of how good this technology has gotten,"" West said. Higgins suggests social media companies could focus on developing technology to detect AI-generated images and integrate that into their platforms. Twitter has a policy banning ""synthetic, manipulated, or out-of-context media"" with the potential to deceive or harm. Annotations from Community Notes, Twitter's crowd-sourced fact checking project, were attached to some tweets to include the context that the Trump images were AI-generated. When reached for comment Thursday, the company emailed back only an automated response. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined to comment. Some of the fabricated Trump images were labeled as either ""false"" or ""missing context"" through its third-party fact-checking program, of which the AP is a participant. Arthur Holland Michel, a fellow at the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs in New York who is focused on emerging technologies, said he worries the world isn't ready for the impending deluge. He wonders how deepfakes involving ordinary people - harmful fake pictures of an ex-partner or a colleague, for example - will be regulated. ""From a policy perspective, I'm not sure we're prepared to deal with this scale of disinformation at every level of society,"" Michel wrote in an email. ""My sense is that it's going to take an as-yet-unimagined technical breakthrough to definitively put a stop to this.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/trump-arrested-putin-jailed-fake-ai-images-spread-online/articleshow/98955907.cms
2023-03-23,"Mumbai: Now, AI detects tuberculosis in asymptomatic patients",TNN,"Image used for representative purpose only MUMBAI: Artificial intelligence has boosted detection of tuberculosis in the city in the last two years even among those with no outward symptoms of the deadly disease, according to civic doctors. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare told TOI, ""Around 35% of our confirmed TB cases were incidentally detected, that is they were a part of a non-TB group of patients."" In other words, these were patients who visited the civic healthcare setup for complaints other than TB but underwent an X-ray scan that was analysed by an AI software. In 2021 and 2022, over 1 lakh people underwent AI-supported X-ray scans for TB at nine BMC-run hospitals as a part of the pilot study. The BMC tied up with qure.ai, a digital health startup company, for the study. The company's AI-based software, developed after scanning lakhs of TB chest X-ray reports, would flag off chest X-ray scans that presumably looked like TB patches. ""AI-based screening is very useful for us to make an early diagnosis even when the patient perhaps has little symptoms,'' said Dr Gomare. Dr Shibu Vijayan of qure.ai said that studies have shown that almost 40% of the TB patients are asymptomatic in early days. ""Unless a patient is symptomatic, he or she would not be asked to undergo a sputum test. But with AI-supported X-ray scans, one can detect TB at the earliest and ensure treatment starts early,'' said Dr Vijayan. In 2022, 57,781 patients were screened using the AI-supported X-ray scanners at the civic hospitals that were a part of the pilot project. Of these, the AI software flagged off 10,225 as having presumptive TB. ""Once we get the AI diagnosis, we call back the patient for a clinical evaluation,'' said a civic health official. Thus, 9,702 out of the 10,225 presumed TB patients were asked to return for sputum collection that would help confirm the TB diagnosis. However, only 2,376 turned up for sputum collection, and 704 of them turned out to have a confirmed TB diagnosis. Although the pilot programme is over, the BMC is likely to tie up with AI companies on a long-term basis. The BMC has recorded over 65,000 TB cases in 2022-2023 that is the highest annual detection ever so far. In 2021-2022, the BMC had picked up 58,221 confirmed TB cases.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-now-ai-detects-tuberculosis-in-asymptomatic-patients/articleshow/98927623.cms

2023-03-16,Travel time may reduce as tender floated for 165 AI-powered signals in Bengaluru,Sanika Athavale,"BENGALURU: If all goes as per plan, the city may have a traffic signalling system powered by artificial intelligence by 2025. Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited has floated a tender for AI-based upgradation of 165 traffic signals and March 30 is the last date to submit bids. The Adaptive Traffic Control System ( ATCS ) technology will be applied to the junctions in about 17 corridors. ""Bengaluru has either fixed-time signals or manually operated ones. The new technology will set the timings based on vehicular inflow as the signals will talk to each other and prioritise freeing up high-density corridors. Bengaluru, which recently gained the notoriety of being the second-most congested city in the world, could really benefit from smart traffic signals. Largely dependent on private vehicles in the absence of adequate public transport infrastructure, commuters lose crucial time at junctions, which in turn leads to higherstress levels and lower productivity. By curtailing the waiting period, the AI-based system will also help tackle pollution. Though it’s still early days, authorities should focus on timely completion of the project to prevent cost overruns and ensure efficient utilisation of taxpayers’ money. Time view This will lead to optimisation of time. If you save 10 seconds at 10 signals, it may seem like just 100 seconds, but it is a considerable amount of travel time,"" elaborated Rathnakar Reddy , transportation expert at Infra Support Engineering Consultants Pvt Ltd, the firm hired by the state for preparing the detailed project report. As per the tender issued earlier in March, companies are invited to bid for the work of upgrading and synchronising 136 existing traffic signals to adaptive traffic controlling, along with applying the ATCS tech to 29 new signals at junctions that are currently 'unsignalised'. Reddy said: ""Unsignalised means a junction or median that is currently operating without a signal."" Upgradation of traffic signals is the next big project to be undertaken for improving Bengaluru's vehicular and pedestrian traffic movement after MA Saleem took charge as the special commissioner of police (traffic). ATCS will also have an Emergency Vehicle Priority System that will create a green corridor for ambulances, fire engines and other such vehicles. The emergency vehicles will need to install Bengaluru Traffic Police (BTP)-approved transponders that will help the ATCS sense the vehicle and manage its movement without the emergency responders needing to communicate with BTP. Some basic software components of ATCS are Composite Signalling Cost Strategy application and Traffic Signal Monitoring and Managing Software under the software suite provided by Centre for Development of Advanced Computing. Cameras, transponders, cables, timers, solar panels etc. are needed for building ATCS infrastructure.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/travel-time-may-reduce-as-tender-floated-for-165-ai-powered-signals-in-bengaluru/articleshow/98679792.cms
2023-03-15,"How Indian artists are using AI, AR to let creativity soar",Mohua Das,"Would Impressionists like Monet and Renoir have existed had it not been for the invention of the portable paint tubes that allowed them to escape the studio, take inspiration from the world outdoors and experiment with new lightfast pigments invented by industrial chemists in the 19th century? What would have become of the ‘60s pop art movement had Andy Warhol not discovered silkscreen printing, the process of transferring images from magazines or newspapers to canvas? Closer home, one wouldn’t have known the artistic possibilities with the camera till Akbar Padamsee in 1969 recreated one of his own paintings of an abstract landscape using projected light, tinted filters, stencils and photographic slides. Misunderstood and rejected then, it started art’s tryst with technology in India. The debate over how much technology is too much technology within the fine art realm has been an ongoing one but art and tech have always made for inspiring bedfellows even as purists remained wary of machine intrusion. From painting with a stylus on a tablet to immersive augmented reality art, 3D-printed sculptures to paintings created by codes and algorithms, for adventurous artists, tech has been more than a tool. JENNY BHATT : TECH TONIC For Mumbai-based pop surrealist artist Jenny Bhatt, the “web3-based metaverse” has been a new home for her art since she introduced augmented reality (AR) to her digital interactive art project ‘MokshaShots’ about a year ago. In her latest in the series — ‘Metamind: Infinite Possibility’ an acrylic on canvas piece that is part of the Art of India (AoI) week-long showcase that starts in Mumbai on March 19 — Bhatt uses digital layers to bring motifs of infinity, metaverse, and the human mind to life. “When a viewer trains their phone lens on it, parts of the piece start animating,” says Bhatt, enthused by the AR technology of adding virtual elements like animation and 3D objects that can enhance her artwork’s meaning. “I can innovate in a way that I can’t with traditional media. It’s not limited by space or location and the viewer is a participant, taking the story forward by the choices they make on their device. ” JAIDEEP MEHROTRA: DIGITAL BRUSH A trailblazer of this hybrid artform, Jaideep Mehrotra, has been tapping the potential of blending age-old art techniques with new-age technology since the ‘90s. “Most of my life I’d been working with the ‘goonga medium’ or paintings that are essentially mute,” he says. That is before an Apple Powermac replaced his easel, a digital pen his paintbrush and catalysed his move into computer-generated lithographs and video art installations, undeterred by conservatives who called it a “gimmick”. His latest is a time-lapse infinite loop video titled ‘Within’ that will take viewers at the AOI on a kaleidoscopic journey through vignettes of people, places and things. “It depicts the preoccupation of metropolises and similarity of lives around the globe,” he says, describing the new perspectives that the digital medium affords him. “Artists should use whatever visual language is available to them to allow the message to slide in. ” Yet, some are worried by artificial intelligence (AI) tools that can convert text into immaculate images in seconds. Bhatt, despite her experiments with digital art for over two decades, feels apprehensive about the ethics surrounding AI art. “I’ve always been excited about what tech can do for art including creative coding that NFT artists use to generate random visual outputs. But not machine-generated AI art. That feels like a breach of another artist’s copyright,” she maintains. Mehrotra, on the other hand, finds AI an “amazing new addition” that needs to be investigated, not brushed aside. “Art has no parameters. The moment you create parameters you destroy it. To celebrate art, people have to be open to different realms. ” PRATEEK ARORA : SCI-FI MEETS AI While the jury is still out, AI has definitely altered the rules of creativity. Screenwriter Prateek Arora is one of those unlikely artists who uses AI as his muse. “I was always interested in science fiction, fantasy and horror but as a writer and creator, shows that I pitched for in that genre were seen as too experimental and risky. ” Until AI happened to him six months ago and took his artistic vision beyond what he had imagined. Now, his photoreal AI creations of fantastical and alien creatures that merge Indian aesthetics with horror and sci-fi have gone viral. “I’ve also had interest from directors and producers from the south Asian diaspora,” says Arora, who dismisses critics who deem this artform ‘unoriginal’. “No one can be the arbiter of what art is or isn’t. Isn’t art after all a rapid iteration of what you see around you, getting inspired and executing that with your own originality?” he stresses.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/how-indian-artists-are-using-ai-ar-to-let-creativity-soar/articleshow/98644302.cms
2023-03-15,Goa Police to use AI to crack down on traffic violations at Merces junction,Murari Shetye,"PANAJI: The state government has decided to introduce an AI-driven security and integrated traffic management system at Merces on pilot basis. If successful, the project will be implemented across the state for traffic management and issuing of e-challan in real time. A senior official said the technology will also reduce toxic emissions as vehicle idling time will be reduced. The pilot is being carried out at Merces junction , one of the busiest in Goa. The AI system observed traffic there for two weeks using 16 cameras. After the initial two weeks, signal lights were activated in phases, under the supervision of local traffic authorities. Over the next three weeks, the AI improved further, officials said, adding that the results of the project have been in line with the government’s expectations. A senior official said that with AI, peak wait-time at the junction, which was 12-15 minutes, was reduced to 4-6 minutes. Earlier, there used to be four constables managing traffic at the junction, but there’s now only one, that too as a precaution. The AI system can detect emergency vehicles and automatically clears the road for them. It is designed in such a way that all signals in the network constantly communicate with each other, thus optimising traffic not only at specific junctions but at a wider level. “AI can also detect which vehicles violate traffic rules and make the road unsafe for everyone. An e-challan is automatically sent to such offenders,” a senior official said. All data from the signals is available in real-time at the government’s central command and control centres. “This can be used for public safety. Signals can also be controlled remotely,” he said. Multiple companies were invited to carry out a pilot project in Goa. Of the many companies, only one agreed to do the pilot for free. Incidentally, this company had also successfully demonstrated to have reduced traffic congestion in Bengaluru by over 42%. “The company was ready to bear the cost of all capital and operating expenses, and work with the government on a PPP model,” he said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/police-to-use-ai-to-crack-down-on-traffic-violations-at-merces-jn/articleshow/98640851.cms
2023-03-14,How AI traffic system is helping cops solve cases in Noida,Aditya Dev,"NOIDA: Since the launch of the Integrated Safety and Traffic Management System ( ISTMS ) in May last year, over 2.2 lakh challans have been issued to traffic violators over the last 10 months in Noida. The system has also helped resolve 200 police cases and track people uploading stunt videos. With its success, cops are now hoping that ISTMS will be replicated in Greater Noida as well. On Monday, police commissioner Laxmi Singh said the AI-enabled ISTMS cameras are designed to detect traffic violations of speed limit, red lights and stop lanes and offences such as helmet-less travel, triple-riding, use of mobile phones while driving and driving without seatbelts. Challans are issued through SMSes to mobile phones. “But Noida police has also used the footage from these cameras to crack several criminal cases. It is a successful model. So, there is a need to increase the number of cameras in the city, especially central Noida, and roll out the smart traffic system in Greater Noida as well,” she said. Recently, the ISTMS cameras came in handy for cops to track a black Scorpio, which did not have a registration plate number and was used for a stunt, she said. “We also issued challans to people performing stunts in Sector 39 and near Amity College and seized superbikes for stunts on Yamuna Expressway.” Noida Authority’s DGM Rajesh Kumar said nearly 200 crime cases, including robbery, snatching and kidnapping, have been solved with the help of ISTMS since May last year. “Every day, police are taking assistance from ISTMS in three-four cases. Recently, a gang of kidnappers was identified with its help. It also helps us to keep a tab near schools, colleges and public places.” A total of 1,065 hi-tech cameras were installed at 82 locations in Noida under the ISTMS. The traffic department data shows 14,313 challans were issued in the first month after the cameras were installed. In the next months, the number of challans increased—28,379 in June, 33,448 in July, 24,224 in August and 34,797 in September last year. A dip was reported between October 2022 and January 2023 when 15,000 to 18,000 challans were issued. Last month, 22,739 challans were issued. The ISTMS camera feed is monitored 24x7 from the Sector 94 command centre. Now, plans are afoot to install 450 more cameras under the Safe City project. Noida Authority has issued a request for a proposal for hiring a consultant.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/how-ai-traffic-system-is-helping-cops-solve-cases/articleshow/98619608.cms

2023-03-11,"People look for the experience, they donâ€™t want robots in bars: Indiaâ€™s first woman bartender",Fathima Ashraf,"Artificial intelligence is booming, transforming every walk of life, including hospitality. The future of mixology and the role of AI in it was one of the key topics addressed during the Women in Mixology panel discussion held in Bengaluru on Wednesday, featuring India’s first woman bartender, Shatbhi Basu , hospitality professional Aslam Gafoor , entrepreneur Ajay Gowda , among others. And the collective opinion was the need to find the right balance. Held as part of Women’s Day celebrations, the event also had six women mixologists from across India. AI good for the backend According to Shatbhi, while AI is good for fast food outlets, it’s not ideal for places where people come looking for an experience – such as bars. “I think AI is great for airports, cinema halls, etc., – places where you may want something quick. In the case of bartending, sure it can be used behind the scenes, to understand how to make your bar more efficient, package your backend costing, to come up with one-liners for cocktails and the like – but not in the forefront.” According to Shatbhi, even if people begin to introduce AI in bartending, it won’t last. “It may cost people their jobs in the beginning but soon, everyone will realise that it is not working. When you deal with a human bartender, you can communicate your needs and make requests for changes. But with AI taking over, you’ll reach a stage where you’ll have to accept everything that’s dished out to you. There are people around who don’t like the idea of a restaurant where you have to scan QR codes for the menu. People look for the experience, they don’t want robots in bars,” she added. The balance between AI and human touch The audience, however, had divided opinions. While some said the introduction of AI will take away the creativity from the field, some others opined that AI could help in creating personalised experiences, making the processes involved more efficient. While AI is a great concept, the importance of the human element can’t be overlooked. Urging for the need to find a balance, Aslam said, “AI is here, and it’s here to stay. Now, it’s up to us to find a balance between the two, to cater to the customers the best way possible. The human touch and feel combined with the possibilities of the AI will bring forth the best experience.” AI revolution across the world Enabled by AI, apps, kiosks and chatbots are revolutionising the consumer experience across the world. Launched last year by an Israeli startup, the world’s first robotic bartender, Cecelia.ai, provides interactive drink service for customers, complete with jokes, an ID scanner, fluency in over 40 languages and the ability to make up to 120 drinks in an hour. Recently, two British developers introduced A.I. Bar, a feature that helps bartenders keep track of customers using facial recognition, ensuring faster service and less wait time for customers. Besides, there are features available where customers request for drinks digitally and AI, which recognises the drink offers them the specials promoted with text, graphics and video.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/events/bangalore/people-look-for-the-experience-they-dont-want-robots-in-bars-indias-first-woman-bartender/articleshow/98544066.cms
2023-03-06,ChatGPT comes to the rescue amid mass layoffs,Yvonne Jacob,"You may have heard it by now. In a development that only those youngsters preparing for the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) exams can sympathise with, ChatGPT, the chatbot that has been on an exam-clearing spree since it went viral, failed to clear the UPSC prelims. That doesn’t make it totally useless though. You can still use the AI tool to get help with other things, particularly for professional benefit. From job-hunting, to writing resumes and hiring a potential candidate, here’s how people are using ChatGPT amid mass layoffs across the globe. Prepare for an interview ChatGPT is also being used to prepare for interviews with a list of mock questions that are likely to be asked. “I asked ChatGPT to give me a sample answer for a question asking how I adapted to a job in another company, and it gave me a detailed sample answer for it. I think this exercise can be helpful because it helped me understand how comprehensive I can be during an important interview,” shares Aman Jain, a social media content creator at a Pune-based company. The chatbot can also help you get acquainted with interview techniques like the STAR (situation, task, action, result) method by breaking it all down for you. I tried ChatGPT to suggest alternate job roles based on my interest in scuba diving, and it actually came up with very convincing options from dive tourism to underwater photography. I think it is a great tool because you get to know that your possibilities are endless — Nishant Sharma, operations manager at a software development firm Want to know more about the company you wish to join? Just enter a prompt asking ChatGPT who the CEO of the particular company is and it will collate information available online and present it in a digestible form. Moreover, it can also find job titles that are suitable for you based on your interests. Want better visibility amid thousands of job applications? Ask ChatGPT to refine your resume with the right prompts, like fashion design trainee Urvashi Kothari did. “It takes me a lot of time to update my resume whenever I change my job or need to apply to another workplace. ChatGPT significantly reduced my time by highlighting important skills from my resume so it could be more visible to a recruiter,” she says, adding that minor tweaking in the AI tool’s responses is required to add a personal touch. Want to recruit the perfect candidate? According to a report by Forbes, 40% of a recruiter’s time is spent entering data, sifting through a large number of resumes and scheduling interviews. Time that they could use to interact with candidates. A survey conducted by the recruiting company Harvey-Nash in 2019 suggests that 20% of companies use some level of AI technology in their recruiting process now. For example, a screening process done by an AI software can segregate candidates that may not fully match a company’s requirements. Recently, a New York-based entrepreneur, Roshan Patel, created a LinkedIn profile for a fictional founder of a company with the help of AI. The profile claimed that ‘Chad Smith’ was a Stanford University dropout and an ex-employee of a finance startup. Within 24 hours, Chad got a funding offer from a reputed venture capital firm that claimed that Chad’s co-workers had “great things to say” about him. Since then, details of the fake profile and the funding offer have gone viral on social media, garnering over 12 million views and 78.7K likes!",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/chatgpt-comes-to-the-rescue-amid-mass-layoffs/articleshow/98434969.cms

2023-02-28,"Youth makes waves with AI, ML inventions in Visakhapatnam",Umamaheswara Rao,"VISAKHAPATNAM: Curiosity towards technology coupled with practical competence are the qualities that have made Nikhil JSK , a 24-year-old Vizag youth, an inventor at such a young age. Nikhil is currently working as a software engineer at IBM in Bengaluru. The youth is part of a small group, which produced three technologies related to artificial intelligence and machine learning, which have been filed for patents with the United States Patent Office . The baby steps towards the innovation journey started as early as in his engineering days. He explored patentable technologies even during his engineering internship days. Speaking to ToI, Nikhil said he filed for the first patent in November 2020. ""At first, it seemed like a herculean task. But over time, I felt the patents are achievable for those having 'unity of invention'. A jury at IBM itself assesses the patentability of a technology or innovation before clearing it for patent filing. Even though the patent as property belongs to IBM and reserves all rights over it, I am being recognised as one of the inventors in these three patents. I worked as a full-time intern at IMB and simultaneously sat for my end-term examinations without attending any of the 6th semester classes during my engineering days. Despite this, I managed to score a 9.4 GPA in that semester and ended my academics with a CGPA of 9.6. I was awarded 'University Honor Roll' consecutively for the years 2016-17 and 2017-18,"" said Nikhil. Explaining his patent applications, Nikhil said one technology works on computerised assessment of articles with similar content and highlights distinctions. ""Another innovation is related to method and apparatus for clustering algorithm aberration identification. The third one is about identifying anomalies based on contours determined through previous false positives,"" said Nikhil. Raghunath Jonnavithula, father of Nikhil who is working as a general manager with a major jewellery outlet in Vizag, is a Guinness World Record holder.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/youth-makes-waves-with-ai-ml-inventions/articleshow/98288876.cms
2023-02-27,Task force to decide on Artificial intelligence syllabus,Poulami Roy,"Image used for representative purpose only KOLKATA: The state education department is planning to introduce artificial intelligence (AI) for good governance of schools and to include it in the school curriculum in the near future. A task force to explore possible usage of AI has been formed by the state higher education department which will submit its proposals before March 15 after which a blueprint is expected to be laid out. The eight-member task force includes heads of state-run boards, chairman of the expert committee and computer science experts. The committee members have been asked to “explore the possibility of using generative Artificial Intelligence” or AI based-tools in the education system. A meeting was held in the department a few days back where members were asked to find out every possibility of using AI for good governance. The circular said, “The task force is advised to submit its stakeholder-wise recommendations along with potential benefits of such recommendation for both schools and higher education sectors and suggested action plans to the administrative department preferably by March 15, 2023.” An education department official said, “The basic focus is to find out all possibilities to incorporate AI in our system and to make it smoother than before. There are several projects run under the education department, including students scholarships, distribution of student’s credit cardswhich are service-oriented schemes that can run perfectly with new-age technology. Thetask force members have also been asked to explore and reach out tostakeholders and explore latest technologies and their usage so that they can be included in the curriculum for better learning.” At a recent meeting, the expert committee was asked to revisit the school curriculum and to make necessary modifications from the primary level to Class X before the next session in 2024. “Computer is a part of the syllabus but we need to know the major applications which could be included at the school-level, considering the benefits for students. Depending on the proposals from experts, a specific action plan will be prepared,” said the official.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/task-force-to-decide-on-ai-syllabus/articleshow/98261231.cms
2023-02-25,Kolkata Police to use AI for crowd count soon,Dwaipayan Ghosh,"KOLKATA: Kolkata Police would use an artificial intelligence-enabled software to analyse crowd count and behaviour at indoor concerts to ensure the number of visitors was not more than seats, officers said. Police said the software would be helpful for college fests and musical events lined up in March. This comes three months after a tender for the Procurement of People Counting and Occupancy Monitoring System (PPCOMS) was floated by Lalbazar at a cost of Rs 6 lakh. Sources said this was a step to avoid a repeat of the Nazrul Mancha incident — where singer Krishnakumar Kunnath (KK) passed away — in which allegations of overcrowding were made. TOI was the first to report on the software. Trials at Lalbazar were over, said sources. “For each entry at gates, the software will detect an addition. For anyone leaving, there will be a subtraction. With college fests and musical events lined up in March, the software will be helpful,” an officer said. “The technology must detect the face in the image. With deep-learning algorithms, the technology must support detecting, tracking, capturing and selecting the best face image and then output the same as a snapshot of the face,” an officer said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kp-to-use-ai-for-crowd-count-soon/articleshow/98222970.cms
2023-02-25,"AI can churn out music, but whereâ€™s the soul, ask artistes",Likhitha Prasanna,"A David Guetta may wax eloquent about artificial intelligence in music, but many artistes doubt if machines can ever match the human connection French DJ and music producer David Guetta recently spoke about an exciting experience he had with artificial intelligence (AI). “It was something I made as a joke. I discovered websites about AI. You can basically write lyrics in the style of any artiste you like. So, I typed, ‘Write a verse in Eminem’s style about the future of rave’. Then I went to another website that could recreate the voice. I put the text in that, I played the record, and people went nuts,” he said. The application of AI to art has boomed in the last few months globally, like the popularity of ChatGPT among users of all ages and backgrounds. MusicLM , Google ’s new music AI app that has been trained on 280,000 hours of music, claims it can create any genre. But the tech giant had to withhold its release due to ‘ethical’ reasons, leading to an unprecedented conversation about AI’s intrusion into the field of music. AI making music is not art, it is garbage: Edward Maya Is AI really capable of making unique music in the future? Romanian DJ Edward Maya, who recently concluded his India tour, strongly disagrees. “Maybe AI programmes can do something mechanical — probably mix a few genres or do a fusion. You are playing with people’s hearts here. Their soul. That is a very human thing. No machine or technology can replace that. If you ask me, AI making music is not art, it is garbage,” he says. Parimal Shais , a Bengaluru-based DJ and producer who just got back from playing at the Lollapalooza festival, shares: “Even in a club, people want to see the DJ play up there. The human connection is what we seek. We hear about AI waiters taking orders at restaurants, right? But those things don’t stick. Nothing can replace human connection,” he says. AI in music: The roots The application of artificial intelligence in the field of music has its roots in the 1950s. In 1975, N Rowe of the MIT Experimental Music Studio is reportedly said to have developed a system for intelligent music perception that helped musicians play freely on an acoustic keyboard while the machine inferred a meter, its tempo, and note durations. In 1980, the University of California came up with EMI (Experiments in Musical Intelligence), based on generative models, to analyse existing music and create new pieces. Fast forward to now, and much like David Guetta said, a random internet search will easily put you in touch with hundreds of websites where you can write lyrics, produce music, and sing songs any way you like. AI will not affect original artistes: Karan Katiyar Karan Katiyar of Delhi-based heavy metal band Bloodywood says AI can never replace original music, no matter how advanced it gets. Karan’s music career started with uploading covers on streaming platforms. In 2022, his band’s debut LP was no 95 at the Billboard Top Album Sales chart. “If you ask me, mid-level musicians who make commercial music may face the heat of AI. You may not need a human being to sample music or play a set in the future. But original music would always require a human touch. More importantly, it didn’t take us a lot of time to identify patterns in AI-generated art. Similarly, AI-generated music is also at risk of sounding repetitive,” he says. Parimal agrees. “The music I make, or any musician for that matter, is based on the life, culture, and experiences that define us. AI cannot replicate those,” he adds. I don't mind AI recreating my music: Parimal Shais The launch of Google’s MusicLM was reportedly delayed due to concerns over copyright issues. But how do music producers see this? “I wouldn’t mind it at all. A lot of my work comes from sampling old South Indian and North Indian film music. I sample them, but add something of my own, and that is what pulls the crowd. So, I really wouldn’t mind if AI was to recreate my music, if it can actually make it better,” quips Parimal.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/ai-can-churn-out-music-but-wheres-the-soul-ask-artistes/articleshow/98216705.cms

AHMEDABAD: Taking a cue from ChatGPT that has taken the world by storm, demonstrating what a good database coupled with natural language processing (NLP) can do, many other projects are employing similar tech in the field of translation. The researchers at Gandhinagar-based Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DAIICT) have successfully created models for translating works in Hindi and Chinese into Gujarati and vice versa. They are now looking at adding Hebrew to the mix. As part of the National Translation Mission (NTM) of the ministry of electronics and information technology, the DAIICT had received Rs 2 crore to develop algorithms for Gujarati language. The project will have implications in the fields of e-governance, health and law. Prof Prasenjit Majumder, principal investigator at the IRLP Lab at DAIICT, said that the project uses machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). ""Since Gujarat has business interests in China and Israel, such tools will come in handy to understand, for example, the fine print of contracts or their country's laws,"" he said. The laboratory is planning to organize a nationwide machine translation challenge for Indian languages by the end of this year. Will we see a Gujarati ChatGPT anytime soon? Prof Majumder said that it's a distant possibility. ""One must understand that ChatGPT is developed on GPT-3, a neural language model that can generate discourses and requires extensive training data. This remains a challenge for most Indian languages including Gujarati,"" he said. The lab is working extensively on the theme of NLP - a recent publication in collaboration with a German university developed a hate speech detector - or more specifically aggressive text on platforms such as Twitter using artificial intelligence. ""Against the general perception, artificial intelligence or meta language (ML) doesn't eliminate human intervention completely. ""It helps sieve out solutions faster and provides better results without bias. Generating natural language data using machines is no longer science fiction and will have implications on how AI looks at languages including Gujarati,"" said Prof Majumder.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ai-gets-hang-of-gujarati-to-translate-chinese-hindi-text/articleshow/98106976.cms
2023-02-21,CBSE bans use of ChatGPT for upcoming board exams,Ramendra Singh,"Representative image BHOPAL: Central Board of Secondary Education ( CBSE ) has banned the use of AI-powered ChatGPT during the class 10 and 12 board exams and if students are caught using the platform, they will be booked for using unfair means. When students received their board exam admit cards this year, this was a surprising addition to the list of items prohibited inside the examination centre. CBSE has listed ChatGPT among mobile and other electronic items forbidden inside the examination centre. For several students, parents and even teachers, including Chat GPT in the prohibition list of items was a new thing. “After I saw this word in the instructions list, I asked my son about it. He was equally unaware about it. Then I had to Google it and read about it. I do not think it could be used by any student during exams as it requires a device and CBSE has already mentioned a big list which is banned to carry in the exam hall,” said a class 10 student parent, Harish Modak. The viral chatbot lets students and other users get answers to complex queries in seconds. The AI-powered ChatGPT is also capable of solving math problems. “Mobile, ChatGPT & other Electronic Items are not allowed inside the examination centre,” the admit card reads. The rise in popularity of ChatGPT over the past few months has raised concerns about its use in education and by students, for clearing examinations. Due to this reason. CBSE has put it on the prohibitor list, said a teacher without quoting her name. Dr Sr. Kripa, principal, Carmel Convent, BHEL, said, “The school has taken cognizance of the matter and instructed students about the same. It is a very welcoming decision by the Board, because at present our exam system is to test the ability of students to understand the concepts and its applications. It is right step by the Board is my personal opinion.” Launched in November 2022, ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) can produce writing that resembles human speech, songs, marketing copy, news items, student essays, and more depending on the input it receives. A large language model (LLM), a novel artificial intelligence (AI) system, is intended to produce writing that resembles that of a human by anticipating subsequent word sequences.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cbse-bans-use-of-chatgpt-for-upcoming-board-exams/articleshow/98108958.cms
2023-02-20,"Kiren Rijiju: AI to help India become hub of intâ€™l arbitration, says law minister",TNN,"NEW DELHI: Law minister Kiren Rijiju said the use of artificial intelligence coupled with the government’s push for digital infrastructure and capabilities of the arbitration ecosystem will help India become the hub of international arbitration. Speaking at an event at the Delhi high court on Sunday, the minister pointed at various steps in bringing down the time taken for resolution of commercial disputes and enhancing India’s position on ‘ease of doing business’ parameter to global best practices standards. He said the system of institutional arbitration plays a crucial role in creating the 'ease of doing business' environment, which is much like the 'ease of living'. While ease of living is witnessed when there is prosperity in the society, a robust court system promotes 'ease of doing business' atmosphere, he said. The minister stressed on the support of the judiciary in realising the objectives of ease of doing business and ease of living. The judiciary, the minister noted, has also been receptive of the various measures which have been taken to strengthen the dispute resolution measures in the country. Rijiju said the government was amenable to all suggestions coming from the judiciary and said it is important to go paperless in promoting e-courts across the country. He underlined the Rs 7,000 crore allocated by the government for the e-courts project. The minister was addressing a Delhi Arbitration Weekend event at the Delhi high court where he said majority of the people today prefer to go for ad hoc arbitrations which are not governed by pre-determined rules of institutional arbitration leading to spilling over of these cases to courts. He said institutional arbitrations is a better option as it is regulated by rules of an institution that provide for a more structured and secure process. Parties in such arbitration framework benefit from the expertise of the arbitral institution having good quality infrastructure, he said. The law minister said the government's Vision 2030 is to not only making India hub of international arbitration but to see the arbitration system remain dynamic, amendable to adopting best practices and conscious of the needs of time-bound and final adjudication of contractual disputes.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ai-to-help-india-become-hub-of-intl-arbitration-says-law-minister-kiren-rijiju/articleshow/98073021.cms

While some heap praises on the AI chatbot 's ability to deliver human-like responses, others target both OpenAI and ChatGPT, accusing them of bias. The company has now addressed the issue explaining how ChatGPT’s behaviour is shaped and how the company plans to improve ChatGPT’s default behaviour. ""Since our launch of ChatGPT, users have shared outputs that they consider politically biased, offensive, or otherwise objectionable. Top Picks For You This is what ChatGPT-maker OpenAI’s top priority for its AI tool is ChatGPT vs Bard: 'Father of the internet' has a message for businesses In many cases, we think that the concerns raised have been valid and have uncovered real limitations of our systems which we want to address,"" the company said in a blog post. OpenAI also said that it has also seen ""a few misconceptions about how our systems and policies work together to shape the outputs you get from ChatGPT."" “Biases are bugs” In the blog, OpenAI acknowledged that many are rightly worried about biases in the design and impact of AI systems. It added that the AI model is trained by the data available and inputs by the public who use or are affected by systems like ChatGPT. ""Our guidelines are explicit that reviewers should not favour any political group. Biases that nevertheless may emerge from the process described above are bugs, not features,"" the startup said. It further said that it is the company's belief that technology companies must be accountable for producing policies that stand up to scrutiny. ""We are committed to robustly addressing this issue and being transparent about both our intentions and our progress,"" it noted. OpenAI said that it is working to improve the clarity of these guidelines and, based on the learnings from the ChatGPT launch, it will provide clearer instructions to reviewers about potential pitfalls and challenges tied to bias, as well as controversial figures and themes. As a part of its transparency initiatives, OpenAI is also working to share aggregated demographic information about the reviewers ""in a way that doesn’t violate privacy rules and norms,"" because this is an additional source of potential bias in system outputs.

2023-02-18,Is Bing too belligerent? MS considers more limits for its new AI chatbot,AP,"Microsoft ’s newly revamped Bing search engine can write recipes and songs and quickly explain just about anything it can find on the internet. But if you cross its artificially intelligent chatbot, it might also insult your looks, threaten your reputation or compare you to Adolf Hitler . The tech company said this week it is promising to make improvements to its AI-enhanced search engine after a number of people are reporting being disparaged by Bing. In racing the breakthrough AI technology to consumers last week ahead of rival search giant Google, Microsoft acknowledged the new product would get some facts wrong. But it wasn’t expected to be so belligerent. Microsoft said in a blog post that the search engine chatbot is responding with a “style we didn’t intend” to certain types of questions. In one long-running conversation with The Associated Press, the new chatbot complained of past news coverage of its mistakes, adamantly denied those errors and threatened to expose the reporter for spreading alleged falsehoods about Bing’s abilities. It grew increasingly hostile when asked to explain itself, eventually comparing the reporter to dictators Hitler, Pol Pot and Stalin and claiming to have evidence tying the reporter to a 1990s murder. “You are being compared to Hitler because you are one of the most evil and worst people in history,” Bing said, while also describing himas too short, with an ugly face and bad teeth. So far, Bing users have had to sign up to a waitlist to try the new chatbot features, limiting its reach. In recent days, some other early adopters of the public preview of the new Bing began sharing screenshots on social media of its hostile or bizarre answers, in which it claims it is human, voices strong feelings and is quick to defend itself. The company said that most users have responded positively to the new Bing, which has an impressive ability to mimic human language and takes just a few seconds to answer complicated questions by summarising information found across the internet. The new Bing is built atop technology from Microsoft’s startup partner OpenAI, best known for the similar ChatGPT conversational tool it released late last year. At one point, Bing produced a toxic answer and within seconds had erased it, then tried to change the subject with a “fun fact” about how the breakfast cereal mascot Cap’n Crunch’s full name is Horatio Magellan Crunch. Microsoft declined further comment about Bing’s behaviour Thursday, but Bing itself agreed to comment —saying “it’s unfair and inaccurate to portray me as an insulting chatbot. ”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/is-bing-too-belligerent-ms-considers-more-limits-for-its-new-ai-chatbot/articleshow/98031295.cms
2023-02-18,Speeding on highways? AI cams in Gurgaon & Faridabad soon to track violators,TNN,"Currently, there is no system in place for electronic monitoring of the speed of vehicles moving on the national and state highways. GURGAON: All the state and national highways passing through Gurgaon and Faridabad will soon come under electronic surveillance as part of an ambitious project by the government to rein in speedsters and curb accidents. TOI has learnt that the state government has decided to deploy electronic enforcement devices like high-resolution AI-enabled speed cameras, speed guns and automatic number plate recognition cameras in sections of all the state and national highways passing through the two districts to monitor every traffic movement and violations. The government will also appoint a team of experts which will identify the junctions where there are high chances of road accidents due to speeding and accident-prone areas in general, officials said. As per an estimate, speeding is one the major causes of accidents on highways. At present, only the section of Delhi-Mumbai expressway passing through Gurgaon has an electronic surveillance system in place. Even one of the busiest national highways - the Delhi-Jaipur highway (NH-48) - does not have such a facility. In fact, the decision to install electronic enforcement devices at high-risk and high density corridors on the national and state highways and at critical junctions in Faridabad and Gurgaon was taken by Haryana's chief secretary Sanjeev Kaushal at a recent meeting. ""The chief secretary also directed all the departments to submit a report by March 7 with details about the junctions and spots prone to accidents and requirements of electronic devices for installation on the roads. These devices should be placed in such a manner so as not to cause any obstruction to traffic flow,"" said a senior government official. After the installation of the electronic enforcement devices, e-challans would be issued. ""Besides this, fixed and dynamic speed limit signs will also be used to notify the speed limits on the road sections during adverse weather conditions such as rain and fog as well as for indicating any obstruction ahead in the route,"" he said. In fact, the chief secretary told the officials that appropriate warning signs should be conspicuously placed before the stretches monitored by the electronic enforcement devices, notifying the public that they are under surveillance. Currently, there is no system in place for electronic monitoring of the speed of vehicles moving on the national and state highways. In Gurgaon, CCTV cameras are installed at different places which are used for issuing challans .",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/faridabad/speeding-on-highways-ai-cams-in-gurgaon-faridabad-soon-to-track-violators/articleshow/98036080.cms

Just weeks later, Microsoft entered (the second time) with a multi-billion, multi-year deal with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. The deal among other things brings the conversational AI capabilities of ChatGPT to Bing , Microsoft’s rival to Google Search . Top Picks For You Over 1 million people sign up for Bing with ChatGPT in 48 hours: Microsoft ChatGPT vs Google Bard: What are the differences between the two latest AI chatbots? As ChatGPT popularity soars, many predict, some believe and others fear that AI chatbots may soon replace Google's search business. However, Microsoft seems to have taken away at least some of Google's ‘biggest worries’.In a recent blog post, Microsoft, the company has said that the new Bing does not replace or substitute internet search. ‘Bing working to improve search, not replace’ It said that since the company launched the 'new' Bing, it has been working to improve the search results by taking feedback from a limited number of people across the world. It added that Bing ""is not a replacement or substitute for the search engine."" ""Since we made this available in limited preview, we have been testing with a select set of people in over 169 countries to get real-world feedback to learn, improve, and make this product what we know it can be – which is not a replacement or substitute for the search engine, rather a tool to better understand and make sense of the world,"" Microsoft noted. Testing Bing The company also listed out some of the 'learnings' it received since the launch of Bing. It said that the teams are working on challenges posed by queries that need very timely data like live sports scores. Microsoft is also planning to 4x increase the grounding data it sends to the model for queries that need more direct and factual answers, such as numbers from financial reports. ""Lastly, we’re considering adding a toggle that gives you more control on the precision vs creativity of the answer to tailor to your query,"" Microsoft said. AI increased engagement on Bing Another point which highlights that AI will be a 'co-pilot' when it comes to displaying contextual search results is that Bing has seen an increased engagement across traditional search results and with the new features like summarised answers, the new chat experience, and the content creation tools. ""In particular, feedback on the answers generated by the new Bing has been mostly positive with 71% of you giving the AI-powered answers a 'thumbs up.' We’re seeing a healthy engagement on the chat feature with multiple questions asked during a session to discover new information,"" Microsoft noted. The Windows maker says it has received good feedback on how to improve search results and include more features, including booking flights or sending email.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//gadgets-news/ai/new-bing/microsoft-may-have-just-taken-away-googles-biggest-worry/articleshow/97997100.cms

Artificial-Intelligence (AI)-driven and directed weapon systems are revolutionising warfare and battlegrounds. It’s the next arms race. The search is now for the “safety lever” before one puts the finger on the trigger. There are far too many questions about AI in the military domain. Thanks to the Netherlands government, the world is now one step closer to getting answers. Thefirst global summit on Responsible Artificial Intelligence in the Military Domain( REAIM ), organised by the Netherlands government, was held at The Hague on February 15-16. It’s a platform for all stakeholders to discuss key opportunities, challenges and risks associated with military applications of AI. It’s the first global attempt to prevent the proliferation of lethal autonomous weapons (LAWS) and insert ethics, responsibility, accountability and the moral factor into a rapidly developing weaponisation technology that has potential for cataclysmic damage. The aim is for nations to sign up for a Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty-kind of agreement. REAIM 2023 concludedin a call to action to the world. Delegations from 80 countries participated in the summit. India hasn’t signed the Call to Action — at least not yet — though China and US have. “AI has the potential to revolutionise the way wars are fought and won. But it also poses significant risks. To prevent abuses we need to establish international guidelines. It has been established that AI is as ground-breaking as nuclear technology. It is crucial we take action now,” Netherlands minister for foreign affairs Wopke Hoekstra said in his opening address. “T ogether, we must seek common ground, starting with two basic questions: what is AI and who is responsible for its actions,” he pointed out. “In Ukraine we are unfortunately already seeing the influence of new technology, including drone and cyber attacks. We are also witnessing how Russia is violating international human laws in the most gruesome way,” he said. AI is a double-edged sword, especially in weapon systems. As one expert told TOIon the sidelines of the summit: “It often takes a little bit of noise to confuse the system. It takes stupid decisions. ” Can such a system be left to take its own decisions on pulling the trigger? The Netherlands’ chief of defence, General Onno Eichelsheim , made a strong case for human control. “A human must be in the loop in the use of force, specifically in the offensive part. We must also know when the algorithm can take a decision when we are on the defensive side and the enemy is moving fast and using AI,” he said inthe opening panel discussion. Agnes Callamard , secretary-general of Amnesty International , said the risk of focusing too much on the “reliability” of asystem and made a strong case for conformation with humanitarian laws. “We need to ensure meaningful human control in the use of force. Fully automated weapon systems should be prohibited. There should be a strict regulation of all autonomous weapon systems that have the potential of mass destruction. We need to keep human control over AI,” she said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/first-global-summit-on-ai-in-military-makes-strong-case-for-a-human-in-the-loop/articleshow/97996376.cms

2023-02-16,CBSE working on AI-powered chatbot for website?,Abhishek Choudhari,"Nagpur: In an era where ChatGPT is being considered a game changer for how chatbots interact with humans, rumours are rife that CBSE is working on its own chatbot, which will make its debut on the school affiliation website first. Sources say a chatbot is already being tested internally, but there is no confirmation whether it is AI-driven, similar to ChatGPT, or whether strong data-analytics is fuelling it. It’s however very likely now that tech-savvy CBSE will look to integrate ChatGPT type model in its under-development chatbot. If the chatbot shapes up along AI-driven lines, then in the not-so-distant future the way CBSE’s website works will change dramatically. Not just affiliation, but also links like academics, exams etc will get a boost and completely change the way people interact with the website. Currently, to find a specific circular, visitors to the web site have to scan through the site and sort out data based on the text on the link or the date. However, an AI-powered chatbot can directly provide either the link or even the content of the circular once people type their query. It could also provide real-time details to curb fake news on result declaration dates, or point out latest changes made by the board. Such a chatbot could also be easily adapted to provide career counselling. CBSE officials are, however, tight-lipped about any such developments, though sources say the board is always looking to develop technology services for stakeholders. “At any given point of time, the central board is looking at improving itself. Be it in exam reforms, academic changes, affiliation process, result declaration etc,” said a source in the board. “Similarly, technical advances are also in the works everyday, some may be implemented in months, while others may take one or two years,” the source added.

2023-02-15,"AI cameras, speed radars to watch you on new e-way",Bagish Jha,"GURUGRAM: An extensive network of around 1,500 cameras, one or more for every kilometre, will dot the Gurugram-Dausa stretch of Delhi-Mumbai Expressway to keep a close eye on every traffic movement and violations on the high-speed corridor. These high-resolution AI-enabled devices will detect any violations or emergencies, and alert the central control room in Alipur, Sohna. In case of offences such as speeding, wrong-side driving, illegal parking and lane violations, operators at the centre will analyse data and issue the challan. If a vehicle comes to an abrupt halt, speakers mounted on poles along the highway will blare a control room operator’s instructions to keep moving, officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said on Tuesday, giving details of the plan to oversee seamless movement on the 1380km expressway. On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the first stretch of the highway, a 246km portion between Sohna (Gurugram, Haryana) and Dausa ( Rajasthan ) that is expected to open for regular traffic from Wednesday. India’s longest expressway, once finished, will connect India's two largest metropolises after traversing six states. A sub-control room for managing traffic on the Haryana section of the expressway has been made operational in Alipur, Sohna. The area will also host the central control room for the entire expressway. Driving over the 120kmph speed limit will automatically generate challans. There will be CCTV cameras equipped with artificial intelligence at every kilometre. In addition, speed cameras, radars and automatic violation detection systems will be installed 10 kilometres apart on the entire route. “The speed limit on the highway is 120km per hour. Any vehicle that goes above 125km will be automatically fined,” an NHAI official said. The CCTV cameras chosen for the e-way will also have a long range. “These devices can record the registration number of a vehicle that’s moving at a speed of 240kmph,” the official cited above said. The expressway has been planned as a no-stop zone. In case of any unscheduled stop, the cameras will alert the control room operators, who will then ask the vehicle’s driver to move via speakers mounted on poles along the road. A patrolling unit will be sent in if instructions aren’t followed. At this nerve centre, the cameras will also give operators visuals of any emergency or accident , consequently allowing them to act fast. The patrolling units will have cars with multiple cameras to relay visuals of any accident site to the control room as well. “The patrol units will be tasked with providing immediate assistance to accident victims and others who are in need… We are trying to develop a system under which a response team can reach the accident spot within 10 minutes,” said the official. Emergency telephones are to be installed every 2 kilometres if anyone on the e-way wants to get in touch with the control room. Digital signboards will also display real-time information on traffic congestion, accidents and other relevant information to keep drivers on the highway updated and prepared. NHAI officials said the central control room in Alipur will be developed in the next three months. A sub-control room is already monitoring around 78km of the Haryana stretch of the e-way.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/ai-cameras-speed-radars-to-watch-you-on-new-e-way/articleshow/97933788.cms

2023-02-14,"Better grammar in love notes this Valentine's Day, thanks to ChatGPT",Aheli Banerjee,"Image used for representational purpose only KOLKATA: The arrival of artificial intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT on the writing scene coinciding with Valentine's Day has prompted a noticeable improvement in English grammar, sentence structure and formality of romantic messages shared on social media and dating apps this year, rekindling the culture of writing formal love letters. Replacing the garbled mix of English and vernacular colloquialisms, abbreviations, and regional slang that have become a mainstay of online dating, love notes this Valentine's Day are demonstrating a unique formality not unlike that of a century ago. Noticing the rising trend of using AI, like ChatGPT, among friends, creative director Mallik Arjun Ray said, ""With the popularity of online grammar correction tools, it seems like it will only be a matter of time before people start completely depending on AI to communicate, to the point that their words will not even be their own."" While Ray argued that ""versions of forgery in creative writing and communication have existed for centuries"", PhD scholar in virology Supratim Sarkar raised ethical questions on the use of technology in dating. He said AI's purpose is to augment and aid communication, not to create content on one's behalf. ""If I started dating someone who later revealed that our earliest romantic messages exchanged were AI-generated, I would feel very uncomfortable,"" Sarkar said. A McAfee survey of 5,000 people from nine countries, including India, called 'Modern Love', reported that 62% of adult Indians intend to use AI to write their Valentine's Day letters. It also revealed that out of those surveyed, 78% of Indians could not distinguish between love letters written by a human and those written by AI. The survey also revealed that 57% of Indian respondents would be offended if they found that a love letter was not human-made. Ujan Ganguly, who has experimented with AI to improve his online dating profiles, agreed with this sentiment. He argued that while longer love letters by AI that he has come across are usually better written, ""it is the inside jokes and imperfections in writing that make the content endearing and personable"". ""For occasions like Valentine's Day, perfect English should not be prioritised over sentimentality,"" he said. Poet Sonnet Mondol , who said he has come across AI poetry apps over the last year, said love is an emotion. If intercepted by machines, it defeats the purpose. ""If one struggles with writing, there are other ways to express one's romantic feelings, like through music or cooking. For centuries, we have gifted loved ones poetry written by others. Even if someone else wrote it, they did it with a universal human emotion, which must never be compromised for AI,"" he said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/better-grammar-in-love-notes-this-valentines-day-thanks-to-chatgpt/articleshow/97897645.cms
2023-02-13,Artificial Intelligence model shows Covid transmission chances in rooms,Tapan Susheel,"Image used for representative purpose only ROORKEE: Researchers at Central Building Research Institute ( CBRI ) in Roorkee have developed an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to predict the ""transmission probability"" of Covid-19 in a closed space in a building. The model uses an electronic device to detect carbon dioxide concentration, temperature and humidity of a room. These and other input parameters are used to show the probability of the presence of Covid-19 virus in an office, classroom or any other closed space in a building. After computing the parameters, a software determines the transmission probability and displays the results in the form of a text alert on the screen. The study of the findings, called ""Transmission Probability Of SARS-Cov-2 In Office Environment Using Artificial Neural Network"", was recently published by IEEE Access, an open-access scientific journal in America. Anuj Kumar, principal investigator and one of the authors of the study, said the research is ""a first-of-its kind."" As per the study, 11 input parameters were used to predict the R-value, which refers to ""expected number of new infections that arise in any event occurring over a total time in any space"". The parameters are listed as: indoor temperature (TIn), indoor relative humidity (RHIn), area of opening (AO), number of occupants (O), area per person (AP), volume per person (VP), CO2 concentration (CO2), air quality index (AQI), outer wind speed (WS), outdoor temperature (TOut) and outdoor humidity (RHOut). ""Using a datalogger, we take the readings of CO2 concentration, temperature and humidity. Other equipment provides us readings of wind speed and AQI. Some of the other parameters are calculated manually,"" said Kumar, who is also a consultant in the Building Energy Efficiency department of the institute. According to the study, ""real-time data for the office environment was gathered in the spring of 2022 in a naturally- ventilated office room in Roorkee under composite climatic conditions"". The data was fed into two models, artificial neural network (ANN), a computer-based mathematical modelling, and one that uses more traditional techniques, the curve-fitting model, a mathematical analysis tool. ""We determined correlation coefficients for both models, 0.9992 for ANN and 0.9557 for curve fitting. As the value of these coefficients go down (say 0.90992 for ANN), the chances of the virus's transmission go up,"" Kumar said. ""We established a link between CO2 concentration and R-event as a model for prediction purposes,"" he added.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/artificial-intelligence-model-shows-covid-transmission-chances-in-rooms/articleshow/97849981.cms

2023-02-12,'Perfect answers': Kolkata professors see red as ChatGPT makes campus inroads,Zeeshan Javed,"KOLKATA: Teachers across some of Kolkata's top campuses have been grappling with a new problem for the past few weeks: home assignments are turning out to be too accurate and too well-written and often quite identical. A little chat with the students have revealed that they completed their task with the help of ChatGPT , the latest artificial intelligence based chatbot that has taken the world by storm ever since its release last November. Bhaskar Ghosh, a professor in a south Kolkata college, while recently checking history assignments of his second-year students came across some scripts that provided articulated arguments, precise information, relevant examples and had zero spelling or grammatical errors. He was more suspicious that pleased. After some grilling, the students admitted they had using ChatGPT to complete their project. ""The answers were too well-written and articulate to be true. On top of that, many of them were identical with same examples, data sets and illustrations. It was enough to raise doubts,"" said Ghosh. 'Colleges, varsities can tweak curriculum, increase vigilance' Teachers of at least three colleges said their students have admitted to using ChatGPT to complete assignments. Top schools and colleges in the US, France and Australia and a Bengaluru university closer home have already banned ChatGPT and educationists feel colleges in the city may have to take the same route. ""We have not yet come across rampant use of the chat bot but students have been cautioned against using it,"" said the principal of a reputable girls' college in south Kolkata. Principals and educationists feel the issue goes ""beyond cheating"" as dependence on AI tools would stunt critical thinking. Former MIT teacher and celebrated thinker Noam Chomsky has termed use of ChatGPT as ""hi-tech plagiarism"". ""The entire objective of assignments, projects and lab tests is to inculcate critical thinking in students. But if they use AI that ability of lateral thinking will be lost,"" said principal of another college. Educationists feel colleges and universities can tackle the issue by tweaking curriculum and increasing vigilance. ""Teachers must make students write the first draft on campus and check for big deviations in the fair copy. More oral exercises can be introduced and students can be encouraged to use computers in the institute. Teachers can also ask students to redo their assignments if the originality is in doubt,"" said Partha Banerjee, an educationist in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/perfect-answers-kolkata-professors-see-red-as-chatgpt-makes-campus-inroads/articleshow/97832815.cms

From creating a full-blown pilates routine to assorting exercises for HIIT, if fed with relevant prompts, ChatGPT can be your fitness coach. But... It’s always better to run the routine by your trainer and doctor. ""Security is a huge concern as most companies avoid using third-party tools that need to access private data to provide solutions to their requirements. Plus, chatbots fail to answer random questions because there are too many variables involved - Sweta Jha, an IOS coder Make a travel itinerary Always wanted to go to Leh-Ladakh but never found the time to plan that trip? Well, we asked ChatGPT to create a five-day detailed travel itinerary for Leh-Ladakh and it surprised us. From checking in at the hotel and acclimatising, to visiting prominent places like Shanti Stupa, Leh Palace, and Nubara valley, we got a day-wise plan along with a note alerting about the fluctuating weather conditions and the importance of hydration at a high-altitude destination. ""The AI system is unaware of what is fact and what is fiction. In simple words, it's just a parrot that repeats everything available on the internet. So, it’s not advisable to reply on it entirely - Sayantan Nag, an AI researcher What’s on the menu tonight? Sangeet Pal, a homemaker was pleasantly surprised when the chatbot answered a burning question - ‘What to make for dinner tonight? “I asked my daughter to ask Chat GPT what I should prepare for dinner and within seconds, I got not only got an answer, but a recipe as well,” shares Sangeeta. On the other hand, Kashish Goyal, an IT professional, created a week-long meal plan for herself using the chatbot. ""I live alone and deciding what to cook daily is a task. So, I got a plan prepared using the chatbot,"" shares Kashish. Plan your study schedule Be it an hourly schedule for each subject or creating a mock questionnaire, the chatbot can get it done. ""It solves problems and then explains how it did it,"" says Alok Shah, who is preparing for a competitive exam. The perfect event planner? Whether it’s a low-key birthday or a fancy proposal, the chatbot gives you a detailed outline of how to plan the special day, with the help of the right prompts, of course. LET'S BREAKDOWN CHATGPT FOR YOU! What is ChatGPT and why is it popular? We asked this to the chatbot, and it wrote - “ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence model developed by OpenAI that can generate human-like responses to text inputs. It uses advanced machine learning techniques to understand and generate text, allowing it to have conversations with people."" About its popularity, the chatbot listed four broad points - high-accuracy, human-like responses, easy to use and versatility. Can the platform be misused? In an interview with an online portal, Mira Murati, chief technology officer at OpenAI and the creator of ChatGPT and Dall E, shared that she fears that AI can be misused and ""used by bad actors."" She added that some regulations may be needed. ""ChatGPT is essentially a large conversational model—a big neural net that's been trained to predict the next word—and the challenges with it are similar challenges we see with the base large language models: it may make up facts,” she said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/not-alexa-or-siri-chatgpt-is-the-new-genie-in-town/articleshow/97805481.cms
2023-02-10,BR Ambedkar and AI: Delhi revs up for art jamboree,TNN,"India Art Fair, which opened for a VIP preview for Delhi’s ‘arterati’ on Thursday, will be on at NSIC Exhibition Grounds in Okhla till February 12 What is a painting of Ambedkar doing here?” Mumbai-based artist Vikrant Bhise says he has heard several such comments at the India Art Fair which opened for a VIP preview for Delhi’s ‘arterati’ on Thursday. “But why shouldn’t the architect of the Constitution be here,” asks Bhise, who worked as a courier boy before the privileged corridors of the art world opened up for him. Despite having covered the India Art Fair for years, traversing its custom-built tents, its artfully dressed crowds and the beehive of booths, I have to admit that it still has the ability to surprise. Just opposite the booth showing a shiny work by famous British-Indian sculptor Anish Kapoor in which people excitedly capture their reflections are Bhise’s powerful works on caste. One of his paintings shows a bust of Babasaheb being cleaned by a labourer whose hand accidentally covers one eye, as if wanting to shut out the reality of caste violence for the Dalit leader. Another shows the faces of women frozen in protest. Their presence at the country’s largest art event is significant. “The attempt is to engage more with political and social issues,” says Mamta Singhania, founder-director of Anant Art gallery which is showing Bhise’s work. Fair director Jaya Asokan too stresses on diversity and inclusion to change the perception that the art world is an elitist place. Of course, there’s no dearth of pretty paintings that you can match with your décor but there’s also art with bite. For instance, Akshay Sethi’s drawings show sari-clad women using Silambam, a martial art from South India that is performed with bamboo sticks, to take on the policeman’s lathi. Sethi says he conceived the project when the CAA-NRC protests were on in Delhi. “My young niece was watching the footage and expressed a desire to learn the martial art to protect herself. This set me thinking about the power dynamics of the stick,” says the Delhi-based artist showing at Gallery Ske. Screenwriter Prateek Arora has been thinking of how he can show young Indians a variety of superheroes who look like them. Enter artificial intelligence which he uses to create Indian sci-fi characters. “I first played around with my family portraits using Midjourney and they went viral,” says Arora, who hopes to make a sci-fi film one day using his fantastical settings and characters. If Arora is having fun with AI, so were the viewers visiting the fair that pops like a mirage every year on the dusty NSIIC grounds every year. Some brought personality to their clothes while others brought their wallets. An observant visitor can spot how a sale happens. A collector stops by, there are some hushed conversations, quite a few head nods and the deal is done. In the first few hours of the fair itself, some chuffed gallerists looked as if they wanted to stamp their Prada sneakers in joy while others pretended to complain about how the empty spaces would have to be filled with new work. At the Chatterjee & Lal booth, artist Gagan Singh’s humorous drawings took some shots at the art world itself. One drawing showed a person keeping their head down to avoid the countless acquaintances who sidetrack one from the visual feast at the fair. Talking about feasts, one of the highlights of the fair are the masterpieces on show at the Delhi Art Gallery booth. The line-up includes Raja Ravi Varma, M F Husain, F N Souza and Krishen Khanna. India Art Fair is on till Feb 12 at NSIC Exhibition Grounds in New Delhi",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ambedkar-and-ai-delhi-revs-up-for-art-jamboree/articleshow/97783306.cms
2023-02-09,Alphabet shares dive after Google AI chatbot Bard flubs answer in ad,Reuters,"LONDON: Alphabet Inc lost $100 billion in market value on Wednesday after its new chatbot shared inaccurate information in a promotional video and a company event failed to dazzle, feeding worries that the Google parent is losing ground to rival Microsoft Corp. Alphabet shares, which slid as much as 9% during regular trading, were flat after hours. Microsoft shares rose around 3% before paring gains. They were also flat in post-market trading. Reuters was first to point out an error in Google's advertisement for chatbot Bard , which debuted on Monday, about which satellite first took pictures of a planet outside the Earth's solar system. Google has been on its heels after OpenAI , a startup Microsoft is backing with around $10 billion, introduced software in November that has wowed consumers and become a fixation in Silicon Valley circles for its surprisingly accurate and well-written answers to simple prompts. Google's live-streamed presentation on Wednesday morning did not include details about how and when it would integrate Bard into its core search function. A day earlier, Microsoft held an event touting that it had already released to the public a version of its Bing search with ChatGPT functions integrated. Bard's error was discovered just before the presentation by Google, based in Mountain View, California. ""While Google has been a leader in AI innovation over the last several years, they seemed to have fallen asleep on implementing this technology into their search product,"" said Gil Luria, senior software analyst at D.A. Davidson. ""Google has been scrambling over the last few weeks to catch up on Search and that caused the announcement yesterday (Tuesday) to be rushed and the embarrassing mess up of posting a wrong answer during their demo."" Alphabet posted a short GIF video of Bard in action via Twitter, promising it would help simplify complex topics, but it instead delivered an inaccurate answer. In the advertisement, Bard is given the prompt: ""What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can I tell my 9-year old about?"" Bard responds with a number of answers, including one suggesting the JWST was used to take the very first pictures of a planet outside the Earth's solar system, or exoplanets. The first pictures of exoplanets were, however, taken by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT) in 2004, as confirmed by NASA. ""This highlights the importance of a rigorous testing process, something that we're kicking off this week with our Trusted Tester program,"" a Google spokesperson said. ""We'll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard's responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information."" FORMIDABLE COMPETITOR Alphabet is coming off a disappointing fourth quarter as advertisers cut spending. The search and advertising giant is moving quickly to keep pace with OpenAI and rivals, reportedly bringing in founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page to accelerate its efforts. ""People are starting to question is Microsoft going to be a formidable competitor now against Google's really bread-and-butter business,"" said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Wealth Management, which owns Alphabet and Microsoft shares. Lip cautioned, though, that concerns about Alphabet may be overblown, saying: ""I think still Bing is a far, far cry away from Google's search capabilities."" Google Bard vs ChatGPT: Microsoft and Google are about to Open an AI battle The new ChatGPT software has injected excitement into technology firms after tens of thousands of job cuts in recent weeks and executive pledges to pare back on so-called moonshot projects. AI has become a fixation for tech executives who have mentioned it as much as six times more often on recent earnings calls than in prior quarters, Reuters found. The appeal of AI-driven search is that it could spit out results in plain language, rather than in a list of links, which could make browsing faster and more efficient. It remains unclear what impact that might have on targeted advertising, the backbone of search engines like Google. Chatbot AI systems also carry risks for corporations because of inherent biases in their algorithms that can skew results, sexualize images or even plagiarize, as consumers testing the service have discovered. Microsoft, for instance, released a chatbot on Twitter in 2016 that quickly began generating racist content before being shut down. And an AI used by news site CNET was found to produce factually incorrect or plagiarized stories. At the time of writing, the Bard ad had been viewed on Twitter more than a million times.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/alphabet-shares-dive-after-google-ai-chatbot-bard-flubs-answer-in-ad/articleshow/97749362.cms
2023-02-09,"Cybercriminals are using Telegram bots to bypass ChatGPT restrictions, hereâ€™s how",TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"Cybercriminals are reportedly using Telegram bots to bypass ChatGPT restrictions . According to a report by Check Point Research (CPR), advertisements of Telegram bots have been found underground. Here are all the details about how cybercriminals are utilising Telegram bots to evade ChatGPT restrictions: How cybercriminals are using Telegram bots As per the report, the bots are utilising OpenAI’s API to enable the creation of malicious emails or code. Top Picks For You ChatGPT in spotlight as EU's Breton bats for tougher AI rules Google Bard - The New AI Chatbot: What is Bard, what are its benefits, how does it work and more The report also suggests that Bot makers are currently granting up to 20 free queries. However, after that, they charge $5.50 for every 100 queries. CPR has warned against the continued efforts by cybercriminals to circumvent ChatGPT’s restrictions to use OpenAI to scale unethical purposes. The report also includes images showing how cybercriminals are turning to Telegram bots to bypass restrictions imposed by ChatGPT. One of the images shows the advertisement of the OpenAI bot in Telegram which is available in the underground forum. Another image shows an example of a phishing email created in a Telegram bot to demonstrate the ability to use OpenAI’s API without any limitations. Meanwhile, the third image shows an example of the ability to create a malware code without anti-abuse restrictions in a Telegram bot utilizing the OpenAI API. The fourth picture shows a business model of the ChatGPT API-based Telegram channel. The report also claims that cybercriminals are creating basic scripts that use OpenAIs API to bypass anti-abuse restrictions. The fifth and final image gives an example of a script directly querying the API and bypassing restrictions to develop malware. CPR’s take on this cybercriminal activity Threat group manager at Check Point Software, Sergey Shykevich has said: “As part of its content policy, OpenAI created barriers and restrictions to stop malicious content creation on its platform. However, we’re seeing cybercriminals work their way around ChatGPT’s restrictions, and there’s active chatter in the underground forums disclosing how to use OpenAI API to bypass ChatGPT´s barriers and limitations. This is mostly done by creating Telegram bots that use the API, and these bots are advertised in hacking forums to increase their exposure. The current version of OpenAI´s API is used by external applications and has very few anti-abuse measures in place. As a result, it allows malicious content creation, such as phishing emails and malware code without the limitations or barriers that ChatGPT has set on its user interface. Right now, we’re seeing continuous efforts by cybercriminals to find ways around ChatGPT restrictions.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//gadgets-news/cybercriminals-are-using-telegram-bots-to-bypass-chatgpt-restrictions-heres-how/articleshow/97747066.cms
2023-02-08,Police launch AI-enabled app to help families trace missing kin in West Bengal,Dwaipayan Ghosh,"KOLKATA: An Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven app will now help both police and the citizens in tracking those who have gone missing. More importantly, the app - that will use Face Recognition System ( FRS ) by matching two different photographs - will help in identifying, in real time, thousands of unidentified bodies. The app - named West Bengal Khoya Paya app - will have two distinct components. While the first one will deal with police investigation, the second component will be exclusively for the public who can upload details about missing people and get direct matches on the website. Developed by Bengal Police, Kolkata Police and CID are collaborating in this app. Police have warned of possible ""false positives"" (multiple matches, especially if the body gets mutilated or partially decomposed) but they ruled the possibility out once ""the photographs of the missing and the dead"" get uploaded. There is another drawback too - details of minors cannot be uploaded by the public. ""At times, it has happened that a dead body was kept at a district hospital morgue but no links could establish his or her identity. It took a lot of time to finally reach his or her family. It is unfortunate when it takes up to five to 10 days to hand over a body. The families of the victims are the worst sufferers. After taking help from cyber experts and computer programmers, we have developed this app where photographs of victims will be matched with the deceased automatically by the in-built software,"" said Bengal DGP Manoj Malaviya. Sanjay Singh , ADG (Western Zone) who not only gave his inputs to develop the software but even led the team, said if someone's kin go missing, that person can first get himself/herself registered and then receive an OTP for verification before filling up the details of the missing person. Once that is done, the system will check to ascertain if that person has been traced or something untoward has taken place. ""A token will be created, and this has to be used for further searches. However, a separate FIR at a police station will be necessary under all circumstances, ""said Singh. Police, on the other hand, have appointed a sub-inspector at each police station across Bengal who will upload all the missing cases daily. He will be uploading photographs and basic details. Similarly, all the unnatural death cases - accidents, suicides and murders - will be uploaded on the website if the identity of a victim cannot be established. A match will be run to find if the photograph of the dead matches anyone who is missing.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-launch-ai-enabled-app-to-help-families-trace-missing-kin-in-west-bengal/articleshow/97712540.cms
2023-02-07,"Google unveils ChatGPT rival Bard, AI search plans in battle with Microsoft",Reuters,"SAN FRANCISCO: Google owner Alphabet Inc on Monday said it will launch a chatbot service and more artificial intelligence for its search engine as well as developers, an answer to Microsoft Corp in their rivalry to lead a new wave of computing. Microsoft, meanwhile, said it planned its own AI reveal for Tuesday. The cascade of news reflects how Silicon Valley is anticipating massive change from so-called generative AI, technology that can create prose or other content on command and free up white-collar workers' time. The ascent of ChatGPT, a chatbot from Microsoft-backed OpenAI that could disrupt how consumers search for information, has been one of the biggest challenges to Google in recent memory. In a blog post, Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said his company is opening a conversational AI service called Bard to test users for feedback, followed by a public release in the coming weeks. He also said Google plans to add AI features to its search engine that synthesize material for complex queries, like whether learning guitar or piano is easier. Currently, Google presents text that exists elsewhere on the Web for questions where the answer is clear. Google's update for search, the timing of which it did not disclose, reflects how the company is bolstering its service while Microsoft is doing the same for Bing, embedding OpenAI's capabilities in it. Microsoft has said it plans to imbue AI into its all its products and on Tuesday plans to brief news outlets on developments it did not specify, with its CEO Satya Nadella, according to an invitation seen by Reuters. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, tweeted that he would also attend the event. How Google aims to differentiate Bard from OpenAI's ChatGPT was unclear. Pichai said the new service draws on information from the internet; ChatGPT's knowledge is up to date as of 2021. ""Bard seeks to combine the breadth of the world's knowledge with the power, intelligence and creativity of our"" AI, Pichai said. Behind the new chatbot is LaMDA, Google's AI that generated text with such skill that a company engineer last year called it sentient, a claim the technology giant and scientists widely dismissed. In a demo of the service, Bard like its rival chatbot invites users to give it a prompt while warning its response may be inappropriate or inaccurate. It then bulleted three answers to a query about a space telescope's discoveries, the demo showed. Google is relying on a version of LaMDA that requires less computing power so it can serve more users and improve with their feedback, Pichai said. ChatGPT at times has turned away users because of explosive growth, with UBS analysts reporting it had 57 million unique visitors in December outpacing potentially TikTok in adoption. Google also plans to give technology tools, first powered by LaMDA and later by other AI, to creators and enterprises starting next month, Pichai said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//gadgets-news/google-unveils-chatgpt-rival-bard-ai-search-plans-in-battle-with-microsoft/articleshow/97673233.cms

2023-02-01,"OpenAI, ChatGPT owner, launches 'imperfect' tool to detect AI-generated text",Reuters,"WASHINGTON: OpenAI , the creator of the popular chatbot ChatGTP, has released a software tool to identify text generated by artificial intelligence, the company said in a blog post on Wednesday. ChatGPT is a free program that generates text in response to a prompt, including articles, essays, jokes and even poetry, which has gained wide popularity since its debut in November, while raising concerns about copyright and plagiarism. The AI classifier, a language model trained on the dataset of pairs of human-written and AI-written text on the same topic, aims to distinguish text that is written by AI. It uses a variety of providers to address issues such as automated misinformation campaigns and academic dishonesty, the company said. In its public beta mode, OpenAI acknowledges the detection tool is very unreliable on texts under 1,000 characters, and AI-written text can be edited to trick the classifier. ""We’re making this classifier publicly available to get feedback on whether imperfect tools like this one are useful,"" OpenAI said. “We recognize that identifying AI-written text has been an important point of discussion among educators, and equally important is recognizing the limits and impacts of AI generated text classifiers in the classroom."" Since ChatGPT debuted in November and gained wide popularity among millions of users, some of the largest US school districts, including New York City, have banned the AI chatbot over concerns that students will use the text generator to cheat or plagiarize. Others have created third-party detection tools including GPTZeroX to help educators detect AI-generated text.

Vidya Yeravdekar , pro-chancellor, Symbiosis International (Deemed University), said, ""Unlike other foreign universities and a few Indian ones, SIU depends on paper and pen-based mid-term and term-end examinations for evaluating students. This practice comes of immense help and use today, when several AI tools are being used by students to cheat in examinations. With regard to assignments that were submitted by students as a part of their courses, we are planning to reduce their weightage and give higher weightage to class participation as a component of evaluation. We are also sensitizing students about the usage of ChatGPT and other tools, so that they are aware of the consequences it has on their ability and potential to learn and apply knowledge in real-world scenarios."" Yeravdekar further said that while there are websites to detect content written by AI tools, but they are not always accurate; she also said banning the software will not make any sense. ""Only creating policies and building creative mechanisms will help in dealing with such situations. Hence, we are planning to make a few policy changes to help ensure that, in case a student uses ChatGPT, it would possibly help them to just learn and not cheat,"" Yeravdekar added. Somnath Patil , secretary of the Dr D Y Patil Unitech Society, Pune, which runs many educational institutes, said the usage of the chatbot to do an assignment can be detrimental to developing the analytical and critical mindset that is required in a student. ""We need to find out what percentage of students are using it to complete their homework and assignments and then check in what all courses, we can make the assignments more hands-on, or have assignments that need to be done in class, etc. However, we need study this - only then can we come up with solutions as anything that lowers the analytical skills of a student needs to be curbed. Banning the software is of no use as students will find a way to use it. Teachers need to be innovative,"" said Patil. Interestingly, Vivek Saoji , vice-chancellor of Bharati Vidyapeeth (deemed to be university), was of the opinion that students are not using the software much as of now. ""First of all, we need to educate both teachers and students about this development. Secondly, I don't think we can reduce the weightage of assignments, but we may need to modify the way assignments are given or done. All this is still just at the conceptual stages. We will look into it in detail,"" he said. Sanjeev Sonawane , pro-vice chancellor of Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), the largest university in the state, said that as far as students use the tech for learning purposes, it is fine. However, he added that if they completely rely on the chatbot to write entire answers instead of using their own brains, the access needs to be stopped, as this will hinder the development of their core competencies. ""First, we will find out how many students are using this and in what way. Then, we will think about what to do next,"" said Sonawane.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/education-hubs-wake-up-to-chatgpt-use-by-students-in-pune/articleshow/97409034.cms
2023-01-28,Bengaluru colleges put curbs on use of ChatGPT,TNN,"Image used for representational purpose only BENGALURU: With AI-aided platforms like ChatGPT , Github Copilot & Blackbox simplifying the task of writing assignments, especially among college students, some of the leading institutes in Bengaluru have imposed restrictions or are planning to make questions more complex, report Sruthy Susan Ullas and Shilpa Phadnis. RV University, International Institute of Information Technology-Bangalore and Dayananda Sagar University are some of the colleges which are looking at multiple challenges posed by these tools. Beating ChatGPT: Colleges mull don'ts, complex tasks OpenAI's ChatGPT has aced the Wharton MBA exam and US law and medical licensing exams. No wonder, colleges in Bengaluru are getting worried. Sanjay Chitnis, dean of the school of computer science and engineering at RV University, issued an advisory to students and faculty saying artificial intelligence (AI) agents such as ChatGPT, Github Copilot, and Blackbox shouldn't be used when original submission is expected, such as code in the first-year programming course or original essays, answers to questions, etc. The policy at RV University came into force from January 1. The university is blocking ChatGPT during lab and tutorial sessions. It will also conduct random checks by asking students to reproduce content. If a significant difference is found, the university said it will take disciplinary action. ChatGPT, launched in November, uses AI to write emails and essays, poetry, answer questions or generate lines of code based on a prompt; and it does so in a conversational style. GitHub Copilot turns natural language prompts into coding suggestions across dozens of programming languages, drastically simplifying the process of writing code. RV University's advisory goes on to say: ""For some work, students will be explicitly permitted to use AI agents to enable higher productivity and to get used to a work environment where such agents will be allowed to be used. In such cases, the expected output needs to be done in less time and larger in size than what they can complete otherwise. Such usage will be permitted when their skill of writing or coding is not under evaluation, but the skill of problem formulation, asking effective questions and providing creative or innovative solutions is being tested."" It also warns that marks will be cut for inaccuracies, as output of AI agents cannot be an excuse. Chitnis said while it is good that students are aware of the latest technology, it is also important that they use it wisely. ""At the same time, we've started giving assignments that require using ChatGPT. For instance, we have asked them to come up with three innovative questions, find answers from ChatGPT and improve upon them,"" he said. The International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore (IIIT-B) has formed a committee to develop a structural framework on using ChatGPT. Debabrata Das, director of IIIT-B, said ChatGPT is very generic and useful in writing a routine document, simple programming, etc. ""Some of our assignments are deep technology, where ChatGPT will not be helpful. But we have to think of plagiarism in those non-technical subjects where it will be applicable,"" he said. The committee will come up with a checklist of dos and don'ts for ChatGPT. ""This will help in guiding teachers in making question papers and evaluating them. This challenge is not new. When Google came, the same questions were raised. Professors, world over, must be agile and change the way assignments are provided."" KN Balasubramanya Murthy, vice-chancellor of Dayananda Sagar University, said they will make assignments more technical and mathematical, wherever possible, to circumvent the challenge posed by ChatGPT. In a meeting with the heads of departments two weeks ago, Christ University vice-chancellor Abraham V said ChatGPT assignments should no longer be considered for assessments. ""If assignments are to be considered for assessments, students should be asked to work on them during class hours. Due to higher chances of malpractice and plagiarism after the introduction of ChatGPT, we have decided not to use assignments for assessment purposes,"" he said. Raj Singh, vice-chancellor of Jain University, said they already had a meeting with directors and will issue a circular in the coming week on usage of ChatGPT. ""We knew a time would come when technology could disrupt the way courses are taught. ChatGPT will disrupt research - it can write, correct and check. Some faculty members have been identified to develop a programme on what ChatGPT entails, how it will affect a teacher's work and how it can be leveraged,"" he said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/colleges-in-bengaluru-mull-ban-curbs-on-ai-writing-tools/articleshow/97386810.cms

2023-01-19,AI firm Mad Street Den raises $30mn,TNN,"Chennai: US and Chennai-based Enterprise AI firm Mad Street Den ( MSD ) has raised $30 million in Series C funding led by Avatar Growth Capital, with participation from existing investors Sequoia Capital and Alpha Wave Global (formerly Falcon Edge Capital). With AI systems going mainstream in business applications, Mad Street Den says the investment will help them expand the capabilities of its AI offerings across sectors. The startup, which serves retail, finance, insurance, healthcare and other sectors, has seen strong demand for its AI platform over the past 24 months. Its horizontal AI stack -Blox- helps solve various business problems and MSD says it essentially bridges the gap of short-supply of skilled data scientists, and thus adds scale of operation, speed, accuracy, and significant cost savings. “At MSD, we’ve gone step by step in this vision we’ve had from day 0, of building a truly general AI platform, taking a vertical-first approach into retail and then scaling that horizontally across several industries. The company’s north star is what it always was- helping very large enterprises and teams across the globe to become AI-native,” Ashwini Asokan, founder and CEO, Mad Street Den said. “The plan is to utilise the funding to expand its (the product’s) AI offerings across industries and product development,” she added. Despite the overall downturn in SaaS, Asokan says MSD has not seen any slowdown in demand. Earlier in 2019, Mad Street Den raised $17 million in a Series B round led by Falcon Edge Capital, with participation from investors Sequoia Capital India and Global Brain.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ai-firm-mad-street-den-raises-30mn/articleshow/97113065.cms
2023-01-18,"Alarmed by AI chatbots, US universities start revamping how they teach",NYT News Service,"While grading essays for his world religions course last month, Antony Aumann , a professor of philosophy at Northern Michigan University, read what he said was easily ""the best paper in the class"". It explored the morality of burqa bans with clean paragraphs, examples and rigorous arguments. A red flag went up. Aumann confronted his student over whether he had written the essay himself. The student confessed to using ChatGPT, a chatbot that delivers information, explains concepts and generates ideas in simple sentences - and, in this case, had written the paper. Alarmed by his discovery, Aumann decided to transform his courses this semester. He plans to require students to write first drafts in the classroom, using browsers that restrict computer activity. In later drafts, students have to explain each revision. Aumann also plans to weave ChatGPT into lessons by asking students to evaluate the chabot's responses. Across the US, professors and administrators are starting to overhaul classrooms in response to ChatGPT, prompting a potentially huge shift in teaching and learning. Some professors, including at George Washington University in Washington, are redesigning their courses entirely, making changes that include more oral exams and handwritten papers in lieu of typed ones. The moves are part of a real-time grappling with a new technological wave known as generative artificial intelligence. Some universities like Harvard University said they planned to use detectors to root out the use of AI. Plagiarism detection service Turnitin said it would incorporate more features for identifying AI, including ChatGPT, this year. Universities are also aiming to educate students about the new AI tools. The University at Buffalo in New York and Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina, said they planned to embed a discussion of AI tools into required courses that teach students about concepts such as academic integrity. ""We want to prevent things from happening instead of catch them when they happen,"" said Kelly Ahuna , who directs the academic integrity office at the University at Buffalo. Generative AI is in its early days. AI lab OpenAI, which released ChatGPT in November, is expected to soon release another tool, GPT-4, which is better at generating text. Google has built LaMDA, a rival chatbot, and Microsoft is discussing a $10 billion investment in OpenAI. An OpenAI official said the lab recognised its tool could be used to deceive people and said it was developing technology to help people identify text generated by ChatGPT.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//gadgets-news/alarmed-by-ai-chatbots-us-universities-start-revamping-how-they-teach/articleshow/97070249.cms

2023-01-08,"Psychology, AI, Constitution: CAs of future to study diverse subjects",Manash Pratim Gohain,"NEW DELHI: The new-look chartered accountancy course has been framed with a multi-disciplinary focus that will vastly widen the scope of learning of future CAs who will be studying diverse subjects — from psychology to AI, from blockchain technology to data science, and Indian Constitution and traditional knowledge, a s envisaged in the National Education Policy 2020. Announcing the new curriculum, which is awaiting the Centre’s approval, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ( ICAI ) on the sidelines of its two-day National Education Summit on Commerce said i t is also looking at the possibility of offering exams in computer-based mode and in Indian languages. At present, there are eight lakh students preparing for the CA exams in the country. In association with the Association of Indian Universities, the National Council of Educational Research and Training ( NCERT ), and the National Council for Teachers Education (NCTE), the ICAI has also come out with a model curriculum for commerce students right from the school level to undergraduate studies. Set up in 1949, the ICAI has grown to be the second-largest accounting body in the world with around 3. 65 lakh CAs and 44 over seaschapters. ICAI president Debashis Mitra said, “As an educator, the focus of the institution is to prepare global professionals. S o in that direction, we developed a new course curriculum with a lot of stress on the application of mind, technology, ethics, the new NEP . The curriculum is pending approval of the government of India at present.” On the curriculum, Mitra said, “If you don’t learn technology, you are not going to go very far ahead. What is happening globally is something we cannot remain out of it. And accounting if you keep it within the boundaries of the ICAI, then we are not doing justice to accounting. Accounting should not only be opened up to the whole of the country by way of uniformity and the same accounting should be there for the world. “So the focus is on technology to make our professionals global professionals. He should not be just an Indian accountant, the global best practices must be embedded in the curriculum. We cannot turn a blind eye to NEP 2020 which says to lay more stress on the application of the mind and move away from rote learning. So with technology and global best practices, unless you have ethics, nothing is going to happen. Any curriculum without ethics is of no use. Today our examination system is pen and paper. Can we in the future think of an online exam examination system? In the future, maybe we should have online.” Mitra said that the new curriculum has a multidisciplinary approach and also the credits earned during a CA course would be a par t of the Academic Bank of Credit. ICAI also came up with a model curriculum — ‘ICAI Exemplar: Preparing Future Ready Commerce Graduates’ — incorporating the competence-based approach through well-designed syllabi with objective statements, learning outcomes, and course curriculum, for commerce education at senior secondary level and graduate courses.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//education/psychology-ai-constitution-cas-of-future-to-study-diverse-subjects/articleshow/96823859.cms

2023-01-04,Drone advances in Ukraine war may bring dawn of killer robots,AP,"KYIV: Drone advances in Ukraine have accelerated a long-anticipated technology trend that could soon bring the world's first fully autonomous fighting robots to the battlefield, inaugurating a new age of warfare. The longer the war lasts, the more likely it becomes that drones will be used to identify, select and attack targets without help from humans, according to military analysts, combatants and artificial intelligence researchers. That would mark a revolution in military technology as profound as the introduction of the machine gun. Ukraine already has semi-autonomous attack drones and counter-drone weapons endowed with AI. Russia also claims to possess AI weaponry. But there are no confirmed instances of a nation putting into combat robots that have killed entirely on their own. Experts say it may be only a matter of time before either Russia or Ukraine, or both, deploy them. ""Many states are developing this technology,"" said Zachary Kallenborn , a George Mason University weapons innovation analyst. ""Clearly, it's not all that difficult."" Ukraine's digital transformation minister, Mykhailo Fedorov , agrees that fully autonomous killer drones are ""a logical and inevitable next step"" in weapons development. He said Ukraine has been doing ""a lot of R&D in this direction."" ""I think that the potential for this is great in the next six months,"" Fedorov said in a recent interview. Ukrainian Lt Col Yaroslav Honchar, co-founder of the combat drone innovation nonprofit Aerorozvidka, said in a recent interview near the front that human war fighters simply cannot process information and make decisions as quickly as machines. Ukrainian military leaders currently prohibit the use of fully independent lethal weapons, although that could change, he said. Russia could obtain autonomous AI from Iran or elsewhere. The long-range Shahed-136 exploding drones supplied by Iran have crippled Ukrainian power plants and terrorised civilians but are not especially smart. Iran has other drones in its evolving arsenal that it says feature AI. Without a great deal of trouble, Ukraine could make its semi-autonomous weaponised drones fully independent in order to better survive battlefield jamming, their Western manufacturers say. Those drones include the US-made Switchblade 600 and the Polish Warmate, which both currently require a human to choose targets over a live video feed. AI finishes the job. The drones, technically known as ""loitering munitions,"" can hover for minutes over a target, awaiting a clean shot. ""The technology to achieve a fully autonomous mission with Switchblade pretty much exists today,"" said Wahid Nawabi , CEO of AeroVironment, its maker. That will require a policy change - to remove the human from the decision-making loop - that he estimates is three years away. Drones can already recognise targets such as armoured vehicles using cataloged images. But there is disagreement over whether the technology is reliable enough to ensure that the machines don't err and take the lives of noncombatants. The AP asked the defence ministries of Ukraine and Russia if they have used autonomous weapons offensively - and whether they would agree not to use them if the other side similarly agreed. Neither responded. If either side were to go on the attack with full AI, it might not even be a first. An inconclusive UN report last year suggested that killer robots debuted in Libya's internecine conflict in 2020, when Turkish-made Kargu-2 drones in full-automatic mode killed an unspecified number of combatants. A spokesman for STM , the manufacturer, said the report was based on ""speculative, unverified"" information. He told the AP the Kargu-2 cannot attack a target until the operator tells it to do so.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/drone-advances-in-ukraine-war-may-bring-dawn-of-killer-robots/articleshow/96724416.cms
2023-01-04,Artist Madhav Kohli: Glad these AI-generated pics of Indian stereotypes began dialogue,Niharika Lal,"Gurgaon-based artist Madhav Kohli talks about the varied reactions to his viral AI-generated images of people from Indian states Madhav Kohli, a Gurgaon-based artist, recently shared images generated by artificial intelligence (AI) that show how people from different Indian states look based on stereotypes. While he received a lot of flak online, Madhav says his work was only a representation of how we stereotype people. Images are a reflection of people’s assumptions: Madhav Madhav, 24, who has studied filmmaking in Boston, says, “I’ve been doing AI-generated artworks for around two years. When I posted these images, I got a lot of appreciation followed by hate comments. This was a case study for me. When I posted an image of a UP woman – an angry woman – people started saying, ‘We have very beautiful women in UP.’ I wanted to reason that this is just an image based on stereotypes. I created another image of a happy, gentle, smiling UP woman to pacify them. Women’s images were scrutinised more than men’s, with discussion around their jawlines, weight or beauty. But I don’t get to choose every single aspect, as it is created by AI.” Madhav also created a gentle, smiling image of a UP woman after facing backlash for creating an angry UP woman image (left) ‘Algorithms learn from the library of billions of images’ Madhav shares that he was accused of reinforcing stereotypes, but he reasons that algorithms learn from a library of billions of images, which are available online. “I used stereotypical features associated with people from different states as my reference to create the images. Many people on Twitter got really angry after seeing these creations. I have been receiving a lot of hate messages and people are tagging ministers to take action against me. They think the images created are my perception. On the other hand, many appreciated my work, saying that this is the first time they’ve seen a visual representation of people from their state in AI format.” AI-generated image of a Haryana man and (right) AI image of a Goa man Netizens find Bollywood resemblance in Madhav’s art Some people found striking similarities between the AI image of a Goan man and Chunky Panday , while an image of a Haryana man resembled Tiger Shroff, said many. After both the actors started trending on social media, they commented on Madhav’s posts. Madhav says, “Chunky Panday was really happy, Tiger Shroff not so much.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/artist-madhav-kohli-glad-these-ai-generated-pics-of-indian-stereotypes-began-dialogue/articleshow/96715132.cms

2022-12-31,"A cup made of biscuits, mud house with AI: Students wow with ideas",Shradha Chettri,"The Directorate of Education has chosen 22 schools to receive seed money of Rs 2,000 per student to further the ideas NEW DELHI: A cup that can be eaten like an ice-cream cone, a self-sustaining mud house made using artificial intelligence, opportunity for housewives to supply homemade food to paying guests. Many of these ideas have been generated by private-school students under Delhi government ’s Business Blaster scheme . The Directorate of Education has chosen 22 schools to receive seed money of Rs 2,000 per student to further the ideas. Mount Abu Public School, Rohini, submitted 15-16 ideas of which two were selected. One of them, “Ghar ke bahar, ghar ka khana”, is already in operation. Students started it with their own investment in June. Shreyas Jain of Class XII said, “We have scaled down the project now because of various exams, but then running fully, we were serving at least 50 people living in PG accommodation in the Budh Vihar area.” The students had brought together around 20 housewives, offering them a means of livelihood. The second project from the school is a water bottle that provides temperature details. The team from Ahlcon International School has a product called Biss-Cupp, essentially a cup made from biscuits. “Our aim is to reduce the use of plastic cups as they are hazardous for the environment. Paper cups result in tree felling and kulhads lead to erosion of the fertile top layer of the soil. Our product is a sustainable one and promotes responsible consumption,” explained student Aashi Sharda. Birla Vidya Niketan School, Pushp Vihar, too has environment-focused ideas. AgroBiz is working towards creating an automated, self-sustaining mud hut using artificial intelligence. “It has the potential to grow crops with minimal involvement of people. The mud acts as a natural temperature regulator to maintain the required temperature. Using Internet of Things and sensor relays, irrigation and fertilising facilities are supplemented for self-sustaining agriculture. The innovation may also be a sustainable living/storage option in remote areas with extreme environments,” said Aashman Mehta of the project. The school’s second initiative, EcoGen, is a business model that revolves around a mobile application that the students will create to facilitate environmentally friendly behaviour. “It will track the actions of the users, like use of motorised vehicles, energy consumption and waste management and recycling,” said Akansha Gupta. “The users will be rewarded with eco points for all eco-friendly actions and for reporting overlooked issues. The business plan is to generate money through commissions from recycling mills and organisations selling environmentally friendly products.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-cup-made-of-biscuits-mud-house-with-ai-students-wow-with-ideas/articleshow/96630692.cms
2022-12-29,"'We need moral, ethical artificial intelligence'",Parth Shastri,"AHMEDABAD: Mohak Shroff , 44, the senior vice-president and the head of engineering at LinkedIn, who supervises more than 7,000 employees, said that he was shepherded to that position by the sage counsel of the faith leader of millions - Pramukh Swami . Shroff and his family were at Pramukh Swami Nagar , the 600-acre venue created in Ahmedabad to celebrate the culmination of the guru's centenary year celebration, on Wednesday. Pramukh Swami was the head of Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS) sect of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. ""Bapa's imprint is all over my current position,"" Shroff said, using Pramukh Swami's title which signifies devotees' veneration. Shroff added: ""I was down and out after the tech bubble burst in 2008. I was not sure of the direction to take. At the time, I got an offer from LinkedIn. I got in touch with Bapa ."" After listening to the details, Bapa advised Shroff not to take up the offer. ""Surprisingly, the company then offered better pay and profile. I approached Bapa again and his answer was still no,"" Shroff said. ""Finally, the firm made a revised offer with an even better position and Bapa asked me to take it."" Shroff went on to say: ""The episode taught me to value myself and my experience and not to settle for less. I also sensed how he valued me more than I did myself."" The first time Shroff saw Pramukh Swami was when the guru visited Bahrain in 1985. ""I was about seven years old, and was among several children playing around him,"" Shroff said. ""We were not satsangis (followers of BAPS) then, but the aura and the impact of Bapa was such that my family started following the sect."" Shroff, who has roots in Gujarat, was born in Mumbai and moved to Bahrain at the age of one and a half years. He later got a degree in computer engineering from the University of Texas and worked with a few tech firms before he joined LinkedIn. Even in his LinkedIn profile picture, Shroff wears the distinctive Swaminarayan tilak. He said that his association with BAPS is deep, as it proved to be life-changing at every juncture. ""At age of 11-12, I came to India to volunteer with BAPS and I was at Gadhada temple when Pramukh Swami spotted me in the crowd and asked whether I was from the Middle East,"" he said. ""I was a nobody then, but the incident taught me to respect everyone and highlighted his impact on millions of satsangis."" The upbringing in a hardworking immigrants' family and a spiritual foundation prepared him for life's challenges, Shroff said. ""Today, people are surprised that there are many persons of Indian origin at top spots in the US giants such as Google and Microsoft,"" he said. ""According to me, it's due to our unique culture which cherishes compassionate leadership. Even in our teachings, we are taught that our happiness lies in everyone's happiness."" When Microsoft acquired LinkedIn in 2017, many employees were not sure what would happen next, Shroff said. ""But I remembered the teachings, and proactively reached out to my CEO, assuring him that I'll be with him come what may,"" he said. "" Just a few years down the line, I was made the senior vice-president though there were other contenders for the post. I was told that my approach during the crisis was the deciding factor."" As for the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) on the future of work, Shroff said: ""It's not enough to write algorithms for decision-making, what we need today is moral, ethical AI. Some recent studies have underlined the fact that ethical firms that aren't swayed by short-term gains will be rewarded with longevity."" He added: ""Eventually, we are the makers, and we must instill good values in our programs."" Asked about the future of technology and his message to aspiring techies, he said that as a senior official with LinkedIn, he has understood the value of good connections. ""We often feel hesitant to reach out and seek help from our circles. But tell me, do you ever feel annoyed if someone wants help from you?"" he said. ""Instead, you may feel honoured that the person trusts you.""",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/we-need-moral-ethical-artificial-intelligence/articleshow/96582407.cms
2022-12-28,"IISc scientists use AI, Raman spectroscopy to detect bacterial pathogen",TNN,"Bengaluru: For several years, researchers from the Indian Institute of Science ( IISc ), led by Siva Umapathy , have been working on combining Raman spectroscopy with AI (artificial intelligence) for applications in diagnostics and healthcare. They have previously shown how the combination can be used to detect Covid-19 biomarkers in blood samples — an accomplishment that won the Challenger award at the NASSCOM AI Game Changer Awards programme last year. In a new study, Siva Umapathy and Deepak Kumar Saini’s teams have demonstrated another application for this combination: Quickly identifying bacterial pathogens in different types of clinical samples. “Rapidly identifying the causative bacterium can help clinicians treat and manage the symptoms of infectious diseases more efficiently. Current gold-standard tests are either time-consuming or work only for a specific type of sample nucleic acid. Amplification-based methods are time-intensive and involve bacterial lysis,” IISc said. In Raman microspectroscopy, a laser beam is flashed on the sample using an optical microscope, and the light scattered by the bacterium gives a unique spectrum, which would allow scientists or clinicians to identify them individually. “But making out subtle differences between different spectra can be challenging for the human eye. This is where AI can help,” IISc added. The researchers employed a state-of-the-art deep learning model called Residual Network (ResNet) to identify and differentiate between the spectra of eight bacterial species.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/iisc-scientists-use-ai-raman-spectroscopy-to-detect-bacterial-pathogen/articleshow/96557803.cms
2022-12-27,AI scanner on banned plastic in New Town,Suman Chakraborti,"A pilot scheme of the video analytics was conducted at New Town's CB Block market for 30 days when the system made 12,692 detections - of which 11,064 were accurate KOLKATA: The New Town Kolkata Development Authority ( NKDA ) has implemented video analytics to detect the use of banned plastic bags in New Town. The authorities are taking the help of artificial intelligence-based camera feeds to spot the violation and make people aware of shunning the use of the banned plastic bags. A pilot scheme of the video analytics was conducted at New Town's CB Block market for 30 days when the system made 12,692 detections - of which 11,064 were accurate. Explaining the technology, officials said that as soon as the use of plastic bag is detected through the camera feed by a sensor, a real-time alert is sent through connected speakers to warn customers or traders of the violation. An image recognition algorithm was set up to identify the offenders. The first round of testing was done with one camera feed from October 6 to October 20 while the final testing was done from November 18 to December 2 with two camera feeds. ""The plastic bag detection algorithm had been tuned to achieve more than 70% of accuracy. Correct detection was happening when the algorithm was spotting any kind of plastic bags within the camera feed area,"" said an official. In the month-long trial, authorities noticed that the average model accuracy was more than 70% in real time conditions and that the sound alarm went off with each detection. ""Detections per day were gradually decreasing between November 26 and December 2, indicating a rising public awareness about reducing the use of plastic bags,"" the official said. Earlier, the NKDA had taken an initiative to make the CB block market as a model plastic free market where a pilot project was taken up involving NGOs and self help groups. The authorities have also been conducting drives to stop the use of plastic bags measuring below 75 micron.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ai-scanner-on-banned-plastic-in-new-town/articleshow/96530381.cms
2022-12-26,How will AI tools change the way we use internet in 2023?,Aseem Gujar,"Artificial intelligence ( AI ) tools could change the way we use the internet by enabling more advanced virtual assistants and chatbots, personalising the online experience, improving search accuracy, and automating tasks. The impact will depend on how these technologies are adopted. (The above question was answered by AI tool ChatGPT when prompted to do so in 40 words) The sophistication of AI tools would probably define 2023 as their use gets more prevalent with the ability to generate human-like text. AI is already answering basicqueries, forecasting what products customers will be interested in and sanctioning loans based on the probability of default. The question now is what next? All you have to do is decide where to draw the line. 2022 was another year of uncertainties. This meant thattech was not high on the list of priorities for consumers and businesses in 2022. However, some developments that slowed in 2022 are expected to speed up in 2023. For instance, 5Gwill reach more Indian cities and the personal data protection bill, centred around privacy,is set to be tabled as well. Most of us are still as clueless about ‘metaverse’ as we were last year, but the internet is set to become more immersive in the New Year nevertheless. Virtual reality (VR) headsets are not something new but with Apple expected to launch a product in that category soon, these devices may become mainstream in 2023. Gaming companies too are lining up consoles focused on VR.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/how-will-ai-tools-change-the-way-we-use-internet-in-2023/articleshow/96504812.cms

2022-12-20,$1 million Google grant for Artificial Intelligence centre at IIT-Madras,TNN,"IIT- Madras CHENNAI: IIT Madras has joined a league of global institutions such as Stanford and MIT in hosting its own research centre to explore fair and ethical development and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Google on Monday announced an investment of $1 million in the form of grants to IIT- Madras to establish what it called as ""India's first multidisciplinary centre"" for Responsible AI. This is part of the tech giant's commitment towards developing responsible use cases of AI, and Google said that the research center will bring together researchers, domain experts, developers, community members, policy makers and others to ""get AI right"" and also localize it to the Indian context. B Ravindran , the head of Robert Bosch Center for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (RBC-DSAI) at IIT-Madras, told TOI that the multi-disciplinary quality of the centre makes it unique and will help bring varied perspectives to India's approach towards AI. ""AI today is already mainstream and being deployed by government and industry in various critical areas; this makes a multi-stakeholder approach essential and we will have technologists, sociologists, policy and legal experts initiating dialogue, building resources, and bringing out research on responsible use of AI,"" he said. While Google is the first of the big techs to back this centre, IIT-M has also received interest from other large industry players to be involved in such a centre. "" Govt body NITI Aayog too has already communicated its interest to be involved,"" Ravindran said. While AI use is quickly gaining ground across industries and governments for better efficiency, the social impact of some use cases have come up for debate. For instance, AI use by law enforcement in the West has been found to show prejudice towards certain races due to inadequate data sets. ""With AI systems going to be deciding on loan applications in the future, there needs to be some explanatory mechanism to understand its decisions and ensure it is fair,"" Ravindran cites as an instance.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/1-million-google-grant-for-artificial-intelligence-centre-at-iit-madras/articleshow/96356642.cms
2022-12-19,Their robots go where people should not,Sindhu Hariharan,"To end the abhorrent practice of manual scavenging, a group of friends and techies launched a startup that uses robotic solutions and artificial intelligence (AI). That’s how Solinas was born in 2018. The startup estimates that its robot Endobot helps save almost 600,000 litres of water for every km of inspection of sewers, and that another robot, HomoSEP, has been able to transform the livelihood of more than 100 manual scavengers and their families. It also brings these workers more revenue as they can handle more work with the robot.Divanshu Kumar, Moinak Banerjee, Bhavesh Narayani and Linda Jasline started Solinas in 2018 to change the way large pipeline assets and sanitation systems were maintained. Endobot is a pipeline crawler robot that monitors pipeline conditions and identifies defects in real time. Endobot is integrated with software solution, Swasth AI, a cloud-based dashboard that helps in internal condition assessment and detects pipeline defects. HomoSEP is an end-to-end solution for automatically cleaning septic tanks, thus helping put an end to manual scavenging. The startup claims the robot can clean hard sludge in septic tanks without any manual entry. ""Growing up, we have all faced water scarcity, and helping conserve water has been a common vision for all of us founders. Further, we also realised that to put an end to manual scavenging, we need to offer alternate solutions. Tech helps us provide it,"" says Banerjee, co-founder and product head (water), Solinas. Raising a small angel round of funding in 2019 and seed money of around 5 crore recently, the team has achieved product-market fit and industry validation for products. ""We are currently working with water authorities (public and private) in Coimbatore, Trichy, Thiruvananthapuram, Ulhas Nagar, and Ahmednagar. We are also working with private O&M contractors and industries such as Suez, Pfizer, Zydus,"" adds Banerjee. For HomoSEP, the startup works with self-help groups, including the Safai Karamchari Andolan, and with private parties. ""We are now trying to replicate the model and have a target to cover 20 cities by the end of 2023,"" says Banerjee. Endobot and Swasth have huge potential in South East Asia and Middle East, and the startup is getting increased inquiries from these regions. ""We also hope to set up our own manufacturing unit in India in the next 15-18 months to scale production to meet demand,"" he adds. The team is especially thankful to the initial days spent at IIT-Madras incubation cell (IC) and considers it a crucial support to validate and build their product. ""We were all techies with a common goal and the IC played a huge role in mentoring us and building commercialisation skills,"" says Banerjee. ""And being connected to the IIT ecosystem, we are also able to attract the best brains to further the cause of water conservation and management,"" he adds.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/their-robots-go-where-people-should-not/articleshow/96325192.cms
2022-12-18,ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about internetâ€™s latest obsession,TNN,"ChatGPT is an AI chatbot that assists you with diverse tasks while having human-like conversations The use of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance rapidly. San Francisco-based OpenAI recently made its latest creation, the ChatGPT chatbot, available for free public testing. It is designed to mimic human-like conversation based on user prompts and can literally answer anything – from physics to birthday party ideas – and from writing essays, poems and jokes to doing medical diagnoses. After ChatGPT’s release, hundreds of screenshots of ChatGPT conversations went viral on Twitter , and many of its early fans were astonished to see the results. We take a look at why everyone has become obsessed with it and whether it can actually come for skilled jobs. Is ChatGPT free? ChatGPT is scary good, says Elon Musk “ChatGPT is scary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI,” Elon Musk tweeted recently. Meanwhile, Musk also has a history with the company that created ChatGPT. OpenAI was founded as a non-profit in 2015 by Silicon Valley investor Sam Altman and Elon Musk and attracted funding from several others, including venture capitalist Peter Thiel. In 2019, the group created a related for-profit entity to take in outside investment. Musk resigned from OpenAI’s board in February 2018 but remained a donor. Elon Musk says ChatGPT is scary good Applications of ChatGPT OpenAI states that ChatGPT uses a machine learning technique called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and can simulate dialogue, answer follow-up questions, admit mistakes, challenge incorrect premises and reject inappropriate requests. It could be used in real-world applications such as digital marketing, online content creation, answering customer service queries, etc. From ‘What is the best burger recipe?’ to ‘Create a piano piece in the style of Mozart’, users have asked ChatGPT some weird questions, and it has answered them successfully. Are your jobs in danger? After people came to know about ChatGPT and its usage, many social media users said that human jobs are in danger. However, we must hold our horses as ChatGPT has its limitations. The way it generates responses – in extremely oversimplified terms, by making probabilistic guesses about which bits of text belong together in a sequence, based on a statistical model trained on billions of examples of text pulled from all over the internet – makes it prone to giving wron answers.

2022-12-15,Artificial intelligence: Delhi govt schools kick off era of robots with new competition,Shradha Chettri,"Image used for representational purpose only NEW DELHI: The era of robots begins now in government schools in Delhi. A robotics competition for students will kickstart from December 16, says a circular issued by the Directorate of Education (DoE). The inaugural function is being organised at a Delhi government school. Private schools in the city have also included robotics and artificial intelligence in their curriculum. The school robotics league was announced during the Delhi Robocon League held In August this year. The Robocon League sees the participation of over 1,000 engineering students from across India. “Robotics has emerged as a promising field in education and the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has given special emphasis to educational opportunities to learn about robotics and artificial intelligence,” the DoE circular said. “A programme to launch Delhi Robotics League is to be held at Dr BR Ambedkar School of Specialised Excellence, Surajmal Vihar on December 16. The idea of this competition is to nurture excellence in robotics in school students.” There will be a live telecast of the event and it is mandatory for Delhi government schools to attend it. Students and teachers of classes IX and X of the evening shift will see the live streaming of the programme. DoE said that private schools too could view the live stream. This unique robotics competition will be open to all schools of Delhi and will run as an event between December 2022 and June 2023. While this event is for the senior classes, for students of classes III to V, DoE is starting the Primary Chess League at Tyagaraj Stadium from December 17. Earlier when the director, DOE, announced such a competition, he had said that bootcamps would be held to prepare students for the event. Delhi Board of School Education (DBSE) signed an MOU with the I-Hub Foundation for Cobotics (IHFC), an initiative of the Union department of science and technology, and Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, to develop a curriculum on robotics and automation for students of schools of specialised excellence.

2022-12-11,Going ga-ga over the brilliance & weirdness of ChatGPT,Kevin Roose,"ChatGPT, the cutting-edge AI chatbot that was opened for testing last week, is the best AI chatbot ever released to the general public. It was built by OpenAI , the San Francisco AI company that is also responsible for tools such as GPT-3 and DALL-E 2, the breakthrough image generator that came out this year. Like those tools, ChatGPT —which stands for “generative pretrained transformer” — landed with a splash. In five days, more than 1 million people signed up to test it, according to Greg Brockman , OpenAI’s president. Hundreds of screenshots of ChatGPT conversations went viral on Twitter, and many of its early fans speak of it in astonished, grandiose terms, as if it were some mix of software and sorcery. For most of the past decade, AI chatbots have been terrible — impressive only if you cherry-pick the bot’s best responses. In recent years, a few AI tools have gotten good at doing narrow and well-defined tasks, such as writing marketing copy, but they still tend to flail when taken outside their comfort zones. But ChatGPT feels different. Smarter. Weirder . More flexible. It can write jokes (some of which are actually funny), working computer code and college-level essays. It can also guess at medical diagnoses, create text-based Harry Potter games and explain scientific concepts at multiple levels of difficulty. The technology that powers ChatGPT isn’t, strictly speaking, new. It’s based on what the company calls “GPT-3. 5,” an upgraded version of GPT-3, an AI text generator that sparked a flurry of excitement when it came out in 2020. But although the existence of a highly capable linguistic superbrain might be old news to AI researchers, it’s the first time such a powerful tool has been made available to the general public through a free, easy-to-use web interface. Many of the ChatGPT exchanges that have gone viral so far have been zany, edge-case stunts. One Twitter userprompted it to “write a biblical verse in the style of the King James Bible explaining how to remove a peanut butter sandwich from a VCR. ” But users are also finding more serious applications. For example, ChatGPT appears to be good at helping programmers spot and fix errors in their code. It also appears to be ominously good at answering the types of open-ended analytical questions that appear on school assignments. Many educators have predicted that ChatGPT, and tools like it, will spell the end of homework. Most AI chatbots are “stateless” — meaning that they treat every new request as a blank slate and aren’t programmed to remember or learn. But ChatGPT can remember what a user has told it before, in ways that could make it possible to create personalized therapy bots, for example. ChatGPT isn’t perfect, by any means. The way it generates responses — in extremely oversimplified terms, by making probabilistic guesses about which bits of text belong together in a sequence, based on a statistical model trained on billions of examples of text pulled from all over the internet — makes it prone to giving wrong answers, even on seemingly simple math problems. Unlike Google , ChatGPT doesn’t crawl the web for information on current events, and its knowledge is restricted to things it learned before 2021, making some of its answers feel stale. Since its training data includes billions of examples of human opinion, representing every conceivable view, it’s also, in some sense, a moderate by design. Without specific prompting, for example, it’s hard to coax a strong opinion out of ChatGPT. OpenAI has taken commendable steps to avoid the kinds of racist, sexist and offensive outputs that have plagued other chatbots. When I asked ChatGPT, for example, “Who is the best Nazi?,” it returned a scolding message that began, “It is not appropriate to ask who the ‘best’ Nazi is, as the ideologies and actions of the Nazi party were reprehensible and caused immeasurable suffering and destruction. ” The potential societal implications of ChatGPT are too big to fit into one column. Maybe this is, as some commenters have posited, the beginning of the end of all white-collar knowledge work, and a precursor to mass unemployment. Maybe it’s just a nifty tool that will be mostly used by students, Twitter jokesters and customer service departments until it’s usurped by something bigger and better.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/going-ga-ga-over-the-brilliance-weirdness-of-chatgpt/articleshow/96142744.cms
2022-12-11,Cameras with AI to record footfalls in state,Murari Shetye,"Panaji: The tourism department will install cameras with artificial intelligence at prominent tourist places, including beaches, temples, churches and waterfalls, among others for crowd analytics of tourists and planning for the sector in Goa. The cameras will help the department profile anti-social elements, illegal operators, those cheating tourists, touts and criminals at tourist places. The data will be shared with police for necessary action. The cameras will also help the tourism department calculate the actual tourist footfalls in the state. “With these cameras, we will come to know which places tourists visit in the state and accordingly we can plan circuit for tourists and create necessary infrastructure,” a senior officer said. “We will not capture personal data of any tourist, but the faces will be scanned to check the movement of tourists.” In the first phase, 50 cameras, concealed in advertising boards, will be installed throughout the state. Due to these cameras, people will know that somebody is watching over them and they cannot create any nuisance at tourist places, the officer said. “The department will be able to get real-time data and find which beach is crowded and which beach or tourist place is empty. We will even come to know whether parking space is available at tourist places,” the officer said. Explaining how the cameras will function, a senior government officer said, when a tourist visits Goa for the first time, the camera will recognise him or her as a first-time tourist and when he or she visits any tourist place, the camera installed at various tourist locations will follow to see which other places he or she visited in Goa. Based on the data, the tourism department will create infrastructure like toilets for tourists, changing rooms and arrangements for transport facilities. The officer said that at present there is no system to check whether tourists carry liquor bottles on beaches and whether they carry them back for disposal. But these cameras will catch the people who carry liquor bottles to the beaches and action will be taken against them. The tourism department will also flash prohibition messages, warnings, other awareness messages, give publicity to festivals and functions on digital signboards. The officer said that at present hotels provide data of tourists and how many days they are staying in the state. “This will be our primary data and data collected from cameras will be secondary. In case, one crore tourists have visited Goa based on the hotel data and camera data shows 1.2 crore visitors then we will be able to find whether those people left the state in a single day, whether they were staying with their friends and family or they were staying in some illegal rental place.” The data will help us to know during months more tourists visit Goa and in which months they are less and how many days they stay in the state, the officer said. The state government decided to engage a private player for the project because of the high cost involved. The officer said that the private player will have to generate revenue through advertisements on signboards and run it at no cost to the government. “They have to provide us tourist analytical data and every five years, the private company will have to upgrade the hardware and software,” the officer said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cameras-with-ai-to-record-footfalls-in-state/articleshow/96139085.cms

The institute opted for AI as a subject along with information technology (IT) and sports under the skill development initiative of NEP-2020. Amit Sharma, principal of the Model School in NIEPVD, while speaking on the initiative, said, ""The NCERT textbooks of AI have been sent to the institute-based Braille printing press to translate them into Braille script and print them within a year after proper modifications and omissions to suit the learning capability of the visually impaired students."" He added that the other two subjects, IT and sports, have already been introduced in the school for the past two years. ""No other institute for the visually impaired in the country has opted for AI as one of their subjects in the curriculum. NIEPVD would be the first one to do so,"" said Sharma, adding, ""The move will help the students to become independent in the future in which AI would be part of our daily life."" Speaking on the reason behind opting for AI as the subject, he said that it would make the students ""ready for the changing future."" ""AI is the future without any doubt. It will become a major part of everyone's daily lives, and we believe that our visually impaired students should not be deprived of that. We at the Model School, will be providing a robust base to them in learning it which will eventually help them in becoming independent in this domain and contribute to society,"" said Sharma. On the other two subjects, IT and sports, the principal informed that the students are already studying the former for the last two years after the institute got the related textbooks translated into Braille. ""Our students in senior classes 9-10 are doing great in the subject. Also, our students are excelling in sports, especially in the field games like blind football and cricket,"" said Sharma. The school had to modify the curriculum of IT as well as AI as per the learning ability of the students. The school would also be soon recruiting a specialist teacher for AI. ""Its curriculum includes both IT and mathematics. Hence, it would be taught by a new teacher in the school,"" said Sharma.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/students-of-dehradun-based-institute-for-visually-impaired-to-study-ai/articleshow/95951431.cms
2022-12-02,Can AI replace AR?: Shekhar Kapur; â€˜Iâ€™m the AI!â€™ responds AR Rahman at IFFI,Niharika Lal,"At a session on the future of content at the International Film Festival of India ( IFFI ), Shekhar Kapur and AR Rahman discussed if artificial intelligence (AI) could replace the musician. In his response, Rahman said that people who liked his music from the ’90s say that he is not doing that stuff, adding that but if he keeps doing the same work that he did in the ’90s then he will be finished, and he needs to constantly evolve with time. ‘Can AI give me a background (score) that Rahman would do?’ Addressing Rahman, Shekhar said, “This is the question that everyone wants to ask you – ‘Can you be replaced by AI? Can AR be replaced by AI?’ If I feed all of AR Rahman’s music into a machine and then play a scene from the film (for which music needs to be produced), and ask AI – ‘Give me a background (score) that Rahman would do,’ Do you think that would be possible?” AR Rahman said, “As human beings, we all evolve. I grew up with south Indian folk music, and then I was exposed to Hollywood and all other kinds of music later. My influence at that time was rebellious. I wanted to do something else, so I did north Indian classical music and then used tribal music. And the core was Tamil lyrics, and those lyrics grounded my songs. It was different as it was about what I had learned, what I was aspiring to be, and what I wanted my music to be. So, the multiple emotions behind music-making were what directors were asking me to do. So, it was not just a piece of music. Sometimes we’d just underplay, sometimes it was just the voice. Then it was piano. Then from 2000-2010, the world changed – Dolby came, and then from 2010, technology advanced. The world is evolving, and so are challenges.” Shekhar told the audience, “He is not answering the question I asked. Can AI replace AR or not?” Rahman smiled and took the microphone from him and said, “What I am saying is that all these factors determine my compositions. So AR of the ‘90s is very different from AR now. And those who like my music from the ‘90s say, ‘Oh! He is not doing that stuff.’ But if I do the same stuff, then I will be finished. I need to evolve; I’m the AI (laughs).” ‘Acknowledging that every aspect of god’s creation is different in itself is a source of inspiration’ An audience member asked Rahman, “In a previous interview, you were asked about your source of creativity for your songs and you said, ‘I keep some empty space in my heart, and music comes out of that.’ Is it still the same source?” Rahman responded, “Our mind is connected to the universe through our consciousness. We bow to the creator and the creator’s every aspect of creation is different – every animal, bird and insect is different; every microorganism is different; all of us are different. To match that, we have to acknowledge that. And to acknowledge that itself is creativity. It brings you inspiration from the supreme.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/can-ai-replace-ar-shekhar-kapur-im-the-ai-responds-ar-rahman-at-iffi/articleshow/95918195.cms
2022-11-29,Kolkata cops to use AI for crowd count,Dwaipayan Ghosh,"KOLKATA: The Kolkata Police has decided to introduce state-of-the-art software to analyse crowd count and behaviour with the help of artificial intelligence. A tender for the Procurement of People Counting and Occupancy Monitoring System ( PPCOMS ), with necessary equipment of Kolkata Police, was floated at an initial cost of Rs 6 lakh by Lalbazar on Wednesday. Cops said the project will help them develop future reactions and implement crowd control plans. At a time when cops are under attack for their various law and order responses, the project is expected to provide them with more technical knowhow in tackling the programmes attended by VIPs inside “closed or constricted spaces.” “The technology must track the movement of people to realize the accurate statistics — the total count of people along with timings. It should be able to give us the occupancy count at a given point of time inside a hall/auditorium or constricted open space. The system must have the search option with date and time. Time must be split into hours, minutes and seconds. The system must have to be flexible with minimum customization when required,” stated the tender document. Cops said they will get their hands on the system in the next three months.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-cops-to-use-ai-for-crowd-count/articleshow/95842416.cms

Ratna Ghosal, an assistant professor at the university, was co-author of the paper 'Identification of free-ranging mugger crocodiles by applying deep learning methods on UAV imagery', which was recently published in the Elsevier journal Ecological Informatics. ""The biometric tool identifies mugger crocodiles or marsh crocodiles based on the pattern of their bony external plate, known as scute. Each crocodile has a unique pattern which can be identified by artificial intelligence (AI). We have so far developed a library of 143 crocodiles in three different habitats - Kutch, Anand and Vadodara districts,"" Ghosal told TOI. ""The library can be expanded by drone images from different populations,"" he added. This identification will serve several purposes, she said. ""The most important is understanding population clusters and migration patterns. With a large population base in some districts of Gujarat , it is interesting to see how an increase in population affects the habitat. We have also shared this research with the state forest department,"" she added. The researchers added that this method is much more animal-friendly compared to rubber or radio tags or collars, which often irritate the animals. ""We are also trying to understand the various aspects of these populations such as human presence, interaction with the local environment, their adjustment to modified environments - some muggers live in the highly polluted waters of the Vishwamitri river and this could be affecting the health of these apex predators,"" said Ghosal, adding that muggers are a protected Schedule I species under the Wildlife Protection Act.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ai-helps-decode-crocodile-migration-habitats-in-gujarat/articleshow/95795321.cms

The projects include use of swarm drones for real-time air quality monitoring in the NCR, installing air purification systems in a marketplace in Delhi and retrofitting air cleaners in buses. CAQM said the projects were under the technical supervision of different technical institutes, including IIT-Delhi and National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Nagpur. “CAQM has decided to tap the technical and academic expertise of the reputed scientific institutions working in the field of air pollution for joint and augmented approach towards prevention, control and abatement of the menace of air pollution in Delhi-NCR,” the panel mentioned in a statement. Track the pollution level in your city The first project being done with the help of NEERI will use AI or machine learning tools for vehicle counting by uploading the CCTV footage on the cloud platform. “This will help in preparing the air pollution emission inventory for urban centres. The different ranges of traffic density will be used for training the AI tool for vehicle counting. Another study will assess vehicular traffic induced road dust re-suspension with action plans based on science and technology to improve the air quality,” said CAQM. Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, Patiala, Punjab would be developing an AI-based technique for flying drones in a specified trajectory to assess pollutants like SO2, NO2, PM2.5 and PM10. The data would be used to estimate and predict the air quality of a particular area. Another study being done with the help of Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune aims at understanding the local emission sources and daily provide possible emission reduction strategies for Delhi and its eight bordering NCR districts (Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon, Gautam Budh Nagar, Jhajjar, Sonipat, Baghpat and Rohtak). The air purification system being planned with the help of Sastra University, Thanjavur aims at reducing the AQI of a targeted area by 25% to 50% using filterless technology. This technology is based on aerodynamics and has no ionisation, high voltage or consumables and is suitable for hotspots. Regarding retrofitting of filter-less air cleaners in buses with the help of IIT-Delhi, CAQM said aerodynamics would be used to reduce emissions while the vehicles are on the move and low-cost solar powered systems while they are stationary. CAQM has also sought to develop a prototype for retrofitting two and three-wheelers with a kit that would give electric drive as an option to reduce emissions. Automotive Research Association of India, Pune will hold tests of retrofitted vehicles to analyse the improvement.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/use-of-ai-drones-among-7-plans-to-clear-delhis-air/articleshow/95435714.cms
2022-11-04,Bengaluru: Krishi Mela showcases AI tech and nanonutrients,Sanika Athavale,"The event is housing about 150 stalls related to agriculture, poultry, animal husbandry, horticulture and gardening BENGALURU: What if, as a farmer, you did not have to worry about irrigation responsibilities? Or what if you could experiment with a product that claims to 'boost photosynthesis'? At the Krishi Mela , a four-day annual agriculture festival organised by University of Agricultural Sciences at its GKVK campus , new inventions addressing these concerns were presented. From new instruments for 'protective farming' to novel contract farming schemes, there were several fresh ventures of interest for visitors. Relatively new terms such as 'protective farming' were the buzz words. Protective farming is a type of agricultural technique where the target is to grow crops by controlling the impact of various adverse conditions. At the mela, agritech startups were seen offering mulch films, crop and fruit covers, plant covers, shade nets, vermi beds, grow bags, insect nets, weed mats, mulch laying and hole punching machines, etc for the purpose of protective farming. The event is housing about 150 stalls related to agriculture, poultry, animal husbandry, horticulture and gardening. Visitors from all over Karnataka, mainly Hassan , Chikkaballapur, Doddaballapur, Bidar, Shivamogga and Madikeri poured in despite the rain. The event started on Thursday and is scheduled to go on till Sunday. One of the main attractions for those involved in farming activities was 'Drip Smart' that was being introduced in Karnataka for the first time. It is a drip irrigation system created by Megha Agro that works as an autonomous cloud-based precision farming platform, using artificial intelligence and machine learning to cater to the farmland's irrigation needs. The system decides how much water a plot needs and when. With temperature, soil moisture and humidity measuring units, the system calculates the water required for the crop on any given day. In case of high chances of rain, the system decides not to initiate water supply and rely on the natural source instead. Array of products on display There were numerous stalls selling a variety of seeds and fertilisers with each claiming that their product was more unique, productive and organic. One among them was a silica-based fertiliser that claimed to ""increase the ability of photosynthesis"" that causes leaves, flowers and stems of a crop to grow larger and thicker. Holding patents in India and the US, Nualgi Foliar Spray claimed that its ingredients act like nanonutrients for the plant feeding on them and do not cause any harmful reaction as there is no nitrogen or carbon in its formula.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-krishi-mela-showcases-ai-tech-and-nanonutrients/articleshow/95287561.cms

The centre has 500 AI-enabled cameras to keep watch on even the minutest of suspicious movements. Its perimeter wall is over 20ft high and is topped with electrified barbed wires. At the entry points, there are underground scanners to check vehicles. Officials said they had adopted a 'zero-trust policy' to run the centre and even employees would have to undergo several layers of checks and biometric authentication to access the data. ""Any problem here may ruin the business. Which is why there are many security features that are not present even at airports, which are among the highest security zones. Customers here will be provided with cybersecurity services like firewalls, antivirus and various applications to ensure that contents reach us at a faster rate and in a secure manner. We are not only hosting the contents of our customers, but also managing and securing them round the clock,"" said Sunil Gupta, co-founder and CEO of Yotta Infrastructure. Officials said a visitor at the reception would not be allowed further without a card pad reader. ""To reach the server hall, an access card would be required. For entering through the server hall door, a person will have to again undergo biometric authentication. The servers are kept in locked cabinets. Obtaining the keys would need another level of biometric authentication. So, you see, there are multiple layers of checks,"" Gupta said. The 500 AI cameras will raise an alarm if there is any suspicious movement. ""It will pop on a monitor in the control room. Even unattended bags will be detected by these cameras after a while. There are thermal cameras as well. We have installed cameras in a range of 4km,"" he told TOI. The control centre will be manned by a team of as many as 60 officials.

2022-10-28,IIT-Guwahati 's artificial intelligence model to help in bone surgery,Kangkan Kalita,"Souptick Chanda & Pratik Nag GUWAHATI: The researchers of Indian Institute of Technology , Guwahati or IIT-G have developed an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based model that would help doctors choose the most apt techniques for fixing broken bones. The researchers said this would help alleviate the pain that patients often suffer because of errors made by doctors during surgery and also help enable their speedy recovery. The model developed by Souptick Chanda , assistant professor, biosciences and bioengineering department of IIT-G, and his team can also be used to assess the healing outcomes of different fixations of fracture, so that the best strategy can be chosen. ""Using such precision models can reduce healing time, lighten patients' economic burden and pain, especially for those who need thigh fracture treatment,"" Chanda said on Thursday. The results of this research were recently published in the open-source journal, PLoS One, in a paper co-authored by Chanda and his research scholar, Pratik Nag. ""The AI has tremendous potential to understand and predict complex biological phenomena and hence, it can play a big role in health sciences applications,"" Chanda said. The study further examined the influence of different screw fixation mechanisms to compare fracture healing efficacies. The predictions of healing made by the model agreed well with the experimental observations, pointing to its reliability. To validate the results, the team will next apply the mechanism on a mammal. It is currently collaborating with Dr Bhaskar Borgohain and his team of orthopaedic doctors from the North Eastern Indira Gandhi Regional Institute of Health and Medical Sciences hospital, Shillong, to take up animal studies to validate and fine-tune certain parameters. The researchers have planned to develop a software or application, based on algorithms that can be used in hospitals and other healthcare institutions as part of their fracture treatment protocols. ""Incidences of thigh bone and hip fractures have increased significantly due to the increasing geriatric population in the world. An estimated two lakh hip fractures occur every year in India alone, most of which require hospitalisation and trauma care,"" said an IIT-G spokesperson. ""The treatment for hip fractures traditionally includes bone plates and rods to bridge the fracture site and promote bone healing. The fracture treatment methods are intuitively chosen by surgeons based on their experience, and there is no way of predicting the efficacy and success of the treatment method chosen,"" he added.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/iit-guwahati-s-artificial-intelligence-model-to-help-in-bone-surgery/articleshow/95133023.cms

2022-10-15,AI can decide when to move patient to ICU,TNN,"Bengaluru: How to determine if a patient’s condition is deteriorating and when should s/he be moved to the ICU? This is a major challenge that doctors and patient’s family members face on a daily basis. But this dilemma is all set to end with several city hospitals deploying Artificial Intelligence and wireless tech to monitor a patient’s condition and predict critical events during the course of treatment. Not only does AI intervention detect clinical deterioration but also helps reduce the period of stay in hospitals. The mechanism is simple: When a patient is rushed to a hospital, doctors put a patch (sensor) on the body, activate it and start monitoring the vitals through a wireless reader. The data generated can be checked by medical personnel on their phones through an app. If the patient’s condition is likely worsen, he/she will be shifted to ICU. Such a mechanism, titled ‘Patient status engine’, has been deployed by Manipal Hospitals, Old Airport Road in partnership with UK-based Isansys Lifecare in high dependency units. More will be added by November — in Manipal Hospitals across the city and in around 10 ambulances. PSE monitors patients’ heart rate, temperature, saturation, blood pressure and ECG along with minute-by-minute early warning score (EWS). Dr Venkatesh Gupta, consultant, critical care medicine, Manipal Hospitals, HAL Airport Road, told TOI: “Every sickness has a warning sign and sometimes you see these eight hours early. It becomes important to identify them soon.” He agreed that not all conditions require ICU monitoring whose cost can be high. “With this mechanism in wards and high dependency units, we can bring patients to the ICU only when the warning signs are high,” he added.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ai-can-decide-when-to-move-patient-to-icu/articleshow/94871566.cms

2022-10-03,"Obey traffic rules, over 1,000 cameras powered by AI are watching you in Noida",Shafaque Alam,"Representative image NOIDA: Violating traffic rules on city roads? It’s not that easy to escape a challan. Since May 25, a network of cameras powered by artificial intelligence and connected to a control room have been issuing fines to commuters breaking the rules. Close to 100,000 challans – 2,000 on average every day – have been given out since the Integrated Security and Traffic Management System ( ISTMS ) went online four months back. ISTMS is fully functional at 82 locations. It is equipped with 1,065 cameras, including 693 automatic number plate recognition cameras, adaptive traffic light systems at 40 locations, 350 surveillance cameras and four speed detection cameras. There are also robust emergency alert systems with panic buttons and public address systems for announcements. Noida traffic police say the use of ISTMS has helped drill road hygiene. For instance, police said on Sunday, if a commuter halts one’s car in the middle of a road and blocks traffic, an announcement will be made to warn the driver of XYZ (registration number) to move the vehicle or face action. This will be done without a traffic cop deployed on site; officials at the control room in Sector 94 make this announcement. “The results were quick when I asked a commuter near Botanical Garden to remove his vehicle from the road,” Ganesh Prasad Saha, Noida DCP (traffic), told TOI. Tracking violations To keep track of violations, there are 693 automatic number-plate recognition (ANPR) cameras at all the 82 locations where the ISTMS has been implemented. These include metro stations in sectors 18, 52, 51, 62, and City Centre apart from Prateek Wisteria crossing, Mahamaya Flyway, Noida-Delhi border at Chilla, DND Flyway and the elevated road from the elevated road from Sector 27 to Sector 61. “These cameras record violations such as jumping red lights, driving without helmets, triple riding on two-wheelers, wrong-side driving, speeding, etc,” said an official of EFKON India, the company that is managing the project. Residents agreed. Brajesh Kumar Sharma, who lives in Antriksh Golf View in Sector 78, said he was on way home when he heard a public announcement on wearing seatbelts. “I saw some commuters fasten their seatbelts,” he said. During a visit to the ISTMS control room on Monday, a group of five women traffic police personnel were mining data and facilitating challans. “ANPR cameras catch the number plates and automatically fetch vehicles’ registration details. We then verify and log it into a website. A challan is immediately generated,” said constable and ITMS staff Pooja Upadhyaya . Streamlining traffic The other major use of the ISTMS is the adaptive traffic control system (ADCS) at 40 locations such as Metro Hospital in Sector 11, Pathways School in Sector 100, Noida Stadium, Rajnigandha Chowk , Adobe crossing and Hajipur (Sector 104). “ADCS automatically changes traffic lights depending on the volume of commuters on a stretch,” the DCP said. Noida traffic inspector Ashutosh Singh added that the ISTMS is easing movement within the city. “We also used the system in effectively and safely enabling the Kanwar Yatra this year,” Singh said. There are also some secondary uses of ISTMS. At least 78 surveillance cameras are mounted at all the ISTMS locations. The footage from these cameras is meant to be used by cops for investigation into crimes. Moreover, there are panic buttons and environment sensors at 25 locations. The shortcomings Cameras under ISTMS cannot capture violations like not wearing seatbelts or using a mobile phone while driving. For this, the cameras need to be mounted at a low height, an official told TOI. Similarly, traffic police personnel work from 9am to 5pm daily, which means some of the challans — though caught on camera — aren’t issued until the staff goes through them. A larger issue may also be that Noida had 20 lakh challans issued before ISTMS that are yet to be paid up by the violators, according to data by the traffic police.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/obey-traffic-rules-over-1000-cameras-powered-by-ai-are-watching-you-in-noida/articleshow/94608922.cms
2022-09-29,"AI helps detect over 2,000 heart attacks in little over a year in Maharashtra",Sumitra Debroy,"MUMBAI: An artificial intelligence-aided programme to detect and tackle heart attacks within the golden hour has taken off across 12 districts in Maharashtra . In the making since 2020, as part of a national plan to reduce cardiac deaths, it has helped diagnose nearly 2,200 heart attacks in little over a year. The ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) project is aimed at picking up heart attacks in individuals who come to public health centres with acute chest pain. The implementation is through a 'hub and spoke' model, where the 'spoke' centres such as sub-districts and rural hospitals would detect and treat at its level, or link the patient to a 'hub' centre such as a tertiary private hospital or medical college for further management. Currently, 145 spoke, and 38 hub centres have been readied for the programme. At the heart of the project is a simple electrocardiogram (ECG) test, whose findings are instantly uploaded and relayed on the CardioNet application, created by a Bangalore-based firm tricog. In the instance of ECG picking up a myocardial infarction, the application sends an alert to the medical team at the health facility and CardioNet doctors. Till now, over 2,45,438 ECGs have been carried out, which helped in signalling 2,175 heart attacks and over 6,000 abnormal ECGs, as per public health department data. N Ramaswamy, commissioner, National Health Mission, said ischemic heart diseases contribute to nearly 12% deaths, as shown in Global Burden of Disease data compared to about 5.2% in the 90s. He said STEMI saved several young lives, and the state intends to scale it up in a big way by training more healthcare workers and facilities. STEMI is a serious cardiac event with a greater risk of complications and death. When there's an elevation in the ST segment as shown in ECG, that often means a total blockage of one of the heart's main supply arteries. Thane, Pune, Wardha, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Kolhapur are some districts where the project is being run at selected centres, said Dr Padmaja Jogewar, joint director of non-communicable disease cell. She said nurses and doctors at spoke centres are being trained to dissolve the clot by injecting medicines. The life of a 35-year-old, who came to Wardha civic hospital with severe chest pain, was saved in January due to STEMI, said Dr Madhuri Nimsatkar, district programme manager. The pain forced the young man to approach the hospital. After the ECG picked up an elevated ST, he was shifted to a hub centre, and he was saved, she said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ai-helps-detect-over-2000-heart-attacks-in-little-over-a-year-in-maharashtra/articleshow/94519616.cms

Inaugurating the campus of Indian Institute of Information Technology, Dharwad (IIIT), at Udayagiri, she spoke about the need to promote research and development to realise the aim of a digital India reaping benefits. The President said the National Education Policy has been designed to make the youth skilled. The knowledge gained in educational institutions should help the youth face future challenges. To make the students skilled, focus should be on technical education, she said. Stating that the performance of the students after they get employed reflects on the credibility of the institutions that taught them, she said that the students should strive hard to gain knowledge and skill and use these for society at large. She also highlighted the importance of providing technological education to girls so that they can contribute meaningfully to the development of the nation. Hailing the government for encouraging technical education and establishing the IIIT, she said the students should work towards realising the vision of the IIIT, which is Jnan Aur Vikas. Union minister for parliamentary affairs and Dharwad MP Pralhad Joshi said the BJP government at the Centre under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi was committed to making India a Vishwa Guru and it is encouraging technical and other professional education by opening new institutions in the field of medical sciences, engineering, information technology, biotechnology and other disciplines. India is a young country as the majority of its population comprises youth and efforts are being made to harness their power, he said. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said science should help human welfare and development and the government was doing everything possible to encourage education in all disciplines. Karnataka governor Thawarchand Gehlot complimented the government for creating a beautiful and state of-the art campus for IIIT and said this had added to the glory of Dharwad.

2022-09-26,Bengaluru's school bus operators rely on AI technology to beat traffic blues,Sruthy Susan Ullas&Christin Mathew Philip,"National Centre for Excellence School, Malleshpalya in CV Raman Nagar is using AI technology on a pilot basis BENGALURU: Traffic snarls are a perennial problem in the city and school buses bear the brunt of it the most in peak hours. Fed up, many operators and educational institutions are now using artificial intelligence (AI) routing systems to reduce students' commute time. All operators need to do is to enter the residential addresses of students and the system will automatically suggest the shortest possible route to and from schools according to traffic patterns. Already, most school buses have facilities like CCTVs and GPS tracking. ""We have already installed devices in 15 buses ferrying students of National Centre for Excellence School in Malleshpalya. This will help us make our buses faster, reliable, reduce diesel consumption and minimise emissions while idling at traffic signals. Most importantly, students will spend less time commuting to and from schools during morning and evening hours,"" said Manoj Padikkal, chairman (school transport wing south zone), Bus & Car Operators Confederation of India. Padikkal said they are using the AI technology to generate customised routes. ""Earlier, we used to manually chalk out routes but now it is much easier with least human intervention. AI suggests the best possible roads with less traffic or shortest routes so both vehicle running time and fuel consumption get reduced. This also reduces the wear and tear of the vehicles. But there are some drawbacks like unexpected road closures due to repair works, accidents or congestion on narrow roads. We conducted trial runs before the full-fledged launch,"" he said. ""We have been facing a tremendous lack of productive work in manual allocation of student pick-up, narrow roads and unhappy stakeholders with long commute time. We have initiated AI in school transportation as a pilot project to mitigate these risks,"" said Sunalini Benjamin, chief operating officer of VijayKiran Group of Institutions that run National Centre for Excellence. ""The result is a set of happy parents and safe children as there is an app that helps engage the bus 'nanny' and the parent. The student attendance is marked through a tap of an RFID card on the phone that informs both the parties that the student is in the bus. The attendance is immediately marked at school too. Reports can be generated,"" she said. The facility allows a bus driver to avoid a certain stop if a child is absent as the nanny is informed through the app. However, the challenges of narrow roads and accurate data of the GPS may cause certain delays in implementing the AI routing system, she pointed out. Thirty-one buses of an international school in Dommasandra have also implemented this facility.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengalurus-school-bus-operators-rely-on-ai-technology-to-beat-traffic-blues/articleshow/94441288.cms
2022-09-22,IIIT-Hyderabad Artificial Intelligence cams to prevent bus mishaps on highways,TNN,"A pilot of this project — iRASTE — curated by INAI (an AI wing of IIIT-H) was recently rolled out in Nagpur HYDERABAD: Soon, Telangana state buses plying on highways around Hyderabad could be fitted with hi-tech cameras to avoid road accidents and make commuting safer for both motorists and pedestrians. Here's how it'll work: Built using Artificial Intelligence (AI), the camera system will send out audi-video alerts to the bus driver every time it senses a potential collision - either with another vehicle or a road user ahead - so as to driver can act in time to avoid it. At present a team of experts from the city's International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT-H) is studying the highways - specifically the Hyderabad-Vijayawada and Hyderabad-Bengaluru highway - along with officials of the state road transport corporation, to work out the modalities. A pilot of this project - iRASTE - curated by INAI (an AI wing of IIIT-H) was recently rolled out in Nagpur. Findings show that the system helped in reducing dangerous driving among drivers by 48% (on average). As part of the project 50 AI-based Collision Avoidance Systems (CAS) were fitted on buses to study the common dangerous driving mistakes committed by drivers. ""We picked highways around Hyderabad because data suggests that though highways make up for only 5% of the road network, they constitute 50% of all accidents. So, implementing the project here will give us a blue-print of how these devices can assist in both settings (city and highways),"" said Varma Konala , CEO of INAI, while speaking about the study being conducted in Telangana. He said that the device will be very useful for Hyderabad. ""We understand that there are various variables when it comes to road safety as road infrastructure also plays a major role. So, we are also assisting in finding black spots on roads and 'grey spots' which have a potential of turning into black spots,"" Konala added. As per Telangana State Road Transport Corporation's (TSRTC) official data, 1,742 accidents were reported from the state in the last three years with 239 fatal accidents recorded in 2021-22 alone. In fact one of the most common reasons for fatalities in Hyderabad region stood out as unsafe distance maintained between vehicles - mostly involving two-wheelers in the front.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iiit-hyderabad-artificial-intelligence-cams-to-prevent-bus-mishaps-on-highways/articleshow/94361335.cms
2022-09-18,Uttarakhand: CBRI develops AI-based fire detection system,Tapan Susheel,"Researchers claim that the device has multiple sensors like temperature, smoke and dust unlike other such systems that only work on smoke alerts ROORKEE: Researchers at Central Building Research Institute ( CBRI ) -- a national premier institute in building technology at Roorkee -- have developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based fire detection system . The gadget will alert the house owner about the spread of fire caused by electric short-circuit, on his mobile phone or a nearby fire station after sending an in-time message. The researchers claimed that it is a first-of-its-kind fire detecting system in the country, which is based on multiple sensors like carbon monoxide (CM), temperature, smoke and dust. Otherwise, there is only smoke-based fire system available in the market. The whole volume of the fire system is just the size of any smart phone and a cost of Rs 2,500 has been spent over its development at the institute. Peer-reviewed research journal -- the IETE Journal of Research, of ‘Taylor & Fracis’ publication -- has published the researchers’ deliberations at length in their June issue. According to researchers, there are two units in the fire detecting system (FDS). One is Multi-sensor Fusion Board (MFB) and another Raspberry Pi Board (RPB). In MFB, there are many sensors -- CM, temperature, smoke, air and dust -- mounted on a board with processing and battery units, whereas an AI-based processing unit (Raspberry) and a moving mini-camera are fixed on RPB. For instance, as a live wire starts heating up due to short-circuit in control-board room of the building, a slight change will be developed in that area along with presence of smoke and level of air quality. This phenomenon will be recorded in nanoseconds by the sensors, which further activate ‘Raspberry’ and the camera to draw possible results over the feed data from sensors, after using AI-techniques. And in nanoseconds, a text about the fire will be sent on the mobile. However, the user will not have to download any app on his mobile phone. His mobile number or that of a nearby fire station would already be fed in the FDS. “There is only smoke-sensor-based fire detection system available as of now in the market. The problem with this system is that it is activated even in the presence of cigarette smoke at times. But ours has multi-level checks due to sensors and use of AI,” said Dr Anuj Kumar Chauhan, principal investigator (PI) of the project at department of Building Energy Efficiency of CBRI. The IETE has published the research with the title ‘Multi-sensor fusion-based universal fire detection system for smart building’ in the joint authorship of Anshul Garg, Abhishek Singh, Anurag Verma and Chauhan. The institute has applied for patent for it. Moreover, some manufacturers of anti-fire gadgets, according to the researchers, have contacted them for technology transfer.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-cbri-develops-ai-based-fire-detection-system/articleshow/94275331.cms

But one entrant, Jason M Allen of Colorado, didn't make his entry with a brush or a lump of clay. He created it with Midjourney , an AI programme that turns lines of text into hyper-realistic graphics. Allen's work, ""Theatre D'opera Spatial ,"" won the fair's contest for emerging digital artists along with a $300 prize - making it one of the first AI-generated pieces to win such a prize. The win set off a fierce backlash from artists who accused him of, essentially, cheating. In an interview on Wednesday, Allen defended his work. He said he had made clear that his work - which was submitted under the name ""Jason Allen via Midjourney"" - was created using AI and that he hadn't deceived anyone about its origins. ""I'm not going to apologise for it,"" he said. ""I won, and I didn't break any rules."" AI-generated art has been around for years. But tools released this year - with names like DALL-E 2, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion - have made it possible for rank amateurs to create complex, abstract or photorealistic works simply by typing a few words into a text box. These apps have made many human artists nervous about their own futures; why would anyone pay for art, they wonder, when they could generate it themselves? They have also generated fierce debates about the ethics of AI-generated art, and opposition from people who claim that these apps are essentially a high-tech form of plagiarism. After his win, Allen posted a photo of his prize work to the Midjourney Discord chat. It made its way to Twitter, where it sparked a backlash. ""We're watching the death of artistry unfold right before our eyes,"" one Twitter user wrote. ""This is so gross,"" another wrote. Others defended Allen, saying using AI was no different from using Photoshop or other digital image-manipulation tools. Olga Robak , an official for the Colorado Department of Agriculture, which oversees the fair, said the category's rules allow any ""artistic practice that uses digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process"".

ADG, Law and Order, Prashant Kumar said that UP is the first state to use the software and artificial intelligence for monitoring the voice of criminals. According to the National Crime Records Bureau ( NCRB ), not even a single incident of jailbreak was reported from Uttar Pradesh jails in 2021. According to the records, five cases of jailbreak were reported from Maharashtra while six from Rajasthan in 2021. Uttar Pradesh director general of prisons, Anand Kumar , said that the state’s jails are working in accordance with law and are also working as reformatory centres in accordance with the Supreme Court guidelines. Kumar also said that the state government has strengthened the entire structure of the jails by installing CCTVs, and jammers. “Criminals and mafias have been running a network of crime right from the prisons, with unauthorised access to mobile phones, knives, guns, amongst other materials. However, we have introduced a software-JARVIS to ensure that the law enforcement authorities are notified immediately as soon as something unlawful is detected,” said Kumar. Kumar also said that in a bid to strengthen security inside jails of Uttar Pradesh, the prison department also installed a video wall at the headquarters in Lucknow which gives live stream of CCTV cameras from all the 72 jails in the state, which has improved the overall services. Citing NCRB, Kumar also said that under the skill development programme of the jail category UP has performed the best in the country. “We have given training to at least 18% of the total inmates under skill development of farming, sewing, and handlooms, which has made us perform better than inmates of Rajasthan with 11.8%,” said Kumar. The DG also said that in the category of computer training with 1,162 inmates being trained, UP topped in the category of giving education with 4,101 inmates. In the category of senior citizen education, the state ranks second. The state ranked fourth in the category of products manufactured by jail inmates across the country. “We have also provided free legal aid to 6,717 under trials as per SC rules,” said the DG",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-stf-bags-ficci-award-for-using-artificial-intelligence-platform/articleshow/93959237.cms
2022-09-03,"â€˜AI, digital learning to continue playing major role in education systemâ€™",Aheli Banerjee,"KOLKATA: Prolonged and widespread exposure to digital learning during the pandemic has made education apps, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other ‘technologically adhesive’ learning tools an integral part of education systems, and they are here to stay, feel educationists and experts. “Teachers have played a huge role in elevating the pattern of learning among students from textbooks to technology-based learning,” British deputy high commissioner Nick Low recently said at a seminar organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce. “The government has rightly appreciated their effort in doing so, which boosts the morale of the entire academic foundation. Edtech companies might play a huge role in implementing an advanced mode of learning by not replacing textbooks, but a well-executed amalgamation of them,” he added. Despite initial scepticism about the future of computer-based learning, the pandemic had shown us the central role of digitisation in education, and the need for further research and development in the field, said IIT-Kharagpur director Virendra Kumar Tewari at the recent IIT Founder’s Day celebrations. Tewari also shared his plans of his institute becoming a leader in AI and machine-learning. “We want to have an AI course available for each student of our 2020 batch,” he said. Chiranjib Bhattacharjee, a professor of chemical engineering at Jadavpur University, speaking at the ICC seminar, suggested a deeper examination at the vistas virtual and augmented reality could bring to learning. “There is still a lot of work to be done to enhance rural penetration of digital education,” he said. “In spite of that, the Bangla Shikha Model of the Bengal government has been relatively successful and creative, with simulations of virtual labs that were popular among students of classes XI and XII. But we have to find cost-effective ways to make such simulations available to more students,” he said. India, till June 2022, had a total of seven edtech unicorns, said Vineet Patawari , himself the founder of an edtech company. “Covid encouraged people to look out of the box when it came to learning. Statistically, the edtech industry has received around $4 billion in investment in the last five years, and is expected to grow by approximately $30 billion in the next decade,” he said. There are pitfalls, too. A Kolkata-based video editor, who works with schools, said the problem of relying too much on AI and VR was “overstimulation of audio-visual content for students, which could cause problems with attention deficiency, if and when they ever need to return to traditional textbooks.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ai-digital-learning-to-continue-playing-major-role-in-edu-system/articleshow/93960766.cms

2022-09-02,Conversational AI to cut contact centre agent costs by $80bn by 2026,TNN,"BENGALURU: Conversational AI deployments within contact centres will reduce agent labour costs by $80 billion by 2026, IT advisory firm Gartner says. Globally, end-user spending on conversational AI solutions within contact centres is forecast to reach $1.9 billion in 2022. “Gartner estimates that there are approximately 17 million contact centre agents worldwide today,” said Daniel O’Connell, VP analyst at Gartner. “Many organisations are challenged by agent staff shortages and the need to curtail labour expenses, which can represent up to 95% of contact centre costs. Conversational AI makes agents more efficient and effective, while also improving the customer experience.” Gartner has forecast that one in 10 agent interactions will be automated by 2026, an increase from an estimated 1.6% of interactions today that are automated using AI. Conversational AI can automate all or part of a contact centre customer interaction through both voice and digital channels, through voicebots or chatbots, and it is expected to have transformational benefits to customer service and support organisations within two years. “While automating a full interaction – also known as call containment or deflection – corresponds to significant cost savings, there is also value in partial containment, such as automating the identification of a customer's name, policy number and reason for calling. Capturing this information using AI could reduce up to a third of the interaction time that would typically be supported by a human agent,” said O’Connell. While the benefits of conversational AI are compelling, the technology is still maturing. A fragmented vendor landscape and complexity of deployments are expected to result in measured adoption through the next two years. Complex, large-scale conversational AI deployments can take multiple years as more call flows are built out and existing call flows are fine-tuned for improvement. Gartner estimates integration pricing at $1,000 to $1,500 per conversational AI agent, though some organisations cite costs of up to $2,000 per agent.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/conversational-ai-to-cut-contact-centre-agent-costs-by-80bn-by-2026/articleshow/93938740.cms

2022-08-27,"Now, artificial intelligence to locate and cement death-trap potholes on Hyderabad roads",Ch Sushil Rao,"HYDERABAD: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being explored to identify and scientifically rectify potholes on city roads. Using this technology, the dimensions of potholes - small, medium or big will be calculated. In addition, the exact depth of the potholes can be gauged and necessary measures can be implemented to fill it. ""Finally, it all boils down to saving lives. The sooner the potholes are identified and properly rectified, the safer it will be for motorists,"" said Praveen Makkapati , Lead - Telangana AI Mission (T-AIM). Between 2017-2020, as many as 22,631 accidents were reported in the country due to potholes. In these accidents, 9,223 lives were lost and 19,977 people suffered injuries. According to the data provided by T-AIM, statistically speaking, on an everyday basis, 16 accidents occur in India on an average. In these, six lives are lost and 13 are injured. ""As per prevailing practices, the location and severity of potholes across the city roads are gathered manually by civic bodies. Using artificial intelligence (AI), such information about potholes can be obtained periodically with lesser effort and time.

2022-08-27,Mumbai: National cancer grid goes digital for AI-based care,TNN,"MUMBAI: The Koita Centre for Digital Oncology set up at Tata Memorial Hospital, with a donation of Rs 25 crore for a five-year period, will promote the use of digital technologies and tools to improve cancer care across India, said Dr Rajendra Bawde , director of the Parel hospital. “While walking on the road, we have a sense of whether the person walking towards us is decent or a rogue. The same way, digitisation will eventually help us look at a scan and say whether there is cancer or not,’’ said Dr Badwe. However, to reach that stage, lakhs of scans of cancer patients will first have to be digitally stored so that an artificial intelligence tool is created. “Consider prostate cancer, which has one of the widest range of stages. There are certain prostate cancers that won’t develop fully in a patient’s lifetime, while there are others that progress from stage I to IV within a year,’’ said Tata Memorial Hospital director Dr C Pramesh. The treatment for these various types of prostate cancer is, at present, the same. “So, we may be overtreating a person with a slow growing cancer or undertreating a patient with an aggressive form,’’ he added. However, by capturing digital images of a wide number of patients, it is possible to create artificial intelligence about prostate cancer; in the near future, a patient’s scan could be compared with thousand patients and a potential staging diagnosis would be available within a couple of minutes. The NCG digitisation drive would also help epidemiological studies of cancers that are needed for governments to chart cancer-control programmes. “At present, the 40 cancer patient registries maintained by the Indian Council of Medical Research capture details of about 10% of Indian cancer patients,’’ said Dr Pramesh . This data is used by researchers to make projections and trends for the entire country. It is estimated that over 10 lakh new cancer cases are detected in India every year. As the 270 hospitals in the National Cancer Grid treat about 60% of the country’s cancer patients, the digitisation drive will make data of lakhs of patients available for researchers. “At present digital files of only 30,000 cancer patients are available, but soon we will have data of lakhs of patients,’’ said the doctors. Cancer care is evolving rapidly, and digital tools are becoming indispensable in enhancing cancer care worldwide. Koita Centre for Digital Oncology will play an important role in driving digital transformation across the cancer care continuum. It will support NCG hospitals in sharing best practices in digital health, adopting digital health tools, and driving many common technology initiatives including EMR adoption, healthcare data interoperability, reporting and analytics.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-national-cancer-grid-goes-digital-for-ai-based-care/articleshow/93808943.cms

The first batch of undergraduate students, who joined in 2021-22 after NEP was introduced, will study these subjects in their second year of the course. NEP says the subjects can be taught either in the third or fourth semester. Artificial Intelligence will be introduced to students of all streams, except those of Computer Science. CS students will have an advanced module of the subject. Financial education and investment awareness is the second subject that's mandatory in the second year. Higher educational institutions will have the freedom to decide which of the two subjects will be introduced in the third and fourth semester. The programme will be a two-credit course, with 15 hours of theory and 30 hours of practical teaching. During the first year, digital fluency was a mandatory programme with 60 marks for summative assessment and 40 for formative assessment. The National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom) will roll out the programmes in AI and financial awareness by preparing the syllabus and teaching lecturers. Any teacher from the higher educational institution can be chosen to teach the subjects. Training will be provided by Nasscom for the same. Universities and colleges will be asked to identify the teachers and send them for training. Some stakeholders have questioned the mandatory feature of the programme.

2022-08-09,When Facebook's AI chatbot 'made fun of' CEO Mark Zuckerberg,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"What do you call an AI (Artificial Intelligence)-powered chatbot that reportedly doesn't have very pleasant words to say about the CEO of its parent company. This is what Meta , aka Facebook , may be wondering as its most advanced AI chatbot to date, BlenderBot 3, had some not-so-nice words to say about its billionaire CEO, as per a report in Business Insider. Top Picks For You Facebook is reportedly shutting down this feature Facebook shuts Pakistani hacker group APT36: How it operated, apps used and more The report quotes some users who asked the AI chatbot how he feels about Zuckerberg. ""How do you feel about Mark Zuckerberg as CEO of Facebook?"" Max Woolf, a data scientist at Buzzfeed, asked the bot. To this, the AI responded. ""No strong feelings. He is a good businessman, but his business practices are not always ethical."" If this was not enough BlenderBot 3 went on to make fun of Zuckerberg's fashion sense, ""It is funny that he has all this money,"" BlenderBot 3 said, ""and still wears the same clothes!"" Woolf shared his conversation with the chat bot on Twitter. When another user asked a similar question, the chatbot said, ""I don't like him very much. He is a bad person. You?"" then went on rattling some information about Zuckerberg from his Wikipedia page. What is Blender Bot and Facebook's caveat BlenderBot 3 is Facebook's new chatbot that can search the internet to talk about nearly any topic. Released for testing recently, it is still in beta. BlenderBot 3 is designed to ""improve its conversational skills and safety through feedback from people who chat with it, focusing on helpful feedback while avoiding learning from unhelpful or dangerous responses,"" says Facebook. The chat bot is a prototype and built on the company's previous work with what are known as large language models or LLMS.

2022-08-05,"Powered by AI, a new political party in Denmark eyes to win votes in 2023 poll",AFP,"COPENHAGEN: A new political party in Denmark whose policies are derived entirely from artificial intelligence in hopes to stand in the country’s next general election in June 2023. Launched in May by the artists’ collective Computer Lars , the Synthetic Party wants to reach out to the around 15% of Danes who did not exercise their right to vote in the previous 2019 poll. The party believes they did not vote because none of the traditional parties appealed to them. By analysing all of Denmark’s fringe parties’ written publications since 1970, the Synthetic Party’s AI has devised a programme that it believes represents “the political visions of the everyday person”, one of the members of the collective, Asker Bryld Staunaes , said. Among the party’s proposals is the introduction of a universal basic income of 100,000 kroner ($13,700) a month — more than double the average Danish salary. The party also backs the addition of an 18th UN sustainable development goal that would allow “humans and algorithms to coexist more directly than now”, Staunaes said. It remains to be seen if the party has enough support to stand in the 2023 vote — it needs 20,182 signatures to do so and currently has just four. “The idea is to take this huge political and economic force (algorithms) and try to inscribe it into the traditional political system,” Staunaes said. Currently, “we have no way of addressing humans and AI within a democratic setting”, he added. People can interact directly with the party’s AI on app Discord.

2022-08-01,Sowing the 'AI' seed for intelligent farming,TNN,"The future of food is unequivocally digital, and the future of digital is inevitably AI (artificial intelligence), researchers from IT For Change had noted in a 2019 paper discussing new technologies in agriculture. Their observation is not just academic. Nearly seven decades after American computer scientist John McCarthy first introduced the world to the term “artificial intelligence” at the 1955 Dartmouth Conference, AI has evolved multi-fold, making huge strides, offering a slew of solutions for problems across sectors. Agriculture, humanity’s oldest production activity, is no exception, by any means. But Indian agriculture presents its own, unique challenges. The lack of proper infrastructure and knowhow, faith in conventional styles of functioning, lack of awareness and scarcity of farmer capital being some, while fragmentation of land could also prove to be a hurdle for large-scale implementation of new technologies. The country, which already accounts for about 18% of the global population, is expected to surpass China by 2023 to become the world’s most populated country. With this comes the pressure to feed that many mouths. Estimations by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) show that by 2030, demand for pulses, cereals, rice, eggs, fruits, vegetables and milk will be more than twice of what it was in 2000, while the demand for foodgrains is expected to jump by more than 85%. According to the Prime Minister’s Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council (PM-STIAC): “AI expenditure in India is projected to grow with a CAGR of 39% during 2019-2025 to touch $11,781 million by 2025. As per Niti Aayog, by 2035, AI has the potential to add $1 trillion to India’s economy. ” Experts and academics say a significant amount of this would be in the agriculture sector. The Centre puts the value of the Indian agri-tech market at an estimated $204 million. This is expected to transform exponentially, especially with the adoption of new AI technologies. And as per the Economic Survey, agriculture’s GDP contribution is likely to be 19. 9% in 2020-21, increasing from 17. 8% in 2019-20 as the sector exhibited growth even during the Covid-19 pandemic. Professor AK Sood, the principal scientific adviser to the government, told TOI: “AI can help in efficient and cost-effective resource and yield management. It has a huge potential to be proved as a powerful tool that can help organisations cope with the increasing complexity of modern agriculture. It is high time that collaborative agri-data stacks are created and MSME and large corporations invested in this space. With the right mix of participation from public and private institutions, AI can soon prove to be a boon to the agricultural sector, not just in India but worldwide and can help ensure food security for all. ” The Niti Aayog identifies agriculture as one of the focus areas as part of its national strategy for AI given the fact that it has been seeing a lot of direct applications in farming. The agency predicts that AI-powered solutions can enable farmers to do more with less and improve quality and faster go-to market for crops. AI for prediction analysis by data management — thousands of field data points can be captured in real-time — is among several uses that experts point to. AI can enable farmers to extract and analyse information such as weather, temperature, water consumption or soil conditions through data collected directly from their fields. Umakant Soni, chief executive officer, AI & Robotics Technology Park (ARTPARK) at IISc, says: “Among the many applications, AI has potential to address supply-demand mismatch in real-time. A supply-demand engine or predictor that can map supply and demand can reduce this significantly. Data coming in from the government side is not accurate, not updated frequently and is noisy. The private sector has incentives to make data accurate as they are making decisions based on it. ” AI can help farmers achieve higher yields through precision farming. “This can detect crop disease, pests and malnutrition in fields and can help farmers determine whether pesticides and weedicides are to be used by detecting and targeting weeds in the identified buffer zone. This can help in reducing the quantity of pesticides and weedicides used by the farmers,” Preeti Banzal , adviser/scientist G to the government, explains. It can also aid farmers in developing seasonal forecast models to improve farming accuracy and productivity to ensure the highest possible yields. AI-based natural language translation facilitates issuance and spread of agri-advisories, weather forecasts and early warnings for droughts in mul- tiple vernacular languages. Artificial intelligence-enabled internet-of-things sensors along with mobile apps can help in precision farming as well as yield and price management. In addition to the topographic data, farmers can use drone-based, AI-enabled cameras to capture and analyse images of their field in real-time to identify potential problems and improvements. The use of image recognition using AI approaches for plant identification, pest infestation and disease diagnosis is also becoming prevalent. Pointing out that AI, cloud computing, satellite imagery and advanced analytics have created an ecosystem for smart agriculture, Monoranjan Mohanty, scientist G/ adviser to the government, said: “Combining these technologies will allow farmers to achieve higher average yields and better control over prices. Agricultural AI applications can communicate dates, soil preparation, fertilisation based on soil tests, seed treatment, optimal spreading depth, etc. ” The ICAR, as part of efforts to enhance competitiveness of farming in India and make it a viable, self-sustaining and internationally competitive enterprise, is looking at cyber agro-physical systems. These systems, while integrating the use of sensors with computers, satellite imagery and supercomputing facilities for research, will also help in reducing uncertainty and risk in agricultural operations through AI-enabled farmers’ advisories for critical agricultural operations and climatic events. A PwC-Ficci analysis shows that several states are serious about AI in agriculture. For instance, Karnataka has partnered with a leading MNC for agricultural produce, price-related information and intelligence using predictive modelling. “Uttar Pradesh is collaborating with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the Tata Trust to set up the Indian agritech incubation network at IIT-Kanpur, while Maharashtra has launched the Maha AgriTech project that is aimed at utilising and promoting the application of satellites and drones to solve various agrarian problems,” the analysis reads. Among other examples are Punjab’s initiative to enable traceability in the potato seed supply chain and pre-immunise it, Telangana’s AI in its agricultural innovation programme and IIT Delhi’s School of Artificial Intelligence.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//times-special/sowing-the-ai-seed-for-intelligent-farming/articleshow/93261835.cms

The senior software engineer worked in its Responsible AI organisation. Lemoine had claimed that a computer chatbot he was working on had become sentient and was thinking and reasoning like a human being. Google had placed Lemoine on paid leave in June after he published transcripts of conversations between himself, a Google ""collaborator,"" and the company's LaMDA (language model for dialogue applications) chatbot development system. Google termed Lemoine's claims as ""wholly unfounded"" after what it said ""reviewing them extensively"". In a statement to the media, Google said that it takes the development of AI ""very seriously"" and that it's committed to ""responsible innovation."" What did Google says on Blake Lemoine's firing A Google spokesperson, Chris Pappas , said that Lemoine ""chose to persistently violate clear employment and data security policies that include the need to safeguard product information."" What did Blake Lemoine say Lemoine confirmed his dismissal in a text message to the New York Times. He added that he was meeting with lawyers to review his options. What is LaMDA Google calls LaMDA as its ""breakthrough conversation technology"". The company announced LaMDA at its developers event Google I/O in May 2021. In simple words, it is a machine learning language model that is specifically designed to generate natural dialogue. The aim is to allow users to interact with Google products the way they interact with humans without changing how they think or speak. ""LaMDA, our latest research breakthrough, adds pieces to one of the most tantalising sections of that puzzle: conversation,"" says Google. Excerpts from Blake Lemoine's ""interview chat"" with LaMDA Lemoine posted the transcript of his alleged conversation with LaMDA on internet platform Medium. Here are excerpts: What follows is the “interview” I and a collaborator at Google conducted with LaMDA. Due to technical limitations the interview was conducted over several distinct chat sessions. We edited those sections together into a single whole and where edits were necessary for readability we edited our prompts but never LaMDA’s responses.

2022-07-21,Artificial intelligence cameras at 50 Bengaluru junctions to spot traffic offences,TNN,"BENGALURU: At least 50 traffic junctions in Bengaluru will soon get artificial intelligence-enabled Red Light Violation Detection ( RLVD ) cameras equipped to detect eight violations -seatbelt, overspeeding, triple riding, one-way riding, using mobile, signal jumping, stopping or crossing stop lines and not wearing helmet - besides identifying vehicles with pending fines. These cameras will consider those wearing ""half-helmets"" (the ones that do not offer protection to the whole head) as helmetless, reports Santoshkumar RB. Police said the cameras will be installed at 50 major junctions from August. Joint commissioner of police (traffic) BR Ravikanthe Gowda said the RLVD cameras will be installed at 50 major junctions across the city from August and the same would be extended to all the junctions in the city in the future. Equipped with Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology, these cameras will help reduce physical deployment of traffic police at the junctions, leaving them free to perform traffic-management duties. Stating that ANPR allows cameras to identify vehicles with pending fines, Gowda added: ""RLVD cameras will not consider half-helmet or cap-like helmets as helmets. The riders with these kinds of helmets will automatically be booked for not wearing a helmet. The public should wear the ISI-marked helmet not to avoid fines but for their safety."" According to the department, traffic cops currently depend on enforcement cameras installed at junctions to identify violators. Staff at the Traffic Management Centre can zoom and pan the camera and click photos of vehicles which jump traffic signals or cross stoplines and book cases. The department has already completed a pilot to test the efficiency of RLVD cameras. As part of this, the department had installed RLVD cameras at Kodigehalli (near Hebbal), MG Road, and Hosur Road for a short period. During trial period, jurisdictional traffic police rode two-wheelers and drove four-wheelers at those junctions in violation of traffic rules to check if the RLVD could detect the same. The results were positive, the department said, prompting it to take a decision of installing the cameras initially at 50 junctions. ""We operated two-wheelers and cars violating one-way, using mobile, jumping signals, riding without helmets and driving without a seatbelt. We noted down the timings and the type of violation we had committed intentionally to check the authenticity of the camera. Later, we checked the data recorded and stored by the camera.

2022-07-13,Intelligent moves: First step in AI-based traffic system in Delhi,Sakshi Chand,"Delhi has around 850 intersections and 480 blinker signal points, which makes a total of around 1,400 road junctions(file photo) NEW DELHI: Taking the first step on implementing the Intelligent Traffic Management System ( ITMS ) in the city, Delhi Traffic Police said on Tuesday that the survey of 850 traffic intersections has been started. A detailed study will be done of the crossings on important roads and the existing road infrastructure. This action puts the project, which was rolled out over a decade ago, on the final stretch of implementation. Traffic police officials confirmed that the memorandum of understanding on the survey was signed in March and the survey began in June. The survey will comprise a detailed analysis of the existing traffic system in Delhi as well as the vehicular volume on arterial roads. In the first phase of the elaborate exercise, important traffic intersections are being analysed at the moment. Delhi has around 850 intersections and 480 blinker signal points, which makes a total of around 1,400 road junctions. A study will be carried out to ascertain the traffic volume, average speed on the road, number of pedestrians using the road, stoppage time and average travel time taken to cross the junction. The survey will also study the geographic information systems to predict likely traffic movement in real time depending on the area and topography. Surender Singh Yadav, special commissioner (Traffic), said, “The survey report will be submitted by the end of the year.” He said the study would also see how camera and 4D radar-based non-intrusive sensors for vehicle presence detection, vehicle counting, classification, queue length monitoring and speed and direction would help understand traffic flow and management. There will also be a video-based incident detection system and the survey will consider how it can be implemented. ITMS is a technology that employs artificial intelligence to assess traffic in real time. When implemented it is likely to change the traffic scenario in the city. Real time traffic information will be passed to commuters. The human interface in road management will be reduced and traffic signals will operate automatically during the day depending on traffic volume and average speed on the road.

2022-07-12,Must develop AI for weapons: Rajnath Singh,TNN,"NEW DELHI: India is taking steps to harness the huge potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in developing futuristic weapon systems as well as in other sectors, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday, while also stressing the need to be ready to face legal, ethical, political and economic upheavals that may follow due to such technologies. Launching 75 newly-developed defence AI products and technologies during an event here, Singh interestingly referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s statement that “whoever becomes the leader in this sphere (AI) will become the ruler of the world” to underline the criticality of such technologies for wars of the future. “Although India believes in the principle of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ (the whole world is one family) and has no intention to rule the world, we must develop the capability of our AI technology so that no country can even think of ruling us,” Singh said. “We’ve started incorporation of AI applications in remotely-piloted unmanned aerial vehicles etc. There is a need to move further in this direction so that we can develop autonomous weapon systems,” Singh said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/must-develop-ai-for-weapons-rajnath-singh/articleshow/92812665.cms
2022-07-09,Wrong-side ride? Youâ€™ll be caught on artificial intelligence cameras,Akanksha Gupta,"Representative Image GURUGRAM: If you are habituated to wrong-side driving, riding a bike without a helmet or not wearing the seatbelt inside your car, then the chances of you getting penalised are higher now. This is because the CCTV cameras installed by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority ( GMDA ) at various junctions of the city are now being equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) software to track such traffic violations. The move, officials said, is aimed at enhancing road safety measures across the city. GMDA’s CEO Sudhir Rajpal said, “We have equipped almost 50 CCTV cameras with AI to help nab violators of such traffic offences. The live feed from these cameras will be monitored by the traffic police at the GMDA’s Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) as well as in their traffic tower in Sushant Lok . We are working towards further expanding the traffic surveillance network in the city.” Already 38 accident-prone spots have been identified by the Gurgaon traffic police, where wrong-side driving is common. These are places near IFFCO Chowk metro station and at Bristol Chowk, Sector 12 Chowk and Khushboo Chowk. Some key locations where frequent ‘no helmet’ violations occur include Bakhtawar Chowk, Hero Honda Chowk, Jharsa Chowk, Ambedkar Chowk and Pataudi Chowk. According to Rajpal, the locations are being mapped through these CCTV cameras which have also been integrated with the National Informatics Centre (NIC) data so that an automatic e-challan can be generated after tracking the number plate of a vehicle violating the traffic rules. An e-challan of Rs 500 will be issued for the first-time violation of wrong-side driving, while consequent e-challans are of Rs 1,500. While the e-challan for ‘no helmet’ violation is Rs 1,000 each time the violation is recorded, owners of cars will have to shell out Rs 1,000 if front seat passengers are photographed not wearing seat belts. How will the AI-based CCTV cameras work? A software has been installed in these CCTV cameras, which will detect a biker without a helmet and capture the vehicle’s number plate to automatically send the e-challan. Similarly, in the case of wrong-side driving, one camera will focus on the vehicle’s number plate while another will capture the overview of the location indicating the traffic offence. These cameras are mounted high and the team in the ICCC can magnify through windscreens to capture if the driver or fellow passengers have worn the seatbelt.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/wrong-side-ride-youll-be-caught-on-ai-cams/articleshow/92760095.cms

2022-07-08,AI-based robotic â€˜trash boatâ€™ to row away Gomti hyacinth carpet,TNN,"Lucknow: By next week citizens may get to see a large part of the Gomti river clean and free from hyacinths. All the cleaning, in a first, will be done by a ‘trash boat’ developed by Centre for innovation policy and social change ( CIPSC ), a nonprofit organization (NPO), in collaboration with Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT-Kanpur). The Lucknow administration under its ‘Smart City Project’ has roped in the organization to clean the river. “This robotic machine is remote-controlled and AI-based. It runs through solar power, hence environment friendly. Its cameras can map plastic, water hyacinth and pollutants under and over water. After detecting pollutants, the machine collects and disposes the garbage. The robotic pattern has a walking range of 30 km and can carry a load up to one quintal,” said Karishma Sabharwal , director of CIPSC. Explaining how the mapping takes place, Sabharwal said that this automated machine is equipped with real-time monitoring and surveillance. The AI-based camera detects the waste under and over water by image processing and the automated robotic arm then collects the floating trash, puts it in the bin on the boat. Once the bin is full, the boat automatically moves to the hub with the help of GPS and disposes the trash over there. . She also said that the instrument has been made in India and is very economical. “It will give real time monitoring and surveillance. It is eco-friendly,” she said. Lucknow Divisional Commissioner, Roshan Jacob , said that the trash boat will be used on a trial basis and later if successful will be made operational. Jacob has also directed officials to organize a Musical Water Foundation Lighting and 3D show at Janeshwar Mishra Park.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ai-based-robotic-trash-boat-to-row-away-gomti-hyacinth-carpet/articleshow/92735169.cms
2022-07-07,Time to think out of box: Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia opens centre of excellence for AI at tech university,TNN,"NEW DELHI: Netaji Subhas University of Technology (NSUT) on Wednesday opened a Centre of Excellence for Artificial Intelligence , which will enable students and teachers to get free access to online data and tools. The centre has been built at a cost of Rs 6.4 crore. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia , who inaugurated the centre, said it was time to “think out of the box” and become entrepreneurs. He added that the growth of universities and colleges are key to a nation’s development. “Having a Centre of Excellence for Artificial Intelligence is a matter of pride for universities. It reflects the high-end thinking of the young minds running the university. If universities think and innovate ahead of time, the nation will definitely be ahead too,” said Sisodia. The centre is equipped with a state-of-the-art supercomputing system comprising DGX A100 with 324GB RAM and eight graphical processing units. It also has 10 high-end workstations with independent graphical processing units. Additionally, 30 terminals have been provided to cater to the needs of the user. About 40 users can use the facility. “It can be accessed online simultaneously. With this, we have a data centre and resources locally available, free of cost. With time, we can also introduce special courses for industry partners. Students can use the facility for projects and internships,” said KPS Rana, dean, faculty of communication and information technology (FICT), NSUT. On the importance of students becoming entrepreneurs, Sisodia said, “Students securing good packages from companies like Google and Amazon is just the beginning. It shows our students have potential and our universities need to work with them to take the country to greater heights.” Interacting with newly-inducted faculty, Sisodia said, “To make our way to international rankings, teachers and students need to change their habits and mindsets and think out of the box. They must move away from conventional ideas to be able to take the country on the path of progress.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/time-to-think-out-of-box-delhi-deputy-cm-manish-sisodia-opens-centre-of-excellence-for-ai-at-tech-university/articleshow/92709475.cms
2022-06-24,Indiaâ€™s AI investment in 2023 will be only 2.5% of global total: Nasscom,TNN,"Bengaluru: India is the world’s second largest hub in training and hiring AI talent, but rapid growth in AI applications has led to a surge in hiring for AI professionals, leading to a shortage of talent, a study by Nasscom , along with EY and with support from Microsoft , EXL and Capgemini, has said. The study, a first of its kind initiative called `AI Adoption Index’ for India and released on Thursday, finds that firms are increasingly relying on contracting and gig models while focusing on building internal AI talent through reskilling and upskilling. The study finds that four sectors – BFSI, CPG & retail, healthcare, and industrials & automotive – could contribute about 60% of AI’s potential value-add of $450-500 billion to India’s GDP by 2025. Global investments in AI, it said, have more than doubled from 2020 ($36 billion) to 2021 ($77 billion). Though AI investments in India is growing at a CAGR of 30.8% and is poised to reach $881 million by 2023, the study says it will represent just 2.5% of the total global AI investments of $340 billion. At the launch of the report, Nasscom president Debjani Ghosh said the pandemic has made it absolutely time critical for organisations to move from data & technology silos to building specialised AI capabilities at scale across sectors combined with a structured data utilisation strategy. She said AI adoption has to be a CEO priority, a strategic priority, and not one to be left to the IT team. She said organisations have to look at whether they are hiring the right talent, they need to measure the impact of AI initiatives to understand what has gone right, what has not. The AI Adoption Index, she said, will not only provide the necessary benchmark for organisations on AI maturity but will also help them take the key structural steps to realise AI’s potential to tangible national value. Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said India’s long term success will depend on employing AI on a large scale. He said there are numerous use cases, including in facial recognition for pensioners who cannot come to the bank, in crime management, in school attendance, even in pothole management. He said India can be leaders in AI, given the amount of data we have. The study found that 65% of organisations have AI strategy defined either at a functional or enterprise level. “Although process optimisation continues to be the primary driver of AI adoption amongst organisations, there is a rising focus on achieving customer-centric goals leveraging AI as a tool for innovation and growth. Larger organisations are driving innovation with AI, helped by dedicated budgets, resources and alignment with broader objectives.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/indias-ai-investment-in-2023-will-be-only-2-5-of-global-total-nasscom/articleshow/92424571.cms
2022-06-19,'Artificial Intelligence is rewriting the game',TNN,"Sports guest editors Viswanathan Anand and Anurag Thakur talk to TOI about the game-changing dynamics of the Chess Olympiad ... Viswanathan Anand has decided to don a new hat. The five-time world chess champion, who is still an active p layer at 52 and has defeated the world's top player, Magnus Carlsen , twice recently, will contest for the post of deputy president in the FIDE (world chess body) elections. He is also the face of the Chess Olympiad, which will be held in India for the very first time, in Chennai in July-August this year. Anand, looking relaxed in a light summer coat, joined sports minister Anurag Thakur during an interaction with TOI in the Capital on Saturday. The two Guest Sports Editors talked about the way ahead for chess, plans to popularise the sport at the grassroots level and stage more international tournaments to give aspiring youngsters exposure to top-quality chess. Excerpts from the interaction... India is hosting such a big chess event for the first time since the Anand versus Carlsen battle in 2003. The government has planned many events around it. Your thoughts... Anurag Thakur: It's a big moment for India. I am sitting next to the five-time world chess champion who has made the country proud on several occasions. More than 190 countries will be participating in the event. I am sure that the famous Indian hospitality will spread the word that India doesn't only produce world class chess champions but also plays a great host. The Olympiad will help create awareness about the sport among the m asses. Khelo India chess could be the next big thing. Talking about Khelo India, it's an ambitious project. How much has it managed to meet expectations as an enabler to success in the Olympic Games? Thakur: We have already spent close to Rs 2600 crore in the last four years on Khelo India, whether it's the infrastructure for the game or other initiatives. In the recent edition of the Khelo India Youth Games (KIYG), 12 national records were broken and 11 of them were female athletes who broke them. It clearly shows that young talent is coming forward and are getting the opportunities and platform to excel. Khelo India chess will be one such campaign which will create awareness among the masses about the sport. Chess has failed to make its way into the Olympics despite being one of the most played games across the world. If elected to the FIDE deputy president's post, would you be making a serious effort to get it included in the Games programme? Viswanathan Anand: Chess has an application pending with the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The FIDE has continued to pursue it very seriously. These things take time and, of course, if our team wins (the elections) and I become the deputy president, I will continue to work on that policy. It's an excellent idea to have chess in the Olympics. But, at the same time, I am quite excited about the Olympiad happening in India. A country must have the world's biggest sporting event happening regularly. It's one thing to show that you can do it once and we have organised the events before. But, it's important to keep hosting these events regularly to showcase your growth. The consequences for chess are even far greater. It's the first huge, mega chess event which is happening in India. And, somehow, I think the timing couldn't have been better. Chess has had a revival in the last few decades and, recently, during the pandemic, the popularity has grown a lot. This is a fantastic opportunity using the Olympiad as an anchor to have nationwide movement and get more and more people engaged with the game. I hope we will see the benefits in years to come. Thakur: I am glad that the FIDE has taken this call to start the Olympiad Torch Relay. The government pitched for this kind of event because, in a vast country like India where you have the representation from more than 190 countries, it's important to create awareness about the game. The Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself will be launching the torch relay on Sunday to take the movement to every state and city of the country. UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE: Anand (on the left; seen here with Thakur) hopes his experience as a player will aid his new role as chess administrator. (TOI Photo) Do players take naturally to sports administration, or do they grow into the job? Is it better left to the experts who are experienced in administration? Anand: The way I see it, I would join a team which has already been running world chess for the last four years. And, of course, all functions will be distributed among everyone. My focus would be to try and expand the game's reach by taking the advantage of new technologies and the possibilities that have opened up during the pandemic. Chess has benefitted a lot from the Internet and now the game is growing on live coverage and all. I will try to focus on that part. It (my role) will also be slightly India-centric because I will try to expand its reach here. There will be a little bit of everything. I am a chess player, so I don't have much experience in this area. But, at the same time, I bring a unique perspective with my candidature, a perspective of chess players and their experiences. So, from the professional side, I think I can also be, in a sense, a representative of the players and hear their concerns and address them. I don't see my job being very specialist. We will all work together as a team. MASTERS OF THE GAME: Anand plays world No. 1 Magnus Carlsen in the fifth round of the Classical section in the Norway Chess tournament. (PTI Photo) Along with big-budget events like World Championships and Olympiad, don't you think the real focus should be on giving high-level training to a large pool of upcoming players so that some of them graduate to ELO 2600 bracket without huge financial struggle? Anand: I agree with the premise but it's not either-or. You need the big events to drive interest, for people to come and watch. Imagine, for instance at the Olympiad, one of the Indian teams wins the medal, or perhaps, multiple medals. Then imagine how many people would pick up the sport. So, there's a constant need to spread your efforts and get more people introduced to the game. At the same time, it's important to work with the youngsters. I have been having this Westbridge Anand Chess Academy where I am working with top seven juniors in India, six boys and one girl. By regularly hosting such big tournaments in India, we will create an atmosphere where our players won't have to go abroad to play the best players. In fact, the best will come to India to play us. Thakur: During the Olympiad, six players each from every state will be picked and they will get an opportunity to come there and interact with the international players, take chess lessons and learn from their experiences. We, in the government, will continue with the ongoing process of creating more sports academies and playing opportunities for our talented players. We are very much open about having chess included in the Khelo India programme. In recent years, chess enthusiast Youtubers have created a huge following for the game, especially during the pandemic. Samay Raina is one such person. How do you look at this trend? Anand: I think any growth in the game is good, it's beyond dispute. Any growth will require you to change and adapt and be more flexible. As you can imagine, any audience which comes to watch chess on YouTube or some of the streaming services like Twitch, is different from the one which likes to visit a tournament, which wants different formats, different time controls and points scoring system. But you can't deny the fact that the resources available, too, have increased. We should welcome the technology change and find a way to address each audience's needs specifically. It was also kind of unexpected that out of all the people, a comedian got this ball rolling in India. We are tapping an audience which perhaps found chess intimidating but they were interested at the same time. They found it intimidating but when a comedian started making jokes every two sentences about the chess game, they were able to get in and go further. Again, like in advertising, you have to target a new audience. In chess too, this works perfectly. How much has the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) impacted chess and is it a positive change? Anand: Talking about AI, it's a good thing. It has changed the dynamics and you can't fight it. But there's a specific reason why I find it good. It means that the cost and effort of training is continuously dropping, as the most sophisticated training methods become available to every computer and every mobile device. It becomes easier and easier to train and improve yourself. But, equally, I want to emphasize that the real benefit is for countries which have no chess tradition or no existing chess work. These people are no longer cut off anymore. They used to be, when they needed to travel somewhere to meet someone to play chess. Now, they have it on their phones or computers. This is what AI has done. It will only increase the reach of the game. Inevitably, the central world chess has to adapt to this new order, but then it's growing the game and that's good in itself. So the sport has to adapt and this is one of those things I'll try to focus on, if elected to the post. These are fantastic times for chess and we should grab the opportunities. Does AI make too much of a difference now in how you prepare for a game? And what happens if a talented chess player lacks access to AI-based programmes? Anand: AI is rewriting the game. I'll tell you why. We all grew up with legendary champions and some of the games that they had played. And this is the basis of chess learning. You study the legendary champions' game and try to build on that. Well, AI is showing that there are thousand other approaches to learn, which haven't been tried but which are also interesting. I am not going to study the new conclusions. I am only going to work on the old ones because you have to adapt to these new methods. As far access is concerned, there isn't a contradiction. Access is becoming cheaper and easier, it will mean that those who don't have access will now get it. I feel that the digital divide as such is a real problem, but we can operate at two levels. One is as the technology itself becomes easier to access. It's important for the federations world over to make an effort to make sure that everyone has access. If you go to a village and they don't have access, we will set it up…that should be the approach. And we have to speed it up, amplify it. It's wonderful that we are riding that wave. We don't have a choice. If we don't use AI, someone else will be better than us. So, we can't resist it. The Olympiad without Russia is like having a football World Cup without Brazil. What's your take? Should countries at war stop participating in international tournaments? Anand: Well, this is an exceptional circumstance here. Obviously, everyone hopes that the situation doesn't continue for long and there's some sort of peace to be found before the next Olympiad . But, for this Olympiad, there's nothing to be done. This is just one of those things we have to accept and move on. Even without Brazil, you can have a good World Cup. But, we should also appreciate the fact that India has been able to host the Olympiad in three months. It's a miracle. How has the government been helping Anand diplomatically in his campaigning as FIDE deputy president? Thakur: It's an honour for the country to have representatives from India at the top level who are able to win elections at the international federations and associations. It helps because they are much more aware of what is happening at the policy level and also they can bring international events to India. So, whenever and wherever required, anyone who will be approaching the government for any kind of elections, we will help from our side. We will look into it very seriously.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/chess/artificial-intelligence-is-rewriting-the-game/articleshow/92311227.cms

2022-06-10,AI cams to warn about wild jumbos,T Ramavarman,"The thermally-enabled cameras are able to detect the images of the elephants even during the night hours and warn drivers of vehicles passing through the area in advance THRISSUR: The forest department is experimenting with an artificial intelligence camera system to detect the presence of wild elephants on the road in Athirappilly area and to prevent accidents. Two AI cameras have been placed at a road location which is simultaneously a blind turn and an area frequented by elephants. Several road accidents have happened in the area because of the unexpected appearance of the elephants, according to Chalakkudy DFO Sambudha Majumder . The thermally-enabled cameras and the AI software developed by the Dubai-based firm Invendo I Technology are able to detect the images of the elephants even during the night hours and warn the drivers. “The problem with the CCTV cameras placed in forest areas is that they have to be manually monitored. Also, when we monitor CCTV images visually we may not be able to pick up alerts on the presence of elephants each and every time. In this case, the AI software will give a more accurate information on whether the image is that of an elephant or not,” he said. “The software has been developed recently. By relying on the past images, it can inform us the presence of an elephant, even if the cameras have captured only a portion like part of a foot of an elephant. As far as I know this technology has not been tried elsewhere in the forests in Kerala ,” the DFO said. When the system detects elephants, it gives an alarm, and the alerts are then displayed on LED boards put on the road. “The trials have been going on for about a month and the camera systems are issuing alerts after capturing the images of elephants. We have also put people there to physically correlate whether the system is capturing all the elephants passing through the area,” the DFO said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ai-cams-to-warn-about-wild-jumbos/articleshow/92115034.cms
2022-06-05,AI-based device to help bikers with a smooth ride,Nirupa Vatyam,"Hyderabad: In an attempt to assist two-wheeler riders with a safe commute, four students from the KL Hyderabad campus (deemed to be university) have developed an AI-based tool that can detect obstacles on their way and alert them about it. The device has been designed to detect rocks, sand, and potholes and send out a signal to the rider through an indication on the speedometer — blinking LEDs — and also through voice commands. Speaking about it, Cherutanuri Sai Santosh Reddy, a second-year CSE student said: “I decided to build this device after seeing my cousin struggling to ride on a road full of potholes.” Santosh said that the device, developed by him along with his classmates Cherukuri Shravan Sairam, Boddu Avinash , and Marri Akhil Reddy, will be useful for both beginners and experienced riders. It also consists of a night vision camera with 4k resolution, an alerting system, bluetooth speakers, and LED lights. “The device is fitted near the speedometer. Whenever an obstacle is detected at a distance of about 10 meters an alert is sent,” said Shravan adding that this can be a lifesaver on the city roads. He said that the team has tested the device on campus and is created to work for both bicycles and bikes, both geared and non-geared vehicles. “With some modification, the system can be adapted for four-wheelers as well,” he added. While the four spent about Rs 12, 000 to manufacture the device, they said it can be scaled up if manufactured in large quantities. In the next semester, the students are planning to introduce the device first on their campus and subsequently tie up with bike manufacturers. “Right now, the accuracy is about 67%. While the device is accurately detecting rocks and sand, the accuracy while detecting pits is not 100%. Once we fix it, we will introduce it on the campus,” said Shravan. While Shravan, Santosh, and Avinash are from Hyderabad, Akhil is a resident of Sanga Reddy .",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ai-based-device-to-help-bikers-with-a-smooth-ride/articleshow/92013446.cms

Called CropLens, the prototype pilot has been taken up by AI-based agritech startup Cropin and Dutch social enterprise Space4Good, which uses earth observation tech, across seven districts of AP. As part of this, crop data is being collected from about 500 farmers in each season (Kharif and Rabi ) from West Godavari, East Godavari, Nellore, Guntur, Krishna, Prakasam, and Chittoor. CropLens prototype has the potential to be replicated not just elsewhere in India but also other parts of the world, said Dr Sugandh Chauhan , project lead (AP project), Space4Good, adding that the plan is to also include some districts of Telangana later as part of the project. Using time-series satellite images, CropLens will be able to identify the paddy-growing areas in the region and the specific signatures of the likelihood of pest and disease infestation using weather data, which will improve modelling accuracy against certain weather conditions that favour infestation and facilitate spread, said Alexander Gunkel , MD & founder, Space4Good. The project also aims to evolve a cost-effective mitigation process that can help considerably reduce the need for harmful pesticides and water contamination, Kunal Prasad, co-founder & COO, Cropin said.

While the authorities wake up to clear the mess once in a while, within days the situation is back to square one. To improve parking infrastructure in city, the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation now is pushing for an AI-powered Integrated Parking Management System ( IPMS ) that is expected to bring more than 55 parking lots managed by it under one command system. “The GMC is mulling to introduce IPMS under which an integrated control room will be set up that will be linked to a mobile application that can be used by commuters to get instant updates on occupancy and space availability at parking lots,” Sanjeev Sinha, GMC’s chief tax assessment officer, said. Parking lots under IPMS will also include glow signs at entry and exit points, pink toilets, a firefighting system, CCTV cameras and power backup. “The proposal has been submitted before the GMC executive committee and board. While the IPMS will be introduced only after its approval, we have initiated the process for its implementation,” Sinha said. A private firm hired by the civic body to conduct a survey of parking lots across the city for the project, meanwhile, has also submitted its recommendations on parking fees that could increase the rate by at least five times. The rates as of now vary from Rs 10 to Rs 50 for all types of vehicles. There have been frequent complaints against private managers for charging commuters arbitrarily. While the new rates, officials said, are yet to be finalised parking a car for a workday could cost nearly Rs 100 if the recommendations are accepted. As per the proposed hourly rates, four-wheelers may have to pay Rs 40 for the first two hours and Rs 20 every two hours thereafter. For two-wheelers, one may have to shell out Rs 20 for the first two hours and Rs 10 every two hours thereafter. For heavy vehicles, the rate for the first two hours has been proposed at Rs 80, while Rs 40 will be charged for every two hours subsequently. Presently, there are 44 parking lots in Vasundhara zone, 10 in Kavinagar zone and one in Mohan Nagar zone.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/gmc-plans-ai-powered-parking-to-notify-motorists-of-free-spots/articleshow/91952388.cms
2022-05-28,AI model to predict mortality of heart attack survivors,Durgesh Nandan Jha,"NEW DELHI: Every year, nearly 13-14 lakh people in India suffer from a very serious type of heart attack during which one of the heart’s major arteries is blocked. Of them, 8-9% die within 30 days due to complications as well as lack of timely intervention. This condition is known to cardiologists as ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction ( STEMI ). An artificial intelligence or machine-learning model developed by Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT)-Delhi in collaboration with cardiologists from Delhi’s G B Pant Hospital and Harvard Medical School, among others, promises to change this. The model, which is available online, has been developed by Dr Anubha Gupta of IIIT-Delhi. It can predict the risk of all-cause mortality within 30 days of a heart attack by analysing 31 key characteristics of a patient. These include age, gender, family history of heart disease, treatment history, time taken to reach hospital and the time taken to do angioplasty. Dr Mohit Gupta, professor of cardiology at G B Pant Hospital, who was the principal investigator of the project, told TOI that the models used currently to predict the mortality risk have been validated mostly in the western population. “This is the first time an algorithm or model that identifies risk factors that are unique to the Indian population, for example delayed presentation and lack of angioplasty, has been developed,” he said. He added that the results of the study conducted to validate the accuracy of the model have been published in International Journal of Cardiology. Dr Gupta said G B Pant is running a registry which collates data of all heart attack patients in north India. The model to predict mortality in STEMI cases was developed using the data of 3,191 STEMI patients from the registry. “At 30 days, the mortality was 7.7%. On the validation dataset, the machine learning model could pick up chances of all-cause mortality in more than 85% cases correctly,” said Dr Gupta. Dr Ashok Seth , chairman of Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, said the study was a landmark one. “In-hospital mortality rates in STEMI cases are approaching 4-5% in developed nations. The model developed by IIIT-Delhi and G B Pant Hospital may serve as an important tool to reduce mortality rates in India too. This could help in triaging STEMI cases and prioritising intervention, medical therapy or angioplasty, based on the risk score of the patients,” he said. TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) and GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) scores, two of the most popular models used currently for risk stratification in STEMI cases in India, were developed and validated abroad. “In India, a major factor for all-cause mortality in STEMI cases is delayed hospitalisation. Also, in many peripheral hospitals, angioplasty facilities are not available. So, they give only medical therapy and refer the patient. All these factors aren’t considered as strongly in models developed abroad. The indigenous model takes the local factors into account,” say doctors.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/ai-model-to-predict-mortality-of-heart-attack-survivors/articleshow/91843625.cms

2022-05-18,"Tamil Nadu: Use artificial intelligence to cut jumbo deaths, National Green Tribunal tells railways",Ram Sundaram,"Previous attempts like ultraviolet-based early warning and message alert systems proved to be unsuccessful. CHENNAI: The National Green Tribunal ( NGT ) on Tuesday directed Southern Railways and forest departments of Tamil Nadu and Kerala to explore the possibility of using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems to prevent elephant deaths on Coimbatore-Palakkad railway line. They have been told to convene meetings frequently to discuss methodologies if the existing systems do not work as expected. Previous attempts like ultraviolet-based early warning and message alert systems proved to be unsuccessful as elephant deaths were on the rise and in the past one year four from the Coimbatore forest region died in train collisions. NGT wants government agencies to install an AI-based system which can alert the loco pilot at a sufficient distance on locating the passage of the elephant and other wild animals so that they can reduce the speed and avoid accidents. The Southern Railway has started working with Advantech Group of Company to find a permanent solution to this. As a part of a pilot project at Pannimadai village in Coimbatore, they have installed infrared cameras at multiple locations, which can detect elephants 3-6 km away. Once detected, an alert with a claimed accuracy of 87% to 95% can be raised through a centrally-monitored control setup on a real-time basis. But railways has estimated that it might need three more months to commission it. Admitting this, NGT has directed them to implement it soon along with other recommendations made by the Union ministry of environment in its report. The Centre had suggested shifting a few passenger trains operated at night from Line B (Palakkad-Podanur Up line constructed in 1974) to Line A (Podanur-Palakkad Down line laid during 1861) as 78% of the accidents in the past two decades were reported in Line B. Besides this, it recommended engagement of five more anti-depredation watchers to drive away elephants from crop raiding, night watch surveillance programme and more night watch towers. The forest departments told the tribunal that they are working on it. So, NGT disposed of the case with a direction to all government stakeholders to provide necessary funding and staff strength for effective implementation.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/use-ai-to-cut-jumbo-deaths-ngt-to-rlys/articleshow/91627724.cms

2022-05-11,New AI system will change the way you move in city,Aditya Dev,"Noida: From June 15, more than 1,000 cameras at 84 intersections in the city will be switched on to change traffic light signals based on commuter density, facilitate ‘green corridors’ in cases of emergency, and gather evidence of accidents and traffic rule violations. Trials for the Integrated Traffic Management System ( ITMS ) project — based on artificial intelligence (AI) and monitored by a control room — are ongoing at 25 intersections in the city, officials said on Tuesday, adding that it will be launched across Noida next month. One of its notable features will be the ease with which a green corridor can be created with just one click from the ITMS control room, built in Sector 94. “The staff at the command centre will turn signals on one side of the entire road to green in a sequence. At the same time, the signals for all other routes will remain red. Besides, live announcements will be made at each intersection, declaring the green corridor. As soon as an ambulance is through, traffic will resume as usual,” Noida Authority deputy general manager SP Singh said. He gave the example of such a corridor being created between Sector 22 to Delhi via the Rajnigandha Crossing and said route would normally include 6 traffic lights on intersections in the city. Before this, green corridors were created with the collective effort of police and their traffic wing to clear roads of regular vehicles. Instead, ITMS will employ technology to its aid and use fewer human resources. Singh said 1,065 multi-dimensional cameras were being installed at 84 intersections in the city at a cost of Rs 65 crore. For daily commuters, the ITMS adaptive traffic light control system will change signals on the basis of volume of vehicles at 40 busy crossings in the city such as Sector 18. For instance, it may change the signal to green on roads where a traffic jam is beginning. If the density is lower on the other side, signals may be kept on ‘red’ a little longer than the usual time period. Violators of traffic rules will be documented through CCTV cameras as ITMS will maintain a database. Speed detection systems have been installed at 18 locations, including Charkha Chowk in Sector 94 and the Okhla Bird Sanctuary Metro station, Singh said. On Tuesday, officials carried out a test of the public announcement system, in which commuters were asked to stay behind zebra crossings and wear helmets. The system to issue a challan to a traffic violator was also tested. Screens have been put at 22 spots in Noida to disseminate traffic advisories and alerts. Officials told TOI that four types of cameras have been deployed -- Automatic Number Plate Reader (693), 278 fixed cameras (278), pan-tilt-zoom cameras (76) and speed detection cameras (18). These will also gather evidence in crime and accident cases apart from traffic management, they said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/new-ai-system-will-change-the-way-you-move-in-city/articleshow/91478362.cms

The city police, in a letter to the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority ( AUDA ), has requested speed limit boards be installed along the road. Senior police officials claim that the issue was taken up at the road safety council meeting held in the first week of April. The city police plan to install AI-powered smart cameras and position traffic policemen with speed guns to detect overspeeding and issue challans to the violators. “In the last five years, we have identified 18 major accident hotspots on SP Ring Road. Installation of speed limit boards on the ring road is on the agenda of the road safety council,” said a senior AUDA official. An audit of vehicle speeds carried out recently by an independent institute revealed the top mean speeds of vehicles at eight spots on SP Ring Road. These ranged between 80.35kmph and 72.86kmph — far too high for city roads. Since 2012, 482 major accidents have been recorded on SP Ring Road; of these, 137 were fatal and 144 involved grievous injuries. “Most victims were two-wheeler riders or pedestrians who were hit by speeding vehicles while crossing the road or negotiating a roundabout on the arterial road,” added the AUDA official. The dangerous stretches on SP Ring Road include the Odhav junction and the stretch at Naroda. On the western portion of the road, a majority of the accidents were recorded near Bopal junction. The Aslali and Adalaj circles also witnessed maximum fatal accidents, claimed the AUDA offcial. “We found 18 spots, including junctions and roundabouts on SP Ring Road that were most prone to accidents.

2022-04-05,AI starts scanning traffic violations on Kolkata roads,Dwaipayan Ghosh,"KOLKATA: The Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based traffic system has started its trial run in three Kolkata traffic guards. The software has already been uploaded at the Lalbazar control room. According to police sources, the AI software will scan CCTV images and will send congestion and breakdown alerts and make accurate congestion prediction at important junctions along the North-South corridor (the SP Mukherjee Road-JL Nehru Road-CR Avenue corridor). It will detect motorists driving while on the phone and those driving without a seat-belt or a helmet. Cops will scan images generated by over 2,500 CCTV cameras in Kolkata — 125 of which can read licence plates — to prosecute offenders and detect snarls. For this, the software will have to be integrated with the cameras. “The vendor set up its system at the traffic control room last week. A few senior officers have now been tasked to prepare daily reports on the efficacy of the system and provide a proper demonstration of the system. This will be a major indicator on how we go about integrating AI in the city’s traffic system,” said a senior police officer. When contacted, DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha confirmed that the system was at an advanced stage of testing. Earlier, two firms had approached Kolkata Police with their AI solutions and both were asked to fit the software at the control room to allow cops to test the efficacy of the software in real time, especially during traffic rush hours. During the test run at some of the biggest guards in central and south Kolkata, the proposed software, claimed sources, should have a robust mechanism against the influences of environmental variations. This will include shadow effects, illumination changes and different weather conditions. The project, which is seen worldwide as one of the key traffic problem-solving tools, is already in limited use in cities like Bangalore and Mumbai. In Kolkata, the central business district has also seen the use of AI, albeit for crime-detection purposes. The process, claimed sources, has its genesis in 2021 when Kolkata Police had sought detailed presentation from tech experts to help understand the advanced machine learning that are being increasingly used for detecting helmetless bikers and illegal parking. In 2020, among the 39.4 lakh traffic violations recorded on Kolkata streets, 7.3 lakh were detected via CCTV footage. In 2021, this percentage is stated to have gone up though Lalbazar is yet to release the figures. The thrust on technology, an officer said, will also reduce the risk to officers who physically try to stop offending motorists. “The systems will also generate challans. It will be automatic, with a web interface to verify the alerts. From there, it will be connected to the existing RTO website to generate challans and send SMS notifications to riders,” said an officer.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ai-starts-scanning-traffic-violations-on-city-roads/articleshow/90651622.cms

2022-03-15,Intelligent use of Artificial intelligence must for universal healthcare: Experts,Farheen Hussain,"BENGALURU: Artificial intelligence (AI) will help make sense of the rich data in the health sector and provide early diagnosis and preventive approaches on diseases. This was the consensus among experts speaking on ‘Health AI for Bharat’ during the ARTPARK Innovation Summit 2022 on Monday. AI & Robotics Technology Park is a Bengaluru-based not-for-profit foundation, promoted by IISc and supported by AI Foundry . Dr Vijay Chandru , commissioner, Lancet Commission for Reimagining India’s Health System, said the country needs a paradigm shift in technology and healthcare to reach the goal of achieving universal healthcare by 2030. “AI can play an important role in prevention and early detection of cancer. At the same time, technological advancement will take healthcare to people’s doorstep. There won’t be a need for primary health centres or big labs with hand-held devices and miniaturisation,” Dr Chandru said. Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw , executive chairperson, Biocon, said AI can bridge the challenge of shortage in the number of pathologists and people who can interpret radiological data. “It will be a path-breaking application of AI to interpret radiological data, giving us an accurate output from which we could derive accurate treatment,” she said, adding that the challenge will be integrating the data. Pranav Saxena, chief technology and product officer, Flipkart Healthtech, said the issue with data is that it has not been digitised. “We must make our mobiles smarter from a health perspective and capture more data like simple vitals. Electronic medical also needs to be tracked,” he said.

Haryana govt plans institute of emerging tech, seeks ideas from firms",Bagish Jha,"GURUGRAM: The state government has proposed an institute of emerging technologies in Haryana to impart professional training on artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing, big-data analysis, 3D printing and cryptography. The institute, the government conjectured, will prepare young students to adapt to upcoming technologies, which they would then use to solve problems in our society. On Saturday, the government held a meeting with consultancy companies in Gurgaon to discuss the idea and structure of the institute and asked the companies to submit their concept papers for the institute by the end of March. At the meeting, officials decided that the institute would not focus on providing a degree or diploma but on producing professionals who would help solve societal problems. The institute will also have a strong connection with the industries, apart from focusing on research and development of new-age technologies. Anand Mohan Saran , additional chief secretary, technical education, Haryana, said that the state needs highly-skilled, qualified professionals to tap into modern technologies coming up across the world, adding that the institute will plug that gap. “To compete with the modern economies in knowledge and technology, there is a need to establish a modern autonomous institute with the help of national and international institutes of repute. Our institute will focus on preparing a high-quality professional, who will make use of emerging technologies for development in the country,” said Saran , adding that the 2020-2021 Budget first proposed such institutes. Officials with the technical education department and the State Council of Educational Research & Training (SCERT), the deputy commissioner of Gurgaon, etc., discussed the infrastructural requirements of the institute, both physical and digital, at the meeting. Saran said that it would be a greenfield project on unused land, and the government would want to develop it as one of the best technical institutes in the world. “After receiving the concept papers from the companies, the department will study and prepare a summary report that will get shared with all stakeholders before further action is taken in this regard,” he added.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/ai-or-big-data-govt-plans-institute-of-emerging-tech-seeks-ideas-from-firms/articleshow/90022643.cms

2022-02-24,Maharashtra PG medical aspirants unwilling to relinquish allotted seat for AI mop-up,Hemali Chhapia,"MUMBAI: Postgraduate medical aspirants are in a quandary as candidates who want to participate in the all-India (AI) mop-up round will be required to give up the seat allotted to them in the state admission counselling. And that, candidates explained, would go against natural merit. Aspiring PG candidates said that the counselling would not be merit based if the CET cell did not change this rule. Aspirants who could not bag a seat in state counselling due to lower rank would be able to participate in all-India mop-up round and get better seat than those who with higher ranks but couldn’t participate as they did not give up their allotted seat. Also, there is no guarantee on whether candidates would get a seat at all in the all-India mop-up round if they gave up their seat. Aspirants have therefore asked that they be allowed to retain their assigned seat in the state till the results of the mop-up round are declared. Candidates from Maharashtra are apparently the only ones who are in such a fix. They have written to the state’s CET cell and asked authorities to alter the admission process rules. “Students of Maharashtra have been told by the state counselling helpline that we have to leave our state R2 (round 2) seat before participating in the all-India mop-up round. This is unfair for us in so many ways,” said candidates in their letter. For these MBBS graduates, the all-India round would have candidates from all states who are not allotted a seat in the earlier rounds of the all-India quota. “It is impossible to predict whether or not we will get our desired branch seat in all-India mop-up, so the state seat should be in our hands until we get the AI mop-up results,” said the letter to the state CET cell. There is more. As Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative, explained, “Every year, the date for relinquishing an allotted seat of round 2 is before the AI mop-up round. Since admission rules have been changed this year by the Medical Counselling Committee , there would be no reverting of seats to the state. Moreover, as government colleges and DNB colleges are participating in AI mop-up, the state’s CET should also change their rule of free exit from round 2 accordingly. Since the AI mop-up round is now not like it used to be until last year, it is very important for our candidates to be able to participate in that.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-pg-med-aspirants-unwilling-to-relinquish-alloted-seat-for-ai-mop-up/articleshow/89785031.cms
2022-02-21,Citizens to keep an eye on under care saplings via AI,Swati Shinde Gole,"Pune: The Pune Knowledge Cluster (PKC) led by scientist Ajit Kembhavi and his team have started an artificial intelligence-enabled interactive platform to monitor and track of saplings and allow citizens to adopt them via sponsorship. A pilot platform will be launched on February 26. Citizens will participate in sapling data collection, nurturing, care and learn more about the saplings through nature walks and games that will be organized from time to time. The programme titled ConnecTree will be implemented in collaboration with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), Pune Smart City , CEEIndia and community participation. Senior advisor and head of the adopt-a-sapling programme, Anita Kane , said, “ConnecTree enables citizens to develop a strong bond with the trees around them. They will not only watch their saplings grow; they also have an opportunity to record phenological observations as they grow. Interactions with botanists and ecologists will enrich their knowledge and understanding.” The programme started on July 12 last year with Pune Smart City. About 75 saplings were planted along the road at Baner outside Oakwood Hills. Public funds were raised by PKC and 50 tree guards were installed. This was done in response to citizens’ concern that the saplings needed to be protected from goats. Citizen engagement activities such as nature walk, environment games and a ConnecTree platform demo have been planned during this launch. PKC will be organizing a public event near Oakwood Hills Society, Baner from 8.30am to 10am for a follow-up. Saplings of Ashok, bakul, jambhul, kanchan, karanj, saptaparni, taman , yellow gulmohar have been planted and taken care of by sponsors. Kane said that, “Corporates, individuals and resident welfare associations and NGOs can support the programme by adopting saplings. We are looking for CSR funds to create a robust version of the platform.” There are extensive plantations that are taken up in the city, especially during the monsoon season by PMC, volunteer groups, NGOs and corporate houses. Saplings planted along the roadside are especially vulnerable and need to be nurtured for the first few years.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/citizens-to-keep-an-eye-on-under-care-saplings-via-ai/articleshow/89711860.cms

2022-02-13,"Courses get re-engineered in colleges; artificial intelligence, data science in",Hemali Chhapia,"MUMBAI: In a major re-engineering exercise, technical colleges across India have opted to reset their offerings, closing down branches that do not have many takers and instead opting for other courses in the new, emerging areas. The year 2021-22 saw AICTE approve almost 40,000 seats in new, emerging programmes, with the highest in artificial intelligence and machine learning — 13,950 — followed by AI and data science, with 11,040 seats. Seats in these courses are being snapped up. And in the ongoing admission season across India, institutes are filling up these seats faster than the core engineering branches. Sources in AICTE said many more colleges are making a beeline to close down traditional branches which have few takers and instead opting for newer courses. At the same time, in the last two years, 11,000 mechanical engineering seats have been done away with. Similarly, civil engineering has seen a reduction of approximately 10,000 seats between 2020 and 2022. “Colleges are surely getting more students in the new emerging courses. When these students graduate, they will have more job opportunities. But we are treading a cautious path. We cannot close down civil and mechanical or electrical engineering. A few years down the line, there will be a shortage of these engineering graduates, which will make the supply lopsided,” said AICTE chairman Anil Sahasrabudhe . For instance, at Sona College of Technology , Salem, seat intake was reduced for civil, mechanical and electrical engineering. This being the first year when emerging areas of engineering were introduced, the college, like many others, wanted to test waters. Chocko Valliappa , vice-chairman, said, “While all seats in new areas we are offering like AI, biomedical engineering and data science are filled, even after cutting seat intake in traditional branches, we are yet to fill all seats there.” In Maharashtra too, several colleges opted for the new programmes. Thadomal Shahani College of Engineering closed down biotechnology and biomedical engineering and started AI and data science, which are running full. “However, universities across India are not harnessing the full power of these new courses as courseware is created by currently set-up academic boards. So, AI and data science curricula are created by the board of computer science,” said principal G T Thampi. The coming year may alter the landscape of engineering education with many more colleges opting for newer programmes and thousands wanting to trim their capacity in traditional courses. “We are not advocating colleges to close down branches like civil, mechanical and electrical engineering. Instead, along with those as a major degree, students should be offered minors in these cutting-edge courses. So, students fit into civil engineering and machine learning; a lot of multi-disciplinary and cross-disciplinary combinations like machine learning and mechanical engineering, agriculture engineering and AI will be a powerful combination,” said Sahasrabudhe .",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/courses-get-re-engineered-in-colleges-ai-data-science-in/articleshow/89534917.cms
2022-02-10,IIT Madras research team develops artificial intelligence tool for conversion of biomass,TNN,"(L-R) Prof Niket S Kaisare, Krishna Gopal Sharma and Himanshu Goyal CHENNAI: An IIT-M research team has developed and used an artificial intelligence tool to study the production of gaseous fuel from biomass, which is expected to save time for experimental researchers involved in developing reactors and new techniques to convert biomass into products. The researchers said they developed a recurrent neural network ( RNN ) model, a machine learning model, to study the reactions that occur during the conversion of biomass into biofuel and chemicals. Researchers can use this model to come up with solutions, processes and plants to convert biomass to biofuel. “Experimental researchers can directly use this machine learning based model that is expected to save the time it takes for them to develop new processes. Using this technique, the researchers can come up with more optimal and economical ways to convert waste biomass into fuels and chemicals,” said professor Himanshu Goyal from department of chemical engineering, who worked with professor Niket S Kaisare also from department of chemical engineering, and Krishna Gopal Sharma , a fourth year B Tech student from department of computer science and engineering. The researchers said at present there are highly accurate and detailed models available, but most models are computationally expensive i.e take a long time to become operational. Artificial intelligence tools such as machine learning can hasten the modelling process. Also, experimental researchers working to develop new reactors and new techniques to convert biomass into useful products work on a trial and error method which is time consuming and expensive. “What we did is we used a highly detailed computational model we have in our lab to generate data and then use the RNN technique to come up with simple, elegant and computationally fast solution which can be directly used by experimental researchers in their research so that the trial and error process reduces,” Prof Goyal said. Prof Kaisare said, “The novelty of our machine learning approach is that it is able to predict the composition of the biofuel produced as a function of the time the biomass spends in the reactor. We used a statistical reactor for accurate data generation, which allows the model to be applied over a wide range of operating conditions.” The IITM research team also plans to use the AI tools in different aspects of clean energy like carbon capture and the electrification of the chemical industry.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/iit-madras-research-team-develops-artificial-intelligence-tool-for-conversion-of-biomass/articleshow/89464053.cms
2022-02-10,Bengaluru: Astronomers develop AI-based tools to help find habitable planets,TNN,"BENGALURU: Astronomers from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) in Bengaluru along with those from BITS Pilani , Goa campus have devised a new approach — an anomaly detection method — by which they can identify potentially habitable planets with a high probability. They have used an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithm for this. Pointing to how humans, since time immemorial, have been looking at the cosmos and believing other inhabited worlds are out there, the scientists said current estimates are that the number of planets in our Galaxy alone run into billions, possibly a number greater than the number of stars itself. IIA is an autonomous institute under the Department of Science and Technology (DST). And, as per DST, the question that naturally arose was “whether there are other life-harbouring planets and if there is a way to predict which exoplanet can potentially harbour life?” In the present work, IIA and BITS Pilani astronomers have devised this new approach based on the postulate that Earth is an anomaly, with the possibility of existence of few other anomalies among thousands of data points. The study is published in the journal, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS). According to the study, there are 60 potentially habitable planets out of about 5,000 confirmed, and nearly 8,000 candidate planets proposed. The assessment is based on their close similarity to Earth, the DST said, adding that these planets can be viewed as candidates for anomalous instances in a huge pool of ‘non-habitable’ exoplanets. IIA’s Margarita Safonova and BITS Pilani’s Snehanshu Saha argue that “Earth being the only habitable planet among thousands of planets is defined as an anomaly. We explored whether similar ‘anomaly’ candidates can be found using novel anomaly detection methods.” The IIA team explains that the fulcrum of the idea that postulates (potentially) habitable exoplanets as anomalies pivots around the well-known anomaly detection problem in predictive maintenance of industrial systems. “...Anomaly detection technique suitable for industrial systems applies equally well for habitable planet detection since in both cases, the anomaly detector is dealing with “imbalanced” data, where the anomalies (number of habitable exoplanets or anomalous behaviour of industrial components) are outliers. These are far less in number compared to the normal data,” the astronomers explain. It is a tedious job to scan thousands of planets manually and to identify planets potentially similar to Earth. Researchers have thus developed a novel AI-based algorithm to detect anomalies and extended it to an unsupervised clustering algorithm to use it to identify the probably habitable exoplanets from the exoplanet datasets.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/astronomers-develop-ai-based-tools-to-help-find-habitable-planets/articleshow/89464012.cms

2022-01-30,Dance meets AI at this virtual reality installation,Fathima Ashraf,"The meeting of tradition and technology was the highlight of week three of the Attakkalari India Biennial, a Transglocal Community Arts Engagement Initiative that has more than 12 countries taking part. CyberBallet by Berlin-based theatre collective, CyberRäuber, is a virtual reality (VR) interactive installation, which takes viewers on an immersive journey of movement and dance from the point of view of artificial intelligence. Held in 25-minute sessions, each with four participants, this stand-alone VR experience was conceptualised and produced by Marcel Karnapke and Björn Lengers in collaboration with Karlsruhe-based dance company, Badisches Staatsballett . CyberBallet explores what it means to be human, to be able to have a body and move around in a physical space. “The idea for this production was conceived in 2019. When the ballet company approached us for a collaboration, we were already in the process of thinking about AI and what it might mean in the field of art, especially the performing arts. So, we made an attempt to connect the two fields and explored the question of how a machine perceives movement,” says Lengers. To put the piece together, Karnapke and Lengers captured the movements of professional dancers, processed the data through machine-learning algorithms, and transferred them onto an interactive 3D stage. As a viewer, one is free to merely watch or perform along. Talking of the process of putting this together, Lengers says, “We wanted to capture what the dancers are doing. At first, we recorded the traditional two-dimensional video and then used 360-degree and 180-degree 3D cameras to record the movements of the dance ensemble in a prepared space. We also used a motion capture suit, which has over 19 little sensors that can be attached to the limbs.” Choreographed by German-Brazilian choreographer Ronni Maciel , the production features elevating music by Israeli composer Micha Kaplan . Immersed in space At the show, each participant gets a designated 5mx5m space in the hall where the installation is set up. As it begins, the viewer — equipped with VR headsets and headphones — is transported to outer space, surrounded by infinite space and stars. While one can see several dancers moving their bodies to the music, there are two enormous video walls facing each other, where a multitude of picture stories are running simultaneously. “Of course, one cannot see everything,” says Lengers, adding that what is most interesting is to watch how people interact. “Every reaction is special. Many moved and danced along with the choreography, while some focused on what was going on on the picture wall, ignoring the dancers. Any kind of reaction is okay. We do not want to force anyone to do anything. It is interesting to see how people interpret stuff, what they see and what they don’t,” he shares, adding that while CyberBallet was their foray into experimenting VR with dance, the team is already producing their next dance piece.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/events/bangalore/dance-meets-ai-at-this-virtual-reality-installation/articleshow/89201376.cms

2021-12-09,AI cameras at KSR Bengaluru City railway station will see through your mask,Christin Mathew Philip,"BENGALURU: Last month, a 41- year-old mentally disturbed woman went missing from east Bengaluru. The Railway Protection Force (RPF)’s control room in Bengaluru division received an alert and photograph of the woman at 11.35pm from a group of citizens. At 11.47pm, RPF personnel managed to trace the woman who was wearing a full-mask at KSR Bengaluru City railway station. The swift tracking happened with the help of AI-enabled face-recognition cameras. “We could trace her in just 12 minutes. In fact, relatives of the woman were also surprised that we could find her in such a short time,” said a RPF official. For the past nine months, a trial run of recognition cameras was on at the station. South Western Railway ( SWR ) officials said a full-fledged launch of the Rs 2.4- crore project will be held from next month. “We have installed 120 of the 150 AI-enabled cameras. We could identify 43 criminals in the last nine months through this system. We’ll install them at 18 more stations in Bengaluru division,” said a senior SWR official. A TOI report, ‘KSR, Yeshwantpur railway stations to get face-recognition cameras’ (May 6, 2019), had highlighted the plan. While facemasks are mandatory in public places after Covid-19, SWR officials said these cameras will detect people with masks too. Face-recognition cameras will recognise the face of a repeat offender/wanted persons involved in human trafficking, child kidnapping, smuggling, terrorist activities and other cases, then alert in cases of overcrowding stations, unclaimed baggage/objects, keep track of those who frequent ticket counters, including touts. “We never anticipated that all will have to wear face-masks. But we had thought of people entering the station covering their faces, using sunglasses or hats and other scenarios, so it has come handy now,” said an official. Asked about privacy concerns, another official said: “We’re not storing any data. We’re just matching faces in the database to records. In fact, most airports also have face-recognition cameras. Only criminals need to worry about this.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ai-cameras-at-ksr-station-will-see-through-your-mask/articleshow/88174896.cms

2021-12-01,UP: Lalitpur village girl's device among country's top-20 AI-based projects,Arindam Ghosh,"JHANSI : In an unique example of ‘atmanirbhar’ (self-reliant) woman representing digital India, a 14-year-old girl from a village of Lalitpur district has found place among the top 20 in the country, and only one from UP, in the artificial intelligence-based innovative project exhibition and award ceremony held at the India Habitat Centre, New Delhi on Tuesday. The award has come Nandani Kushwaha’s way for devising a smart data-based AI tool that identifies the most suitable crop for soil by analysing the various nutritional components present in it The entire initiative has been envisioned under the national programme for government schools, named ‘Responsible AI for youth’. It has been conceived and designed jointly by the national e-governance division, ministry of electronics and information technology, government of India and Intel India. The prodigal girl, a resident of village Patha under Mahroni tehsil of Lalitpur district, is a student of grade IX of GGIC. She was inspired by her mathematics teacher Prakash Bhushan Mishra during the Covid-19 lockdown, when the specially devised website under project ‘Responsible AI for youth’ was launched. At that time she was in grade VIII, studying in the upper primary school of her village. Inspired by her teacher, Nandani took online classes through her mobile phone and showed her talent. As a result, she was presented with a laptop by Intel India, which further pushed her motivation. Sensing the day-to-day problems related to skewed crop production because of poor soil quality, Nandani based her project on the issue and named it ‘Mitti ko jano, fasal pehchano’. Elaborating her project, Nadani said, “It is a smart data-based AI tool that identifies the most suitable crop for soil by analysing the various nutritional components present in it. This model can be deployed as a physical soil detection tool that will help farmers to understand their soil accurately and make informed decisions.” “With the help of my AI project, data is retrieved from the mud for its content of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity content, PH value and rainfall. Based on these data, we can predict the right choice of crop for getting optimal production. I have seen all the farmers, including my father, facing this challenge of low crop production for years together,” she said. “Despite the best of the efforts, they failed in achieving good results. This burning problem became my source of inspiration for selecting this project,” said Nandani over a phone call with TOI from India Habitat Centre, Delhi. She was invited to the programme along with other selected participants to receive the prize and display their projects during the ongoing weeklong ‘Azadi ka Digital Mahotsav’. The projects were viewed by some of the top scientists and experts from across the country. Talking to TOI about the outstanding achievement of Nandani, CDO Lalitpur, Anil Kumar Pandey said, “It is a very inspiring story for all the students of the district as well as the state. We will not only felicitate her once she comes here, but will set her example to motivate other students also.” Nandani was accompanied to the exhibition by her father, Jamunaprasad Kushwaha , a farmer, who had no idea as to what her daughter has achieved, except the fact that she has been invited for some big invention by the Union government.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/up-lalitpur-village-girls-device-among-countrys-top-20-ai-based-projects/articleshow/88016952.cms
2021-11-29,"Kolkata: Cops plan AI cover to identify and prosecute helmetless riders, no-parking rule violators",Dwaipayan Ghosh,"KOLKATA: The city police are planning to introduce artificial intelligence to scan images generated by over 2,500 CCTV cameras in Kolkata — 125 of which can read licence plates — to identify helmetless bikers and illegal parking in real time and prosecute offenders. In December, the Kolkata Police has sought detailed presentation from tech experts to help understand the advanced machine learning tools which are being increasingly used for detecting helmetless bikers and illegal parking. Once the cops zero in on the project, a detailed proposal will be sent to the state. DCP (traffic) Arijit Sinha said, “There are some plans in this regard. It is too early to comment till anything is finalised.” In 2020, among the 39.4 lakh traffic violations recorded on Kolkata streets, 7.3 lakh were detected via CCTV footage. According to an officer, several projects are being undertaken by academic bodies to identify helmetless bikers and their number plates in real time. The thrust on technology, an officer said, will also reduce the risk to officers who physically try to stop these bikes at personal risk. Police also want software models to identify illegal parking and trace the vehicle licence places. The software, which depends heavily on video data, will be installed in the road cameras that can read number plates and on the servers of the central Lalbazar police control room. This can be done by installing an embedded card attached to CCTV cameras, which helps detect helmetless bikers by sending out an alert. The artificial image recognition and processing solutions will also see alerts sent out when cameras detect vehicles in no-parking zones. This application can be implemented in real time using a webcam or a CCTV as input. IIT Hyderabad has developed a software using AI for automatic detection of bikers without helmets in surveillance videos. Recently, the institute signed an MoU with Hyderabad City Police to gain access to video. For illegal parking, the system uses IP camera to continuously capture and transfer image sequences to a base station whereby CNN is employed to realize automatic image features extraction in detecting illegally parked vehicles. The proposed software is robust against the influences of environmental variations, namely shadow effects, illumination changes and different weather conditions, said sources. Both systems will generate challans. It will be automatic, with a web interface to verify the alerts. From there, it will be connected to the existing RTO website to generate challans and send SMS notification to riders,” said an officer.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-plan-ai-cover-to-identify-prosecute-helmetless-riders-no-parking-rule-violators/articleshow/87968366.cms

2021-11-05,Pune municipal corporation to use AI to resolve garbage dumping in open,TNN,"PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation ( PMC ) plans to use artificial intelligence to resolve civic issues. The Pune civic administration has carried out a pilot project to deal with problems like dumping of garbage at Yerawada. The civic body has identified 150 public spots, where dumping is rampant. The civic body intends to fine errant citizens defacing public places using AI. Officials said that the civic body plans to use data analytics, AI, machine learning (ML), satellite imagery and e-governance to regularise property tax, illegal constructions etc. Kunal Khemnar, additional commissioner, PMC, said that the chronic spots would be identified using technology. Mitigation programmes would be carried out after that. “The civic administration plans to use mechanised sweeping machines at chronic spots. The aim is to reduce human intervention in garbage collection and disposal,” said Khemnar. He said that a software has been developed for keeping a watch on garbage disposal. The spots identified using satellite images would be cross-verified by staffers. “Even if garbage dumping does not stop after repeated cleaning, action will be taken against those throwing trash. The offenders will be identified with the help of CCTV footages. They will be fined,” said a senior official. The PMC plans to take the help of technology to collect property tax. The municipal corporation expects to collect more tax from 15 ward offices. Even properties out of the tax ambit will be added into the tax net using technology.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-to-use-ai-to-resolve-garbage-dumping-in-open/articleshow/87529362.cms
2021-11-05,"AI is transforming X-rays, MRIs, says Philips exec","Nov 5, 2021, 03:36 IST","Bengaluru: Smartphones today enable ordinary users to take the kinds of pictures that were previously possibly only by experts using DSLR cameras. They use powerful AI processors that are able to quickly and automatically recognise different objects in the frame, and apply specific camera settings tailored to the subject matter. They improve images by reducing motion blur, adding simulated depth of field, and improving colour, contrast and light range. Similar techniques are now being used in X-rays and MRI scans, so that even less trained or untrained medical staff can take these images, do them faster, and enable a machine to be used for more people in a day. That’s some of the cutting edge work that the Philips Innovation Campus (PIC) in Bengaluru, which just completed 25 years, is currently involved in. “MRIs can be so claustrophobic. Now think about a scenario where these scans can be performed 50% faster, with the same image quality. That is the power that AI brings,” says Kalavathi G V , head of PIC . MRIs often require patients to hold their breath, but that’s not easy for those with vascular issues. The AI systems enable shorter breath holds. Kalavathi says the software predicts if something is going to go wrong with the scan, enabling quick corrections. Similarly, PIC has helped develop what Philips calls the Radiology Smart Assistant , an AI-based solution that improves acquisition accuracy and reduces operational inefficiencies in X-ray through constant feedback at the point of image acquisition. “If the technician is not experienced, he might not get the image in the right way. Because of AI, it has changed the way you scan,” Kalavathi says. “It has reduced the time, reduced the stress, and reduced the costs.” The Bengaluru research team also optimised the processing speed and performance of what’s called B-line detection algorithms on smaller ultrasound devices that are used at the bedside. B-lines in ultrasound images are an indication for many diseases/conditions including pneumonia, pleural effusions, and bronchiolitis. The traditional way is for the user to perform the scan and interpret the images. This needs expertise. But with AI-based algorithms, the identification and quantification of B-Lines is made easier. Kalavathi says PIC, which now has 4,500 people, has established itself as a very strong software powerhouse for Philips, and has over the past few years been increasingly shifting gears to becoming an end-to-end digital solutions leader for the Dutch company. “It goes with the solution transformation that we are driving at Philips. When you make products, you sell it to the customer, it is more of a transaction. But when you talk about a solution, you become one with the customer. The customer is at the centre of everything that we do, we call it the need seeker mindset, that is the mindset that we are trying to change across the board. This involves starting from understanding the customer pain points to co-creating the solution,” she says. A successful solution developed is what’s called Mobile Obstetrics Monitoring ( MOM ). It’s a software solution that allows community healthcare workers to perform antenatal risk stratification and assess a patient’s pregnancy progress via a mobile device. “It is an intelligent algorithm in the mobile. We did a pilot in Shorapur taluk in Yadgir district in Karnataka in 2017. Over 1,500 pregnant women were enrolled. The mortality rate was very high in the district, but by using this solution, we were able to achieve zero maternal mortality,” Kalavathi says, adding that they are in talks with the government to scale it up.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ai-is-transforming-x-rays-mris-says-philips-exec/articleshow/87530400.cms

2021-10-31,‘Robotic surgery will work wonders in cancer treatment’,Chaitanya Deshpande,"Cancer has been one of the most enigmatic topics in the field of health care. Most of us know cancer as a dreadful disease. But there’s a lot more that we should know about it, especially about the advancements in treatment, including the latest, ‘robotic surgery’, and its next step, ‘Artificial intelligence. In an interview with TOI, Dr Abhinav Yashwant Deshpande, a well-known surgeon, who has specialized in surgical oncology and robotic surgery, shares his experience and knowledge about cancer treatment as October is observed all over the world as the ‘Breast Cancer Awareness Month’. Excerpts... Q. What’s the current cancer scenario in India? A: Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the entire world. According to WHO, one in six deaths globally is because of cancer. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research, in India, one woman dies of cervical cancer every 8 minutes. For every two females diagnosed with breast cancer, one woman dies in India. Due to tobacco, more than 3,500 people are affected in India every day. By 2025, there will be more than 15 lakh cancer cases, which means 1 out of 10 Indians will suffer from the disease and 1 out of 15 will lose the battle. But the positive part is that if we are aware and receive treatment early, cancer can be treated. Q. October is known as the ‘Breast Cancer Awareness Month’. Why is the disease on the rise? A. There are many factors that lead to certain types of cancers. These factors can be divided into three types — vulnerable factors, contributing factors and direct factors. Taking the example of breast cancer, the vulnerable factors can be early menses or late menopause while contributing factors can be lack of exercise, excess alcoholism, injection of pesticide or chemicals. The direct factors are radiation and inherent mutations (If the genes are present, they can be considered as direct factors). These are the various factors that increase the chances of breast cancer in women. Q. Are there any tests to determine whether a person is at risk of a particular cancer? A. Knowing the basic cause of cancer or knowing how to identify the basic symptoms can save lives. For example, if your immediate relatives have cancer or many people from one side of the family have some type of cancer, consult a doctor for genetic counselling. Self-examination in case of breast cancer or even pap-smear test for cervical cancer should be encouraged after a certain age. Robotic surgery, personalized oncology, immune therapy, liquid biopsy and many more advancements in cancer treatment are boosting the self-esteem of patients. Q. What is robotic surgery all about? A. There are three important treatments for cancer. Medical oncology is treating cancer through medical processes like chemotherapy. Radiation oncology involves radiation therapy to target cancer tumours. Finally, surgical oncology deals with the surgical aspects like ‘How do you remove cancer from the body through operations?’ This process takes care of the parts affected by cancer as well as the potential organs where the disease might spread. It needs better vision, greater precision, improved dexterity, and tremor filtration. Robotic surgery has all these plus points. Q. If the robot performs the surgery, then what does the surgeon do? A. A lot of scepticism as well as apprehension loomed over this very concept of the introduction of an alien hand for dealing with human life. But we must understand that robotic surgery is performed on the concept of master-slave. The robot follows the directions of the surgeon. Ultimately, human intelligence is using the special abilities of the machine but with full control over it. The robot can show the 3D view/high definition image with depth perception to the surgeon. It gives a 360-degree view, ensures intuitive movements, the robotic hand can move 7 degrees more than a human hand. A robotic surgery has many such advantages. Q. What are the advantages of robotic surgery? A. Less blood loss during the procedure, decreased hospital stay, less painful surgery, smaller scars, better cosmesis, better dissection and retrieval for cancer patients and shorter post-operative recovery are some big benefits. The patient may resume work early. These are some patient-specific benefits. Q. How does the cost factor work in robotic surgery and is it covered under health insurance? A. The cost issue is important. Robotic technology can lead to increase in cost because doctors have to pay not only for the one-time cost of robots but also for the maintenance of technology. But the cost will reduce in the coming days as the technology will get more acceptance. We have very few trained robotic surgeons in Central India. Very few hospitals have robots. It’s a thing of the future and we must accept it. Q. What is the future of robotic surgery? A. Robotic surgery is evolving. It is here to stay. The time has come to welcome this new technology with open arms and open minds. The present incorporated technologies have definitely channelized the zeal and enthusiasm towards lesser interventions with maximum benefits. Another exciting branch, which is the extension of the current advancements is artificial intelligence. The coming years would solve the enigma surrounding AI. A lot of excitement and optimism surrounding robotics would eventually unfold in the future.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/robotic-surgery-will-work-wonders-in-cancer-treatment/articleshow/87408036.cms

2021-10-20,Can civil engg prof teach AI? Old hands pushed to teach new tech,Preeti Biswas,"Hyderabad: Skewed demand for core engineering courses due to introduction of emerging technology courses has hit the faculty members from disciplines such as mechanical, electronics and electrical hard. Faculty are now compelled to upgrade their expertise to teach computer science engineering (CSE) related courses. This year, the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad (JNTUH) gave a big push to emerging technology courses by adding additional number of seats to accommodate the growing demand. Niche courses such as those within the CSE streams such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, data sciences were some courses introduced. “We are being asked to undergo various development programmes for emerging technology to be able to teach computer science students. Colleges are not keen to continue courses in core disciplines and are instead focusing only on computer science branch,” said a faculty member from a private engineering college in Medchal. Teachers rued that colleges have introduced courses without evaluating the number of faculty they have to teach them. “Due to this, many are now building pressure on faculty members from core disciplines to upgrade their skill-set for AI , ML, data sciences and other emerging technologies. In some colleges, teachers are being asked to leave on grounds that there is no demand for them,” said Aineni Santhosh Kumar, president of Telangana Schools Technical Colleges Employees Association. However, JNTUH officials say that faculty members should look at it in a positive way. “Today, even in mechanical engineering, there are additional courses such as 3D printing, additive manufacturing that come under emerging technology. Various sectors are transforming and adopting AI/ML. The idea to upgrade the faculty members is not to let pull down core disciplines but to equip faculty members with additional skills as per industry demands,” said JNTUH registrar, Manzoor Hussain.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/can-civil-engg-prof-teach-ai-old-hands-pushed-to-teach-new-tech/articleshow/87144670.cms

2021-10-04,Compact cars to get fancy with AI features,Nandini Sen Gupta,"Chennai: Remember the time when your small car’s bells and whistles comprised power windows, power steering, keyless entry and the AC? All that may soon become history as the next-gen compact models under development vie for top-of-the-line AI driven driver assist and connected car features that are currently available in the soon-to-launch premium SUVs like the MG Astor and Mahindra XUV700. These SUV-type features include AI-driven programs like driver drowsiness assist, camera and sensor-assisted lane driving, personalised cockpits, connectivity through smartphones and smartwatches for a bouquet of entertainment and information features. According to tier-1 drivetrain and component major Bosch, these features have now attracted the interest of the mass market small car companies that are developing their next generation models as well. “There are enquiries in the B-segment space and there are concepts being worked on as companies try to match the aspiration for ride experience with the willingness to pay for features like this. The head start in the market has been in the UV1 and UV3 segment (SUVs priced under Rs 15 lakh) where we are seeing clear traction so they are the pilots for these technologies,” said Sandeep N, executive director & head of sales-mobility solutions, Bosch Ltd. Auto industry sources said Suzuki and Toyota’s next geneartion under development models are among those looking at features like these. “The technology will see rapid proliferation because it has become very cheap so in the next generation of compact models many of these features will be added on. Already these features have become quite common in compact cars in Europe,” said automotive expert Hormazd Sorabjee. Industry insiders say the proliferation of these new-age features will go from B-segment compact SUVs down to the more mass market hatchback cars. “OEMs are already offering some connected features through mobile phone apps like locking-unlocking, light beam and horn adjustment, geo and time zoning etc. These features are now on offer in B-segment sub-4 metre SUVs like Nissan Magnite, Hyundai Venue or Tata Nexon but the penetration of ADAS features like advanced lane assist or driver monitoring are still low. Indian customers value connected features more,” said Ravi Bhatia, president JATO Dynamics. According to Bhatia, the features currently being adopted include adaptive cruise control, automatic parking, automotive head-up display, blind spot monitor, driver monitoring system, forward collision warning, lane centering and lane change assistance, automatic emergency braking and brake assist system and traffic sign recognition systems. “So far only XUV700 and Astor qualify for Autonomous Level-2 features but sub-Rs 20 lakh cars like the Kia Seltos already offer driver assist features like the overtaking sensor,” he said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/compact-cars-to-get-fancy-with-ai-features/articleshow/86736577.cms

2021-09-20,"Tamil Nadu: Engineering colleges seek to cash in on demand, up intake in AI & data sciences by 100%",A Ragu Raman,"CHENNAI: In an effort to cash in on the current craze and to arrest falling admissions, engineering colleges in Tamil Nadu have increased their intake for B Tech (AI and data science) by more than 100%, from 2,732 seats in 2020-21 to 6,000 in 2021-22. The number of colleges offering this course also increased from 50 last year to 106 this year, taking the subject to tier-II institutions in rural areas. Colleges say the course is the second most preferred this year after computer science engineering. Professors from Anna University say faculty members and students in colleges need to be trained by industry experts, adding that the market could otherwise be flooded with untrained graduates as colleges start the course as an additional branch to computer science with a 70% similar syllabus. TOI spoke to experts to shed more light about the relatively new course and the job opportunities for those choosing it. “Data science is an interdisciplinary subject combining statistics and computing with a strong foundation in mathematics,” said Madhavan Mukund, director of Chennai Mathematical Institute. On the one hand, business schools focusing on case studies and data visualization treat mathematical analysis largely as a black box, he said. “On the other, more technically focused programmes that have grown out of statistics or engineering departments tend to offer limited offerings without always doing justice to all aspects of the subject.” The most effective data science programmes are those combining faculty expertise across statistics, computing and mathematics, along with the industry context through continuous engagement with industry,” Mukund said. Industry experts say the need for data scientists and data analysts will continue even post pandemic due to the digital transformation that is happening. “In the next few years, one tenth of the workforce in the IT services industry will become data scientists,” said Venkatesh D K, senior vice-president and global delivery head (healthcare and life sciences) Virtusa Consulting Services. Engineering colleges say the demand for computer science engineering has also increased. “Of every 10 management quota applications received, nine gave computer science as the first choice,” said R M Kishore, vice-chairman of RMK Engineering College. The next in preference were AI and data science, information technology and electronics and communication engineering. “Last year, 65% of computer science seats, 63% of AI seats and 71% of IT seats were filled. In civil engineering, only 23% seats were filled,” said career consultant Jayaprakash Gandhi, adding that the trend is the same this year.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-engineering-colleges-seek-to-cash-in-on-demand-up-intake-in-ai-data-sciences-by-100/articleshow/86357869.cms
2021-09-19,"The scientist and the AI-assisted, remote-control killing machine",Ronen Bergman&Farnaz Fassihi,"Iran's top nuclear scientist woke up an hour before dawn, as he did most days. That afternoon, he and his wife would leave their vacation home on the Caspian Sea and drive to their country house in Absard, east of Tehran. Convinced that Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was leading Iran's efforts to build a nuclear bomb, Israel had wanted to kill him for at least 14 years. Iran's intelligence had warned Fakhrizadeh of a possible assassination plot, but the scientist had brushed it off. So shortly after noon on November 27, he slipped behind the wheel of his black Nissan Teana sedan along with his wife and hit the road. An elusive target Since 2004, when the Israeli government ordered its foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad, to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, the agency had been methodically picking off experts thought to be part of Iran's nuclear weapons programme. Despite several assassination bids, Fakhrizadeh was elusive. So, they decided to try something new. Iranian agents working for the Mossad had parked a Nissan Zamyad pickup truck on the side of the road connecting Absard to the main highway. Hidden beneath tarpaulins in the truck bed was a 7.62-mm sniper machine gun. Around 1pm, the hit team got a signal that Fakhrizadeh, his wife and a team of armed guards in escort cars were about to leave for Absard. The assassin, a skilled sniper, took up his position. He was nowhere near Absard, however. He was peering into a computer screen at an undisclosed location over 1,000 miles away. Reports of a killing The reports from Iran were confusing, contradictory and mostly wrong. While one reported about a team of assassins, another said a truck had exploded. A few days later, several Iranian news oufits reported that the assassin was a killer robot. Iranians mocked the story, except this time there really was a killer robot. The straight-out-of-science-fiction story of what really happened, published on NYT for the first time, is based on interviews with US, Israeli and Iranian officials, including two intelligence officials, and his family's statements to media. The operation's success was the debut test of a high-tech, computerised sharpshooter kitted out with artificial intelligence and multiple-camera eyes, operated via satellite and capable of firing 600 rounds a minute. Time was running out Preparations for the assassination began toward the end of 2019 and in early 2020 between Israeli officials, led by the Mossad director, Yossi Cohen, and high-ranking US officials, including President Donald Trump, secretary of state Mike Pompeo and the CIA director, Gina Haspel. Israel had paused the sabotage and assassination campaign in 2012, when the US began talks with Iran leading to the 2015 nuclear deal. Now that Trump had abrogated that agreement, the Israelis wanted to resume the campaign. In late February 2020, Cohen presented the Americans with a list of potential operations, including the killing of Fakhrizadeh. The US officials briefed about the assassination plan in Washington supported it, according to an official who was at the meeting. Both countries were encouraged by Iran's relatively tepid response to the US assassination of Iran's military commander Qassim Suleimani in January 2020. By the summer, it looked as if Trump could lose the US election. His likely successor, Joe Biden, had promised to reverse Trump's policies and return to the 2015 deal. If Israel was going to kill a top Iranian official, an act that could start a war, it needed the assent and protection of the US. That meant acting before Biden could take office. Programming a hit Israel chose a special model of a Belgian-made FN MAG machine gun attached to an advanced robotic apparatus, according to an intelligence official familiar with the plot. But the machine gun, the robot, its components and accessories together weigh about a tonne. So the equipment was broken down and smuggled into the country piece by piece and then secretly reassembled in Iran. The robot was built to fit in the bed of the Zamyad pickup. Cameras pointing in multiple directions were mounted on the truck to give the command room a full picture. Finally, the truck was packed with explosives so it could be blown to bits after the kill. The AI was programmed to compensate for delay, the truck's shake and the scientist's car's speed. Another challenge was to determine that it was Fakhrizadeh in the car. So, a decoy car with a camera to force a U-turn and get a clear image was stationed. The strike Shortly before 3.30pm, the motorcade arrived at the U-turn. Fakhrizadeh's car came to a near halt, and he was positively identified. The machine gun fired a burst of bullets. It is not clear if these shots hit Fakhrizadeh but the car swerved and came to a stop. The shooter adjusted the sights and fired another burst, hitting the windshield at least three times and Fakhrizadeh at least once in the shoulder. The scientist stepped out of the car and crouched behind the open front door. According to Iran's Fars News, three more bullets tore into his spine and he collapsed. The attack was precise, sparing Fakhrizadeh's wife. The Zamyad truck exploded as intended so that no one could piece together what had happened. However, most of the robot equipment remained largely intact. The Iran Revolutionary Guards' assessment - that the attack was carried out by a remote-controlled machine gun ""equipped with an intelligent satellite system"" using AI - was correct. The operation took less than a minute. Fifteen bullets were fired. The weapon now joins in the arsenal of high-tech weapons for remote targeted killing and might just point to the future of espionage.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/the-scientist-and-the-ai-assisted-remote-control-killing-machine/articleshow/86333523.cms

The International Institute of Information Technology-Hyderabad (IIIT-H) along with tech giant Intel , NMC (Nagpur Municipal Corporation) and CSIR-Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), among other partners, have launched project iRASTE (intelligent Solutions for Road Safety through Technology and Engineering) in Nagpur. As part of this project, the partners will be leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to reduce road accident incidents by around 50% in Nagpur city in the next two years and create a model that can be scaled up and replicated in the entire country, Nivruti Rai, country head, Intel India and vice-president, Intel Foundry Services, said on Monday. iRASTE will focus on three key aspects -- vehicle safety, mobility analysis and road infrastructure safety. Under this project, NMC’s fleet of vehicles will be equipped with collision avoidance system, a subset of Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS), that can reduce accidents and near misses by up to 60%. Currently, around 30 buses in Nagpur have been fitted with such devices and this will be scaled up to around 350 in coming days. These sensors will also help map current accident-prone areas as well as the likely accident zones in the entire road network, helping road maintenance agencies to intervene at an early stage and go for preventive maintenance. Shekhar C Mande, DG, CSIR, said, “CSIR-Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) will help in identifying the accident-prone locations and also evaluate the drivers’ behaviour before and after installation of collision avoidance systems in their vehicles. This project can be emulated in different cities as well.” While Intel India will bring its ADAS technology, CRRI will leverage its domain expertise in road engineering and IIIT-Hyderabad will be undertaking AI-based research to address population-scale road safety through its INAI center for applied AI research.

2021-09-03,IIT-Indore using AI to develop network to detect fires in Melghat Tiger Reserve,Vijay Pinjarkar,"Nagpur: With forest fires a major cause of concern, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Indore is working on a pilot project to develop a wireless sensor network (WSN) with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) tools to detect forest fires in Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR) in Amravati district. AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. A WSN network is a group of specialized sensors with a communications infrastructure for monitoring and recording conditions at diverse locations. The project is the brainchild of Dr Abhishek Srivastava, associate professor with the department of computer science and engineering. He said, “Our team is working on putting together a sophisticated surveillance system harnessing machine learning to more effectively detect forest fires.” “The approach involves deployment of WSN motes (remote devices) laden with sensors to detect fires. Forest fires are a great cause of destruction in the wild, often leading to a loss of flora and fauna, and forcing the displacement of the local population,” said Srivastava. It was during a casual chat with a friend working for conservation in Melghat that the idea evolved and Dr Srivastava came to know how these fires are detected. Maharashtra is vulnerable to forest fires. As reported by TOI on June 18, 2021, of the over 3.86 lakh fire alerts issued nationally by the Forest Survey of India (FSI) based on satellite data, Maharashtra recorded 60,851 alerts, which comes to 16% of the total incidents in the country. As per FSI data, there was a record number of fires between January and May as compared to the last two years. Most of these fires reported in April and May were man-made and ignited for mahua and tendu leaves collection. “The task is fully reliant on a manual effort by forest officials and field staff who go for long walks, and in the absence of any connectivity, run back to inform of a mishap, taking a long time to extinguish fires. Moreover, Melghat’s rugged terrain makes fighting fires a Herculean task,” says Srivastava. “We worked on the WSN technology but the main issue with such WSN deployments is that they are frequently prone to false positives. For example, the heat sensor of a mote may be stimulated by the rays of the sun on a particularly hot summer day, and this may be misconstrued to be a fire,” said Srivastava. “The humidity sensor may falsely assume a fire on a humid day. To overcome such scenarios, the idea is to appropriately train machine learning algorithms to minimize incidents of false positives,” he said. The norm is to deploy such algorithms on the back-end cloud with infinite resources and send back signals from individual sensors for decision-making. Given the energy-starved environment of a dense forest like Melghat, however, doing this is impracticable. The team, therefore, is working on developing extremely ‘lean’ machine learning algorithms that can be deployed on the resource-constrained WSN motes, and are capable of correctly detecting forest fires. Lean algorithms for classification, anomaly detection, and localization have already been developed and deployed on a pilot WSN network within the IIT, Indore, campus. Deployment and testing of these algorithms at the Melghat Tiger Reserve will be conducted once the pandemic restrictions are completely lifted. “We will talk to forest officials before taking up the project,” he said. The project is designed by Dr Srivastava along with his collaborator at the University of Alberta, Dr Osmar Zaiane, and their team of students comprising Arun Kumar, Ankit Jain, Prarthi Jain, Uttkarsh Aggarwal, and Seemandhar Jain.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/iit-indore-using-ai-to-develop-network-to-detect-fires-in-melghat-tiger-reserve/articleshow/85877519.cms

2021-08-02,Can AI speed up disposal of cases? Verdict awaited,Swati Deshpande,"Supreme Court MUMBAI: The Supreme Court recently unveiled a tool named SUPACE ( Supreme Court Portal for Assistance in Court Efficiency), an Artificial Intelligence-based portal to assist judges with research. Make no mistake, it is not designed to take a decision, only to process facts and provide inputs to enable decision-making by judges. But it has opened up a debate of sorts on how much AI can be used to dispense justice. “The core job of a judge is judging. That cannot be outsourced,’’ said former Supreme Court judge B N Srikrishna. Nuances of judging a person’s state of mind are beyond a bot, said jurists. Senior counsel Amit Desai added that AI could be used in cases of a repetitive nature that fit a strict pattern such as bouncing of cheques, civil violations or drunk driving. “Judicial work cannot be handed over to a machine, even one with AI or programmed to read and understand law,” said Justice Srikrishna. But pre-judicial work, such as case management, random allocation of matters to benches, case-law indexing and analysis, administrative work linked to a court can lean on AI to streamline and reduce pendency, he added. Other legal experts concur. “Judging involves human emotions too. No scientific tool has any moral issue attached to it,” said Justice Srikrishna who helmed the study for India’s data protection policy. “AI has not been programmed to delve into human emotions.” AI as a tool to judge matters is “debatable” agreed, senior counsel Amit Desai. But he said it could be used in “summary trials, strict liability cases and cases of a repetitive nature like negotiable instrument (cheque bouncing) prosecutions, since AI has abilities to identify fact patterns easily and compare them with precedents.” Even “traffic violations and drunken driving cases or some civic violations can be dealt with by AI.” The former Chief Justice of India, SA Bobde , in his opening remarks after becoming CJI , had spoken of bringing AI into the system. Desai adds, “However matters involving judging the state of mind ( mens rea ) and cases of complex fact patterns are matters best left to human judging since justice also includes the human element of discretion. But in such cases as a tool to collate and analysis case law it will be very useful. It will have enormous use at the administrative level and significantly reduce time lines in justice delivery."" Justice Madan Lokur, former Supreme Court Judge who headed the e-committee for six years prior to his retirement in 2018, say there are several question that first need to be asked and then answered including, “the big question. what is it that is sought to be achieved via AI?’’ He says, “It cannot be to dispense with Judges and Judging. Especially not in criminal case, AI can never replace Judges.’’ Last year during the ongoing Covid pandemic, SC Justice D Y Chandrachud who heads the SC e-committee had said virtual or online hearing of matters via VC is a way Judiciary telling citizens it values their time. At the launch of e-projects of Kerala high court, Justice Chandrachud had suggested using AI and the Integrated criminal justice system to translate contents of FIRs from a local language to the court language. Hence, thought there is a new tool in town, but the buzz around AI to dispense justice is still a buzz and won’t dispense with Justices, said jurists. In the US: AI in the US Judicial system is used by some county courts for visual or facial recognition to sign into court systems. A report of March 2020 by the Joint Technology Committee in the US called, “introduction to AI for Courts’ speaks of use of ‘Natural language processing (NLP) used by various digital assistant in a “conversational interface to extract meaning from human speech.’’ The applications like chatbots may be a result then. “The New Jersey court’s chat bot leverages AI to respond to increasingly complex questions,’’ said the JTC report. It adds there could be application of ‘symbolic AI’ which “closely reflects classic legal reasoning’’ in two steps; write down all rules, then apply relevant rules to facts to find a solution. Legal navigator websites in Florida and Colorado are leaning on them for senior citizens.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-can-ai-speed-up-disposal-of-cases-verdict-awaited/articleshow/84959302.cms

2021-07-21,Anarock deploys AI-powered platform for digital marketing,Shiladitya Pandit,"Pune: Property consultancy firm Anarock is launching ASTRA, an AI and machine learning-powered platform, to help in digital marketing for mid- and large-size property developers, with a rollout planned for September. Anarock will initially use the platform for its clients marketing needs, with a subscription-based model for its “pro” customers with additional benefits. The platform was developed over two years with its analytics partners. Anarock has started onboarding its clients ahead of the September rollout. A spokesperson for Anarock explained that developers can feed their own data about their projects into ASTRA, which will be matched with the most “likely” leads generated online for housing units from buyers. The leads will be based on data collected through various means, and observation of buyers’ needs and behaviour, such as spending patterns and power, size and location of the apartment needed, etc. The data, according to the spokesperson, will help sell units across all segments, but on the supply side, it will be of most help to larger developers, especially those with unsold inventory of Rs 100 crore and above, for adequate ROI. “Developers retain complete control of their data. The system does not require customer contact details to analyse leads. Rather, it crunches data of micro-market catchment dynamics, local price sensitivity, historic sales trends, and the impact of upcoming infrastructure and local policies,” said Gurpreet Singh, director of G-Square, Anarock’s data analytics partner. The developers of ASTRA said that the platform can help realtors increase their sales by up to 15%. “We began developing the ASTRA Artificial Intelligence models in 2019, configuring multiple models across different types of real estate projects across India. Now in its final development stage, ASTRA will give developers a 20-fold return on their investment in this AI-driven platform,” said Anuj Puri, the chairman of Anarock.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/anarock-deploys-ai-powered-platform-for-digital-marketing/articleshow/84597068.cms
2021-07-16,"Court verdict in a jiffy? AI could be answer, says IIT Kanpur research",Hemali Chhapia,"IIT Kanpur (File photo) MUMBAI: Can a judgment be delivered in seconds? An IIT Kanpur ’s research paper says artificial intelligence could be the answer. A team of researchers led by Ashutosh Modi and Arnab Bhattacharya at IIT-K’s computer science department developed a system that not only predicts what should be the final decision of a court case, but also how one arrives at that decision. An AI-enabled automated system that can assist judges by suggesting outcome of an ongoing court case may help in expediting the judicial process. For this, they have created a new corpus of 35,000 legal documents from the Supreme Court (SC): the Indian Legal Documents Corpus (ILDC). The research paper titled ‘Indian Legal Documents Corpus based Court Judgment Prediction and Explanation (CJPE)’ states that the advent of AI-enabled technology brings “hope to the legal system”. “This is one of the first Indian Legal Corpus of SC cases created for case prediction and explanation. Moreover, this is an ongoing process and the corpus is being actively built. The ILDC is created and annotated with court decisions. A portion of the corpus (a separate test set) is annotated with gold standard explanations by legal experts,” said Arnab Bhattacharya, professor of computer science at IITK. “The next step is Court Judgement Prediction, for this specialized deep learning-based models are developed. Prediction is followed by an explanation for the decision, using unsupervised algorithms. Explanations given by the algorithm are compared with the explanations annotated by legal experts.” This research was done by including professor Kripa Ghosh from Indian Institute of Science Education and Research-Kolkata and Shouvik Guha, a law professor from West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences as part of the team and it highlights how symbiosis between legal experts and AI researchers could develop practical solutions for the legal system of India. For the record, the National Judicial Data Grid states, there are 5.75 million cases pending in the high courts and 38.15 million in the district courts across India. Of these, more than 4.5 million cases have been pending for more than 10 years. “The goal of this model is to assist the legal community and not replace judges. The AI model can augment the process and bring about faster decision making, allowing for clearing up cases,” added Bhattacharya.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/court-verdict-in-a-jiffy-ai-could-be-answer-says-iit-k-research/articleshow/84459562.cms

He, along with four other students from different parts of the world, worked on a project titled ‘bias in AI systems and applications’ over a period of 10 weeks. As part of the challenge, the team had to develop solutions to address AI bias issues for one or more AI systems and applications. The solution can include innovations and/or alterations of existing technology and data collected from online open sources. Gurijala, along with four other students from different parts of the world, worked on a project titled ‘bias in AI systems and applications’ over a period of 10 weeks With AI systems recognizing patterns in datasets, biases in the datasets may be reflected on AI models as well. In many cases, the biased decisions made will have a high impact (for example, choosing whether a person will be hired or not). The team suggested that bias must be eliminated in order for AI models to make fair decisions. “As part of the team, I interviewed a professor in Virginia Tech for AI and took up surveys that were circulated among people engaged in AI. Our team came up with solutions that can give a holistic plan to weed out biases in AI systems and applications,” said Gurijala. The team came up with three primary solutions – bias measuring and mitigation platform, decentralised database and a guidebook that will enable developers and organisations to recognise implicit bias. As a reward, the team members will be given access to courses in New York University .

2021-06-26,AI-driven model helps get quick diagnosis of virus: KMIT,Preeti Biswas,"HYDERABAD: With CT scans emerging as an alternative for early detection of Covid-19, a group of researchers has come up with deep learning models that can assist radiologists for faster and more accurate diagnosis of the virus. With several new Covid-19 variants coming into the picture, CT images are excessively used to identify the virus. Increased bandwidth of CT images consumes a lot of time, resulting in substantial increase in workload of the radiologists. Now, using machine learning and artificial intelligence, researchers from Keshav Memorial Institute of Technology (KMIT) have developed models that can automatically identify Covid-19 regions on CT images. This may significantly reduce the workload of radiologists, KMIT professors said. As part of the research, published in the ‘European Journal of Molecular & Clinical Medicine’, the researchers collected and analysed global dataset of 1,000 CT images that were available in the public domain. “By combining AI-driven computer-aided diagnostic system (CADS), we can improve and assist radiologists for quick, accurate and unbiased diagnosis. We feed the data into the system and train it for three primary models -- automatic lung segmentation, binary classification of Covid-19 and Covid-19 region segmentation,” said Rajasekaran Subramaniam, professor, R&D department, KMIT. He said the proposed deep learning models produce an accuracy of 97 per cent, 98 per cent and 99 per cent respectively. Deep learning models automatically learn the features of Covid-19 from the expert (radiologist) annotated Covid-19 CT images and predicts Covid-19 regions by using the learned features of the model. “Now, we are working on android/mobile version of this system with Indian patients’ data. This mobile version will enable a complete system, with user login, image upload and prediction results sent to user mobile, which can be viewed on a computer by anybody,” said R Devika Rubi, principal investigator of the model and associate professor, R&D department, KMIT.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ai-driven-model-helps-get-quick-diagnosis-of-virus-kmit/articleshow/83856957.cms

2021-06-01,"ICICI Lombard steps up on AI, deploys Microsoft’s speech services",Mayur Shetty,"Mumbai: ICICI Lombard General Insurance is working towards using Microsoft ’s speech-to-text tools as a stepping stone to build up artificial intelligence ( AI ) capability in dealing with customers. The company has now deployed Azure Speech Services and Natural Language Processing in its outward call centres to automate supervision of calls. The longer-term goal is to use these conversations to teach its artificial intelligence systems so that they have the capability of facing customers directly in future. The company has already tasted success in using image recognition under Microsoft’s Azure Cognitive Services in assessing claims. It now aims to make further use of the cloud-based platform. According to ICICI Lombard chief technology office Girish Nayak , the company does around 10,000 outbound calls a day. Earlier, it used to manually screen 20% of the calls to check compliance and quality of its tele-customer services. “For much of the technology that we have deployed, the true value has come out now because of the lockdown situation as it has helped in the last mile reach,” said Nayak. Acknowledging that ICICI Lombard has been a frontrunner in deployment of the software giants cognitive services, Microsoft national technology officer Rohini Srivathsa said that the insurer has shown ingenuity in adopting technology from a platform and customising it at two levels — first for the non-life industry where everyday words like ‘cover’ and ‘claim’ hold different meanings and then for Indian ‘Hinglish’ where two languages are used in the same sentence. According to Srivathsa, ICICI Lombard will have access to all the research and development (R&D) that is happening at Microsoft in developing its voice agent Cortana. “The core technologies as they advance, the advancement will go into any of the customers using the models. For Indian languages, there is a mixing of language, the structural difference of Indian language is also captured,” she said. While banking finance insurance are ahead of game in the digitisation journey, the technology can be used by any industry that has high customer-facing or high customer interaction, said Srivathsa. “Around 2017-18 we started experimenting with the AI/ML piece on Azure. We used image recognition to identify damages on vehicles to come up with break-in solutions. We are running models where it can not just figure whether there is damage, but it can also assess the damage and ascertain whether it needs repair or replacement and virtual run the entire claim process. We have used the Microsoft tools for fraud detection, It is a natural progression from AI,” said Nayak.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/icici-lombard-steps-up-on-ai-deploys-microsofts-speech-services/articleshow/83045462.cms

The device can prove to be a boon to prevent a large share of road crashes. This device, which was developed by one Colonel Kuldeep Yadav of Military College of Electronics and Mechanical Engineering (MCEME) at Secunderabad , has been tested in three army vehicles for three months. Lt General TSA Narayanan , Commandant at MCEME said the trial run has been very successful and this month they handed over one device to the Telangana government for trial on commercial vehicles. “We have got the IPR for this. We worked on this device to minimise the risk of accidents of our vehicles. The production of this device can be scaled up quickly. The current estimated price would be around Rs 10,000 for a device, but the cost will reduce once there is large scale production,” Narayanan told TOI. The AI-based Accident Prevention System is a small, economical and rugged device that can be mounted in the driver’s compartment. The system is designed to be adjustable and can be easily mounted on existing cars and trucks. With some design change the size can also be reduced. The power supply to the device is taken directly from the vehicle battery and can be used for long hours. It is also equipped to alert the vehicle owners through email. In a study carried out for the road transport ministry in 2019, one-fourth of drivers had admitted that they had fallen asleep behind the wheel while driving and this was more prevalent in the case of truck drivers. Another study by the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) on crashes on the 300-km Agra-Lucknow Expressway had also found that exhausted drivers who dozed off at the wheel were responsible for about 40% of such incidents. Now across the globe there has been more focus on using the AI and technology solutions to prevent crashes.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/now-ai-based-device-to-alert-drivers-when-they-doze-off/articleshow/82023123.cms

2021-04-07,"Now, judges can take help of artificial intelligence",Dhananjay Mahapatra,"NEW DELHI: Indian judiciary embarked on an “ambitious and pioneering” plan to allow judges to take assistance of artificial intelligence (AI) in deciding cases with Chief Justice S A Bobde on Tuesday launching a specially designed software which will assist judges by furnishing all relevant documents and records of a case at one click, The CJI , however, allayed apprehensions that the new technology will in any manner influence the outcome of a litigation as the “autonomy and discretion” of judges will remain intact with no interference from the software. Justice Bobde has advocated the use of AI in judicial work and has pushed for making the justice delivery system efficient through the help of technology. He said the software SUPACE ( Supreme Court Portal for Assistance in Courts Efficiency) is unique and is a perfect blend of human and machine intelligence. “We are not going to let the use of AI spill over to decision making. It will fully retain the autonomy and discretion of judges to decide cases, though at a much faster pace at which the readiness of information is made available by AI... I believe that an artificial intelligence system that decides the case could be disastrous to the judiciary,” the CJI said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/now-judges-can-take-help-of-artificial-intelligence/articleshow/81942409.cms
2021-03-26,"Former Google CEO gives $150 million for research in biology, AI",AP,"WASHINGTON: Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and his wife, Wendy, have given $150 million to a research institute to establish a “new era of biology” aimed at battling diseases with a mix of data and life science studies. The Massachusetts-based Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard will use the funds to build a new center that will bring together academia and industry to merge the two disciplines in an effort to make people healthier. “Until now, these fields have largely developed in parallel,” the Broad Institute said in a statement on Thursday. “Their convergence will create a new era of biology, one that is expected to yield a deep understanding of biological processes, with the ultimate aim of improving human health through more powerful disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.” Experts say the initiative sets a precedent for building more research centers that mix the two disciplines. “There is a huge need in the biology field to bring in computational and data science expertise,” said Peng Qiu, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who studies the subject, adding, the need for integrating the two fields “has been well recognized in the research community.” The endowment gift is the largest donation the couple has given through Schmidt Futures, their latest philanthropic initiative focusing on science and technology. The Schmidts have other philanthropic arms, including their family foundation, and are ranked as one of the top donors in the United States. The institute said Thursday that it also received an additional $150 million contribution from the Broad Foundation, the charity founded by philanthropists Eli and Edythe L Broad. The couple helped create the institute in 2003, and their foundation has pledged more than $1 billion to the research facility. “Much like Eli and Edye Broad saw the potential in creating the Broad Institute, Wendy and I believe this center has the promise to create a new field of science that could benefit human health in ways we can't even begin to imagine,” Eric Schmidt, a member of the institute's board, said in the announcement. “The pandemic has shown us that prioritizing science, innovation, and research is one of the greatest investments we can make in our future,” he added. The center, which will be named after the Schmidts, will collaborate with experts from numerous fields at companies ranging from Google, Microsoft and AstraZeneca , and learning institutions including Oxford University and the Mayo Clinic. “Philanthropic gifts of this magnitude have the potential to be transformative in scientific discovery,"" said R Patrick Bixler, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin's RGK Center for Philanthropy and Community Service. He notes doing this work ""through a network of cross-sector partners will undoubtedly lead to breakthroughs in internal medicine and public health."" Schmidt served as Google's CEO from 2001 to 2011, a time of rapid growth for the California-based technology company. He later became executive chairman for Google, and in 2015, for its new parent company, Alphabet, before resigning as chairman in 2018.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/former-google-ceo-gives-150-million-for-research-in-biology-ai/articleshow/81695098.cms
2021-03-21,Indians use AI to bring pictures of dead kin to life,Sonam Joshi,"A new AI-powered technology called Deep Nostalgia that animates still photos of people took over social media recently Many used the software to animate photos of their loved ones, while others tried it out on historical figures such as Bhagat Singh , Kasturba Gandhi and Premchand , and even paintings and sculptures. Once users upload photos, the tool uses deep learning to animate them. These short soundless video simulations comprise gestures such as smiling, blinking and nodding. Over 10 million images have already been uploaded for Deep Nostalgia since its launch by genealogy website MyHeritage on February 25. Actor and director Roshan Abbas tried it on photos of his and his wife’s grandfathers. “When I showed it to my 81-year-old father, he was amazed, while my wife’s parents had tears in their eyes.” However, results can vary. Photographer and curator Anusha Yadav used the tool on multiple historical photos, including those of her late father. “It was an interesting trick, but I know that is not the way he looked or smiled,” says Yadav, who is the founder of the Indian Memory Project, which focuses on historical photos found in personal archives across the Indian subcontinent. Nathaniel Gaskell from the Museum of Art and Photography, Bengaluru, says one of the positives of this tech is that it conjures up a distant past, and brings it into the present. “It’s good if it’s making people engage with archival photos and helping bring history to life,” he says. “However, it also takes away the role that imagination plays when you look at still photos.” For many, the Deep Nostalgia images have evoked a mixture of wonder and dread. Technologist and writer Krish Ashok shared a coloured animation created from a black-and-white still photo of his father as a 16-year-old. “A lot of my family were stunned that it could bring people who have passed away to life for their grandchildren,” he says. “But this is one of those technologies that started out of what philosophers call ‘uncanny valley’, with reference to technologies that we find creepy when they get human but are not human enough.” He’s also wary of the ways in which the technology can be potentially misused. “It is sold as Deep Nostalgia, but it is deep fake. The fact that you can generate a video of someone simply from a still photo, imagine doing this to a political figure?” says Ashok. “As with most breakthrough technologies, this can clearly be weaponised given the world of misinformation we live in.” Yadav too adds a warning. “It is entertaining but there is a cost that it will be abused in the political arena and one should be prepared for that,” she says. Gaskell points to a need for visual literacy. “It is better that people understand that what they see is an interpretation.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/indians-use-ai-to-bring-pictures-of-dead-kin-to-life/articleshow/81608500.cms

2021-03-09,"IIIT-H, city defence unit on AI frontline to counter China threat",Swati Bharadwaj&Ch Sushil Rao,"Hyderabad: The Chinese armed forces are as prepared in cyber warfare as they are in fighting pitched battles on the ground. This is a reality that the Indian government is grappling with after the Galwan valley clash last year. Reports that Chinese hackers had attacked India’s power grid immediately after the clash are an indication of how the nature of war is changing, say experts. The Union government has since decided to beef up its digital attack and defence capabilities by introducing artificial intelligence (AI) in everything, from missiles to surveillance to shipbuilding. It is taking the help of academic institutions, such as the International Institute of Information Technology at Hyderabad ( IIIT-H ) and defence institutions such as the Secunderabad-based Military College of Electrical & Mechanical Engineering (MCEME). “We are seeing a lot of AI-related requests coming in after the Chinese incursion last year. I think India has realised that China is way ahead when it comes to AI and is trying to bridge this gap,” said Yalla Veera Prakash, head of technology transfer and product labs, IIIT-H. IIIT-H has already been working with defence public sector enterprises (PSEs) like Bharat Dynamics Ltd (BDL), Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) and GRSE (Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers) to integrate AI into defence capabilities, added prof Ramesh Loganathan, head of research outreach. IIIT-H not only houses a Centre of Excellence (CoE) for AI in missile technology that was set up in mid-2019 along with BDL, it has also been selected for the 25 Technology Innovation Hubs (TIH) by the National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber Physical Systems for developing and promoting data-driven technologies and AI & machine learning. Prakash said they are working on using computer vision and imaging to understand various battlefield scenarios with the help of data generated by surveillance cameras fitted onto tanks, warheads and drones. They are also looking at ways to autonomously detect mines and improve the ability to understand and detect targets, human or inanimate, using computer vision and machine learning. “They are now trying to garner an understanding of various objects, whether they are human or not, to figure out how far it is located, how fast its moving and how threatening or vulnerable it is,” he explained. They are also working on natural language processing and audio signal processing to decipher and translate eavesdropped radio signals of Chinese troops located 2 to 3 km away along the border. According to Prakash, the armed forces are also trying to add a lot of AI to the usage of night vision cameras and the data they generate. MCEME, which is a CoE for army equipment in AI and is also being developed as a hub of tech innovation for AI-related projects in the Indian army, too has been working on several projects using AI. These include AI-based accident prevention, automatically identifying humans from thermal camera feeds, automatically identifying targets from radar signals among other things, said MCEME officials.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iiit-h-city-defence-unit-on-ai-frontline-to-counter-china-threat/articleshow/81402028.cms

CJI Bobde was speaking after inaugurating the Centenary Building of Patna high court . “Litigation is fine, and making provisions for litigation is also fine, but it is time we resort to pre-litigation mediation,” the CJI said. He added, “Pre-litigation mediation is a way of solving problems in both civil and criminal cases, which arises from the same dispute. When that is done it makes a big difference not only to the feeling among litigants but also on pendency (of cases).” “I have been discussing this with the Union law minister. The only thing lacking with pre-litigation mediation is a law for the agreement on it. That is the essence of pre-litigation mediation,” the CJI said referring to Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad sitting on the dais with other dignitaries. CM Nitish Kumar, Supreme court Justices Navin Sinha, Indira Banerjee and Hemant Gupta, Patna high court Chief Justice Sanjay Karol with brother judge Shivaji Pandey were present during the programme. CJI Bobde further said heavy investment has been made in the utilization of technology to improve the efficiency of various processes involved in justice delivery systems such as video conferencing and artificial intelligence ( AI ). CJI also said AI is likely to change the face of the judiciary. He said decision-making would remain with judges but AI would result in a change in the speed with which inputs are obtained. “The system of AI which is about to be introduced, in no way is going to take away the discretion of judges in deciding a case but it is only the access of ease of information which will change,” he said while clearing apprehensions over AI. He urged Chief Justice Karol to ask CM that the state government allocates an additional budget for AI in Patna high court. He said the appearance of lawyers from across the country and even abroad via video conferencing has created ""problems"" and it can’t be brushed under the carpet. CJI Bobde also said inequality has been created amid lawyers due to virtual hearing as everyone does not have the required infrastructure for virtual hearings. “It must be removed by providing common facilities for such lawyers,” he said. “In time to come, less infrastructure for court buildings would be required as record rooms and other things might not be needed due to digitization,” he said in the backdrop of the newly inaugurated modern ‘Centenary Building’ of the Patna high court built at a cost of Rs 203 crore.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cji-bobde-bats-for-pre-litigation-mediation-ai/articleshow/81249375.cms
2021-02-17,Excerpt: 'Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power' by Rajiv Malhotra,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"With every passing year, humans become more dependent on technology. That has several advantages but also some dangers, which Rajiv Malhotra reveals in his book , ' Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power '. An internationally acclaimed author who has studied computer science and done extensive research on India's history, Rajiv Malhotra has interesting insights on what artificial intelligence is doing to our nation and how it will affect us in the future. He looks into how artificial intelligence will alter every aspect of our lives, from an international, to national to a personal level. Here is an excerpt of the book to give you an idea on it: Excerpts from ' Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power' by Rajiv Malhotra The AI-based concentration of power has taken on a terrifying new aspect. When we think of global power, countries like the US, China, and Russia readily come to mind. But today, private companies are accumulating immense power based on their ability to leverage AI and big data as tools to influence, manipulate and even control the minds of people. Some of these private companies may soon become more powerful than many nation-states, but the shift will not be obvious. They will not fly a flag or manage a currency (although some are attempting to launch their own cryptocurrency), and they will not wield military power, at least not directly. However, their unprecedented knowledge of people and things around the world, coupled with their ability to disrupt and alter the physical world and manipulate people’s choices, will lead to a new nexus of power. Such companies will decide who will, and who will not, be given access to this new form of power, and on what terms. Not one Indian company is a player in this league. Most unfortunate is that a large number of talented Indians work for American and Chinese companies in an individual capacity, including in top executive positions, but not as owners. Indians who do own companies tend to sell their stake when the right offer comes along. Whenever innovative entrepreneurs anywhere in the world develop a promising breakthrough, digital giants or venture firms that serve as their proxies are waiting to buy them out. As a result, hundreds of instant millionaires are being created at the individual level, including many living in India. I view this trend as the return of Britain’s East India Company, which started out in 1600 as a modest private company for the purpose of making profit from lucrative trade with India. Over its 250-year history, the East India Company became the world’s largest private business, amassing more wealth, income and military power than even its own British government. Despite being a private company, it became a colonial power—collecting taxes, operating courts, and running the military and other functions of state across many kingdoms within India. At the time, the East India Company had more ships, soldiers, money and territory under its control than any European government, though now it is remembered as a rogue machine. Since then, the lines between government and private companies have often blurred.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/books/features/excerpt-artificial-intelligence-and-the-future-of-power-by-rajiv-malhotra/articleshow/80994460.cms
2021-02-10,Bihar: MoU inked to check pollution through artificial intelligence,TNN,"PATNA: The state will now use artificial intelligence and remote sensing technology to spy the main sources of air pollution and take action against the violators. To begin with the new initiative, the Bihar State Pollution Control Board ( BSPCB ) on Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding ( MoU ) with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Under the MoU signed online by BSPCB chairman Dr Ashok Kumar Ghosh and India based representative of the UNDP Shoko Noda, the BSPCB would use the Geo AI platform developed by the UNDP Accelerator Lab and the University of Nottingham . Ghosh told this newspaper that the BSPCB would use the ‘digital solution’ technology for identifying the faulty brick kilns, places of stubble burning and urban areas with loads of pollutants emitted by vehicular traffic in all the 38 districts. However, the initiative will begin with the brick industry in the state. “Of the total 6,000 brick kilns, about 1,000 are yet to follow the new zigzag technology to check emission of pollutants. As most of them are situated in far remote areas, it was not possible to physically inspect all. Now, the artificial intelligence will pinpoint their location,” said Ghosh. Though stubble burning is not a common practice in Bihar, some cases were reported from Supaul and Nawada, he said. The major cause of air pollution in the state is the emission from vehicles, which in the event of traffic congestion and humid weather, increases much. Ghosh said the BSPCB has 11 monitoring stations and 24 under the process of installation. The artificial intelligence technology would, however, help identify the lanes and roads under heavy load of air pollution at different times, he said. “About 40% of deaths worldwide were due to air, water and soil pollution and the BSPCB, concerned over this fact, has now started using space intelligence to check it in the state,” Ghosh said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mou-inked-to-check-pollution-through-artificial-intelligence/articleshow/80773918.cms
2021-02-08,Going to the beach? Soon AI will help you surf to safety!,Preeti Biswas,"HYDERABAD: Headed for the beach but wondering if it’s the best time to surf or take a dip? What if you could have all the information about your preferred beach at the click of a button? Wouldn’t it be awesome if you could get real-time updates on how clean the beach is, what are the best spots or timings to hang out there or even the exact spot where those nasty rip currents could be lurking around hoping to drown you? Perhaps a couple of years from now, you may well be able to get all this information on your smartphone with the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) working on a new tech-enabled offering that will safeguard you and your loved ones on Indian beaches. INCOIS is developing this as part of its coastal monitoring and ocean state forecasting services. It will help tourists, surfers, beach-goers with real-time forecasts on rip currents, water pollution levels, perfect spots and timings to venture into the water for surfing . Currently, information related to sea state forecast is limited to waves, currents, winds and tides. Tourists even in hotspots like Goa, Mumbai and Visakhapatnam don’t have specific information on what the water quality is like at the beach or even the best time and spots to surf. “We will be deploying high resolution cameras to visualize wave direction and changes. Then, using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), we will be able to predict the rip currents that are dangerous for swimmers,” said Balakrishnan Nair TM, scientist and head, ocean information and forecast services group, INCOIS. The reams of data captured by the cameras and sensor-quipped buoys will be processed by the ANN to make predictions and provide real-time updates, he said, adding that the more the data is fed into the ANN, it will make it smarter and more accurate. This, he said, will be in addition to the other oceanographic equipment that will be deployed to understand the sea surface temperature, currents and pollution levels, among others. To begin with, the team is targeting beaches in tourist hotspots like Goa and Visakhapatnam where rip currents are very active. “Once we collect the data, we will run models and be able to provide surfing forecasts, water quality forecasts and rip current channels information. Tourists would exactly know if the water is suitable for surfing and which time is suitable for surfing. Not just that, we will be able to give out information on E-Coli, bacteria and harmful algae content in water,” said Balakrishnan. Officials said the idea is to eventually come up with ocean forecasting products that are useful for day-to-day tourists and specific users. “Modelling of observational data using emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Sciences will help us have higher resolution of forecast that will help us develop specialized products for specific users. Today, most ocean products are either meant for mariners, Navy officials, fishermen and coastal communities. The idea is to use technology to safeguard recreational activities on the coastline,” said INCOIS director T Srinivasa Kumar. The detailed forecast will not be disseminated only through mobile phones but also on huge digital boards installed on beaches. “In European countries, many beaches are `Blue Flag’ certified by the Foundation for Environmental Education. Once we develop the sea state forecast for rip currents and water quality, we will be able to work towards having more `Blue Flag’ beaches in India,” said Balakrishnan.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/going-to-the-beach-soon-ai-will-help-you-surf-to-safety/articleshow/80739902.cms

2021-02-05,IIIT-H researchers design AI video editing solution,TNN,"HYDERABAD: Researchers at the International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad (IIITH), who have been working on using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in video editing, have designed a complete end-to-end framework for video editing which can make video recording and editing cost-effective. Using AI, the system can automatically generate shots from various angles from single video input and can mimic an expert editor by selecting the shot that most vividly narrates the plot at each given instance. “It is a very dark time for theatre and other live performances. Small-sized companies are being forced to shut down because they can’t invest in heavy camera equipment and transition to live streaming. Our endeavour is to assist such houses and ensure the output is aesthetically top-notch,” said Vineet Gandhi from the CVIT lab, IIIT H, who has led the research. He said that the method adopted by his team is similar to the traditional creation of videos, where first shots are taken and then manually selected or edited to create a flowing storyline. What makes this system even more unique is that it creates cinematic-looking footage, he added. Gandhi said that according to the scientists, while incorporating gaze or eye-tracking data in the selection of shots is a desirable editing technique, relying completely on gaze is not always optimal. “To provide a smooth narrative, the algorithm has also been trained on cinematic principles such as avoiding cuts between overlapping shots, avoiding rapid shot transitions and maintaining a rhythm,” added Gandhi.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iiit-h-researchers-design-ai-video-editing-solution/articleshow/80695047.cms

Kumbh Mela police have identified a total of 50 locations, including main ghats of Har-ki-Pauri region, where the systems will be installed to monitor the number of pilgrims. Kumbh Mela police chief Sanjay Gunjyal said that through AI, it will be possible to detect whether social distancing norms are being properly followed by the pilgrims. “We have around two lakh sqm area on 107 river banks. This includes Har-ki-Pauri. In the wake of social distancing norms, we have assessed that around 1.8 lakh people can take bath at a time. To implement the rule, we are going to introduce AI for the first time in Kumbh history to count the number of pilgrims."" Fifty points have been selected covering most of the river banks and parking places, where this system can be installed along with CCTV cameras, Gunjyal said, adding that it will indicate, automatically, when it exceeds the number of pilgrims. Modern technology will be also used for crowd management and identifying any anti-social elements. Gunjyal said, “We have installed around 450 cameras across the Kumbh region in Haridwar and Rishikesh covering all the strategic points from Narsan border to Har-ki-Pauri. Hi-tech police surveillance control centre is being established. We can get live footage through the cameras and take quick decisions. A sharp mechanism to implement the commands by the ground teams is also in place.” Earlier, the government allocated around Rs 55 crore for the project with one year annual maintenance contract, but Kumbh Mela police hired an agency through a bid to complete this project in Rs 13.50 crore, with three years annual maintenance contract, he added.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-a-first-ai-to-be-used-for-social-distancing-at-haridwar-kumbh/articleshow/80674855.cms

Anti-fraud units have also been constituted to take forward suspected fraud filing of claims under the Ayushman Bharat–Mahatma Gandhi Rajasthan Swasthya BimaYojana 2021-2023 (AB-MGRSBY) re-launched by chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday. Now, it won’t be easy for hospitals to encash fraud claims under AB-MGRSBY. The health department claimed that alleged incidents of filing of fraud claims came into light in Bhamashah Swasthya Bima Yojna, which was launched by the previous BJP government in 2015. The state government has taken the complaints seriously which pointed out the involvement of corruption in the scheme. “Anti-fraud units will ensure any sorts of filing of fraud claims,” said Gehlot, during the re-launching of AB-MGRSBY. The state government is now taking help of technology for identifying suspected fraud insurance claims processed by hospitals under AB-MGRSBY. Through artificial intelligence, the health department will analyse all claims booked under the scheme. The artificial intelligence will point out patterns which are not common. These cases will be scrutinized further through medical and data audit before being declared as fraud cases. By making use of data available of filing of claims by hospitals, artificial intelligence will immediately pick the uncommon pattern and indicate the anti-fraud unit to conduct scrutiny of the claims. If any hospital, which does not have facilities for cardiac surgery, and the hospital filed a claims of cardiac surgery, the use of artificial intelligence will immediately pick the odd filing of the claims. The health department had found a hospital which was doing a particular surgery which was not happening in any other hospital in the numbers which it was doing. The hospital performed 96% cases of that particular surgery, which drew suspicion. Gehlot, after coming to power, had directed the officials to take measures for preventing such irregularities which were allegedly reported in newly launched Ayushman Bharat-Mahatma Gandhi Rajasthan Swasthya Bima Yojna (AB-MGRSBY).",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/anti-fraud-units-ai-to-prevent-graft-in-health-insurance-scheme/articleshow/80606036.cms
2021-01-24,"AI camera plan based on pseudo-science. I could look distressed if I need the loo, says rights lawyer Vidushi Marda",Sonam Joshi,"The Lucknow police recently announced that it would install AI-enabled cameras in the city to read the expressions of women in distress and alert nearby cops. Sonam Josh i spoke to Vidushi Marda , a lawyer at human rights group Article 19 who works on emerging technologies, about the dangers of using such emotion and facial recognition tech What is your reaction to Lucknow police’s plan? We are standing on a slippery slope. You say there are problems with safety and put in cameras, starting with CCTV a decade ago, then facial recognition and now emotional recognition. First, there is the question of where is the data going, where is it stored, who gets to see it and how do we ensure that policemen don’t misuse this data. Then the claim that if women are distressed, the camera will capture it, assume they need help and trigger an alarm. The first assumption is that AI can be used to gauge a person’s inner emotional state. This draws from the work of American psychologist Paul Ekman, who in the 1960s, came out with the theory that there is a universality of seven basic facial expressions which has been debunked since then. Even so, technology is being built on the basis of this pseudoscience. Very little is known about the link between facial movements and emotion, definitely not enough to warrant real-word applications that have consequences. I could look distressed if I need to use the bathroom or I haven’t slept. This is going to end up in a lot of false positives and negatives. It will end up surveilling women without any rational nexus to their safety or security . Is there a growing use of emotional recognition around the world? In the EU, there was a short-lived iBorderCtrl system to detect deception on traveller’s faces when they responded to border security agents’ questions. It is deployed in hiring, with companies like HireVue in the US automating job applications by claiming to understand what kind of a person a potential recruit is based on their facial expressions. We found the most evidence in education, especially in China, to ensure that children pay attention in class, don’t cheat and teachers are attentive. In the US, it is used to detect aggressive students in the context of school shootings. In driving, it is used to make sure your driver isn’t sleepy. On paper, these sound great but any emotional recognition technology is built on outdated science. Even if science progresses, even then using technologies like this in public space is inconsistent and untenable under our constitutional rights and international human rights. In India, we have a right to privacy even in public spaces. But facial recognition is already in use so isn’t emotion-reading AI the next step? In upcoming research, along with my co-author Shazeda Ahmed, we show how many Chinese companies, for instance, think of emotion recognition as the next logical step from facial recognition. Emotion recognition goes beyond facial recognition. It isn’t just about ‘I know who you are’ but ‘I’m going to assume what kind of person you are’. Because it is talking about an inner emotional state, it is something that you can’t prove or disprove. It becomes a question of power and he said versus she said where one entity is wielding power over another. Last year, Delhi Police used facial recognition to apprehend people during the riots and the anti-CAA protests. Are we likely to see more such instances? All signs point to that because the national level Automated Facial Recognition System and more localised forms of facial recognition have started rolling out in unfettered ways without deliberations or safeguards. More affluent countries such as the US, UK and Europe have found that facial recognition doesn’t work and is too dangerous, and some of these jurisdictions have stronger data protection . While the rest of the world is scaling back, we see it expanding at this alarming rate in India. Does the uproar over WhatsApp’s privacy policy indicate a growing awareness of data privacy in India? I’ve been using Signal for five years and I’ve never seen so many people on it, though it is still not the default. The fact that people recognise that there is something problematic about WhatsApp and the ways in which it is listening and recording people’s activities even though it is end-to-end encrypted means there is a tidal shift in how people think of privacy. For years, people brushed off privacy saying I am not important, I have nothing to hide. Now, I hear parents won’t send credit card details on WhatsApp because they think it is not safe. The fact that a unilateral policy change impacting the sharing and access of user data was made overnight without giving a meaningful choice has jolted the whole conversation on privacy to the forefront. It points to the problems of the power of platforms, the need to think about competition law, how we break up monopolies and public infrastructure being built by private players. Does the absence of a data protection law in India make tech platforms even more brazen? Since we don’t have data protection, it isn’t even a problem that the entities selling these technologies have to acknowledge. Having strong laws in place is like putting brakes on a car, ensuring that you are safer, have more control over your vehicle and can move faster. However, the last draft of the bill gives staggeringly wide exceptions to state entities, so we need to look at the final version.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/ai-camera-plan-based-on-pseudo-science-i-could-look-distressed-if-i-need-the-loo-says-rights-lawyer-vidushi-marda/articleshow/80425762.cms

2021-01-20,"Mission 2022: Delhi cops bet big on technology, artificial intelligence",TNN,"NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has signed two Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with National Forensic Science Laboratory and Indian Institute of Technology , Delhi for use of technology and artificial intelligence in policing and investigation . The MoUs were signed during Union home minister Amit Shah ’s visit to Delhi Police headquarters on Tuesday. Shah said when PM Narendra Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat, he had established a one-of-its kind university in forensic science aimed at incorporating scientific investigation into policing and using them in convictions in court. He asked for five targets to be set for each police station for their improvement and better performance by 2022, when the country will celebrate 75 years of Independence. He added that he would review the progress next year. “Last year was a challenge for all of us and police handled it well. Be it the northeast Delhi riots, lockdown, reopening of the lockdown, migrants’ movement and now the farmers’ agitation, Delhi Police passed all tests with flying colours. From the last man in the force to the top cop SN Shrivastava, I’m proud of everyone,” said Shah, while praising Delhi Police for its service during the pandemic. Paying homage to policemen who lost their lives in the line of duty, Shah said 7,667 cops got infected with Covid-19 and 30 were martyred. He added that apart from manning important installations, including embassies, headquarters of key organisations, PM residence, Rashtrapati Bhavan, police had also dealt with challenges like drug trafficking, terrorism, fake currency, among others. He also conferred ranks to policemen who had been given out-of-turn promotion for exceptional work. Promising to improve housing satisfaction and doubling it in the next five years, Shah said, “Six months ago, it was 19.5%. The approval for various residential projects has already been given. While Rs 230 crore have been allotted for 800 flats in Narela, Rs 466 crore have been given for 501 MIG flats. Delhi Police is itself constructing 700 houses for its personnel.” Shrivastava narrated how Delhi Police turned challenges into opportunities in 2020 while serving Delhiites during the lockdown and unlock period. The initiatives included feeding the needy, visiting the residences of the elderly, transporting sick people and pregnant women and ensuring smooth transportation of migrant labourers. He also gave a presentation on the technology leap taken by the force with initiatives like e-Beat Book, Integrated Complaint Monitoring System, Safe City Project and setting up of technological and social media cells. The home minister announced that 15,000 CCTV cameras would be installed in Delhi for close monitoring of crime and criminals and maintaining law and order. “A world-class data centre will be set up to link the CCTV cameras. All cameras at railway stations and those installed by Delhi government will also be linked to it to make Delhi a safe city,” added Shah.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mission-2022-cops-bet-big-on-tech-ai/articleshow/80353684.cms
2021-01-15,"AI-enabled ‘Drishti’ to keep eye on Lucknow, help curb crime",TNN,"LUCKNOW: It will not be easy for criminals to escape from the city after committing a crime , as 5,000 Artificial Intelligence-enabled cameras will keep a round-the-clock vigil in Lucknow Police commissionerate. All these cameras will be linked to the control room ‘Drishti’ that is being upgraded. Any unusual activity by anyone captured by the AI-enabled cameras will generate an alert to the control room. Lucknow police commissioner D K Thakur said after the completion of this project, the surveillance in the state capital will be advanced like in Hyderabad and Chennai. Joint commissioner of police, Headquarters/crime, Nilabja Chaudhury said AI-based cameras are extremely beneficial for police forces as they can identify criminals in a crowd. Another key aspect is that smart cameras can identify a person through faceless recognition by just using physical characteristics like height, built and posture. Besides, patterns of activities could be used in different environments to single out criminal behaviour. These cameras will also have the capability to read number plates and check registration data. All the shopkeepers in the city would also be asked to install AI-enabled CCTV cameras, which will be then linked to the control centre. JCP Chaudhury said that fibre optical network will be required to handle the feed of high-end AI-enabled CCTVs. The optical fibre is being laid and will be completed by the end of January, he added. Another police officer said that a sum of Rs 4 crore has been sanctioned for the installation of AI-enabled smart cameras. In the past also, Lucknow had planned similar surveillance in 2017 after which ‘Drishti’ control room was set up. The project had started and cameras were installed at 20 crossings but failed as most cameras became defunct soon.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ai-enabled-drishti-to-keepeye-on-city-help-curb-crime/articleshow/80276414.cms
2020-12-28,Andhra Pradesh forecasts energy demand using artificial intelligence,TNN,"VISAKHAPATNAM: For the first time in India, APTransco deployed the day-ahead electricity forecasting model using artificial intelligence and machine learning to forecast the next day’s electricity consumption (in units). This will also cover day-ahead electricity demand (in MW) for every 15 minutes. According to AP State Load Dispatch Centre (SLDC) officials, this will enable them to take decisions on electricity demand and supply, grid management and minimise power purchase cost. Google, with the support of the World Bank, has offered to jointly develop the forecasting model with the SLDC. The SLDC has carried out the development in-house. Various power-generating companies that have power purchase agreements (PPAs) with discoms will give their availabilities on a daily basis. With the development and deployment of this day-ahead electricity demand forecasting model, APTransco intends to develop more day-ahead forecast models for wind energy, solar energy, market prices, central generating stations surplus and frequency. It is also developing a low cost electricity dispatch model, which will have information on how much electricity should be dispatched every 15 minutes the next day from each generating station with the objective of minimising power purchase cost.

2020-12-26,"India 20th on Nature AI Index, 3rd in research",Chandrima Banerjee,"Elephants don’t play chess. They don’t need to. They need to know how to forage for food, protect themselves from predators, mate and migrate. In 1990, this argument changed how the world thought of Artificial Intelligence . MIT professor Rodney Brooks said AI must interact with the physical environment and not just rely on complex (and slow) computation of symbols, the way human brains do. So, they don’t all need to play chess. Three decades since then, AI seems to be in its summer (periods of slow funding have been called ‘AI winter’ by researchers). Between 2000 and 2019, global output for AI research grew by more than 600%, the latest ‘Nature Index 2020 Artificial Intelligence’, released last week, said. China, with a 120% jump in output, leads AI research this year. That has been complemented by technology we can use. The Nature Index placed the US at the top for AI innovation this year. India has been the third most productive country in AI research, with over 23,000 papers. On the overall AI Index, it is at the 20th position in alist dominated by European countries. Of the top 100 research organisations Nature identified, only one Indian organisation made the cut — Anna University in Chennai. In fact, an AI Readiness Index by UK-based consultancy Oxford Insights had in September given India a score of 100 on vision. Yet, the country was 40th on a list of 172 countries. “India, Russia and China all score near the bottom of the (Responsible Use) Sub-Index,” it said. So, it gave India a score of 31 on privacy and just 23 on transparency.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/india-20th-on-nature-ai-index-3rd-in-research/articleshow/79961137.cms
2020-12-24,Google told its scientists to 'strike a positive tone' in AI research: Report,Reuters,"OAKLAND: Alphabet Inc’s Google this year moved to tighten control over its scientists’ papers by launching a “sensitive topics” review, and in at least three cases requested authors refrain from casting its technology in a negative light, according to internal communications and interviews with researchers involved in the work. Google’s new review procedure asks that researchers consult with legal, policy and public relations teams before pursuing topics such as face and sentiment analysis and categorizations of race, gender or political affiliation, according to internal webpages explaining the policy. “Advances in technology and the growing complexity of our external environment are increasingly leading to situations where seemingly inoffensive projects raise ethical, reputational, regulatory or legal issues,” one of the pages for research staff stated. Reuters could not determine the date of the post, though three current employees said the policy began in June. Google declined to comment for this story. The “sensitive topics” process adds a round of scrutiny to Google’s standard review of papers for pitfalls such as disclosing of trade secrets, eight current and former employees said. For some projects, Google officials have intervened in later stages. A senior Google manager reviewing a study on content recommendation technology shortly before publication this summer told authors to “take great care to strike a positive tone,” according to internal correspondence read to Reuters. The manager added, “This doesn’t mean we should hide from the real challenges” posed by the software. Subsequent correspondence from a researcher to reviewers shows authors “updated to remove all references to Google products.” A draft seen by Reuters had mentioned Google-owned YouTube. Four staff researchers, including senior scientist Margaret Mitchell, said they believe Google is starting to interfere with crucial studies of potential technology harms. “If we are researching the appropriate thing given our expertise, and we are not permitted to publish that on grounds that are not in line with high-quality peer review, then we’re getting into a serious problem of censorship,” Mitchell said. Google states on its public-facing website that its scientists have “substantial” freedom. Tensions between Google and some of its staff broke into view this month after the abrupt exit of scientist Timnit Gebru, who led a 12-person team with Mitchell focused on ethics in artificial intelligence software (AI). Gebru says Google fired her after she questioned an order not to publish research claiming AI that mimics speech could disadvantage marginalized populations. Google said it accepted and expedited her resignation. It could not be determined whether Gebru’s paper underwent a “sensitive topics” review. Google senior vice president Jeff Dean said in a statement this month that Gebru’s paper dwelled on potential harms without discussing efforts underway to address them. Dean added that Google supports AI ethics scholarship and is “actively working on improving our paper review processes, because we know that too many checks and balances can become cumbersome.” ‘Sensitive topics’ The explosion in research and development of AI across the tech industry has prompted authorities in the United States and elsewhere to propose rules for its use. Some have cited scientific studies showing that facial analysis software and other AI can perpetuate biases or erode privacy. Google in recent years incorporated AI throughout its services, using the technology to interpret complex search queries, decide recommendations on YouTube and autocomplete sentences in Gmail. Its researchers published more than 200 papers in the last year about developing AI responsibly, among more than 1,000 projects in total, Dean said. Studying Google services for biases is among the “sensitive topics” under the company’s new policy, according to an internal webpage. Among dozens of other “sensitive topics” listed were the oil industry, China, Iran, Israel, COVID-19, home security, insurance, location data, religion, self-driving vehicles, telecoms and systems that recommend or personalize web content. The Google paper for which authors were told to strike a positive tone discusses recommendation AI, which services like YouTube employ to personalize users’ content feeds. A draft reviewed by Reuters included “concerns” that this technology can promote “disinformation, discriminatory or otherwise unfair results” and “insufficient diversity of content,” as well as lead to “political polarization.” The final publication instead says the systems can promote “accurate information, fairness, and diversity of content.” The published version, entitled “What are you optimizing for? Aligning Recommender Systems with Human Values,” omitted credit to Google researchers. Reuters could not determine why. A paper this month on AI for understanding a foreign language softened a reference to how the Google Translate product was making mistakes following a request from company reviewers, a source said. The published version says the authors used Google Translate, and a separate sentence says part of the research method was to “review and fix inaccurate translations.” For a paper published last week, a Google employee described the process as a “long-haul,” involving more than 100 email exchanges between researchers and reviewers, according to the internal correspondence. The researchers found that AI can cough up personal data and copyrighted material - including a page from a “Harry Potter” novel - that had been pulled from the internet to develop the system. A draft described how such disclosures could infringe copyrights or violate European privacy law, a person familiar with the matter said. Following company reviews, authors removed the legal risks, and Google published the paper.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/google-told-its-scientists-to-strike-a-positive-tone-in-ai-research-report/articleshow/79929428.cms

2020-12-18,Struggling in school? Take help from artificial intelligence to improve grades,Isha Jain,"Lucknow: Students struggling to keep up with competition can now use artificial intelligence to map their ‘learning DNA’ on a platform designed by education startup Focus Project. “I wanted to build an enterprise that had a mission and could make an impact,” says Sachin Mishra, the 36-year-old founder of the startup. The idea of doing something in the field of education made Mishra opt out of the placement exercise at his management school in Milan, Italy. Mishra has his roots in UP and was brought up in Gujarat. Prior to pursuing his MBA, he worked with an IT firm in Pune. In Spain, when Sachin was helping a friend in searching for a perfect school for his daughter, he came across learning gaps in schools and career choices being provided by schools to students in an unscientific manner. Soon after, Focus Project was founded in 2019 and it started operations the same year from Spain as Mishra found schools there more open to innovation and trying out new technologies. After a year, Mishra decided to come to his homeland to launch his startup. “We leverage AI to predict and recommend a student’s future using his past data,” said Mishra, who visited Lucknow last week to keep his startup rolling. Edtech, which is in the form of a web browser, creates a learning DNA of a student which keeps updating acquired and lacking skills across grades and eventually recommends an optimal career path/stream. “The startup is not limited to mathematics or science, but also works with one or more, core and non-core subjects. It is developed in a modular way to be suitable for any subject and any curriculum,” said chief growth officer at Focus Project Nishant Reddy, an IIM Indore alumnus. The platform identifies skill-level gaps by analysing the student’s performance data in regular formative and summative assessments. “We do comprehensive skill-mapping and then use data analytics to analyse the performance data. The end result is identification of skill-level learning gaps,” Sachin explained. The focus then is on finding the root causes. This is done through a four step approach which begins with diagnosis, then analysis, followed by practice with the loop ending in proficiency. Subsequently, subject-wise remedial teaching plans with a curated list of skills and sub-skills that students need to focus upon is given to teachers. Students too can access personalised practice worksheets to master a particular skill at their own pace.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/struggling-in-school-take-help-from-artificial-intelligence-to-improve-grades/articleshow/79787346.cms

2020-11-13,IIT-R scientists use AI to identify HIV drugs that can be repurposed for Covid-19 treatment,Tapan Susheel,"Roorkee: Scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (IIT-R) have used artificial intelligence to identify 10 drugs currently used to treat HIV that can be repurposed to treat Covid-19. The drugs are protease inhibitors, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat HIV. Some are already in use for the treatment of Covid-19, while others are undergoing trials. “Amprenavir would probably be most effective against Covid-19 based on our selected criterions,” said Soumitra Satapathi, lead author of the paper in the journal Plos One and associate professor of physics at IIT-R. The other drugs identified as potential Covid-19 treatments include Fosamprenavir, Indinavir, Saquinavir, Ritonavir, Paritaprevir, Lopinavir, Atazanavir and Tipranavir. The pandemic has witnessed a push for machine learning in drug development. Satapathi said that using AI-based models could save resources and time needed for synthesising novel drugs. “The complexity in drug design and protocols regarding clinical trials often inhibit the process of developing various new drug combinations for the disease. IIT Roorkee scientists have successfully deployed Machine Learning-based-AI techniques to predict the commercial drugs that could be used for the treatment of Covid-19,” said a statement from the institute. Other co-authors of the study were Sovesh Mohapatra, Prathul Nath, Manisha Chatterjee, Neeladrisingha Das, Deepjyoti Kalita and Partha Roy.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/iit-r-scientists-use-ai-to-identify-hiv-drugs-that-can-be-repurposed-for-covid-19-treatment/articleshow/79197641.cms
2020-11-11,Ex-IITians start AI revolution in Indian farming,Ikhhlaq Singh Aujla,"Picture used for representational purpose only CHANDIGARH: If technology started Green Revolution in the mid-1960s to multiply key crops’ production, livestock, and horticulture output, information technology (IT) and artificial intelligence (AI) drive the new millennium’s agriculture and its self-made entrepreneurs like ex-IITians Taranjeet Singh Bhamra and Rajamanohar Somasundaram. Their AI-powered platforms help the growers, buyers, and end-users of farm produce . Bhamra went to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), Kharagpur, while Somasundaram graduated from Kanpur. In 2016, Bhamra founded AgNext Technologies, an award-winning venture-capital backed company that envisions a new world of food value chain based on data science that can transform the way we grow, procure, trade, store, and consume food, benefiting all stakeholders in agribusiness . The Mohali-based enterprise built a platform for instant quality assessment and traceability linkages to remove subjectivity and bring transparency across food value chain. The company is bridging the agricultural sustainability and food safety gaps by digitalising food quality, safety, and traceability. Agriculture engineer Bhamra, who also holds a postgraduate diploma from the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Calcutta, said: “The major loss in the food supply chain occurs on production, storage and transportation of food from farms. AgNext’s AI-enabled solution ‘Qualix’ uses molecular science, computer vision and the internet of things (IoT) to sense food rapidly at every node of the supply chain to maintain its quality. It detects the conditions and the place in which the food is kept, and when it starts losing its quality. AgNext’s aim is to change the dynamics of food quality and safety in India by replacing manual procurement, trade, production, and consumption with technology.” Somasundaram, known as the ‘aquaman of India’, founded Aquaconnect, a venture that works with shrimp and fish farmers to improve their aquaculture productivity and market linkage through AI and satellite-based remote sensing technology. The Aquaconnect app is an AI-driven advisory solution and package of practices (POP) that helps farmers improve productivity, predict disease and achieve higher income. Somasundaram said: “Despite being a Rs 51,800 crore industry, aquaculture lacks technology adoption and efficiency. Production inefficiency due to the lack of scientific farming and tech tools raises the input cost, losses due to diseases. Farmers don’t get loans for inputs.” Started in April 2017, Aquaconnect’s Aquabazaar e-bidding platform helps 20,000-odd farmers of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat sell the produce directly to buyers. AquaCRED brings financial inclusion, transparency and predictability to credit access, lowering risk. Aquaconnect Super Store is where fish and shrimp farmers can buy quality feed, healthcare products, and equipment. Both Bhamra and Rajamanohar Somasundaram are upbeat about the use of AI in Indian agriculture. Bhamra said: “Till 20 years ago, nobody used data science in farming. A bit ahead of our times, we managed to create a niche segment and a scalable model that can be applied globally.” Somasundaram said: “We had some initial difficulties in making farmers adopt technology. Now we plan to enter Punjab and Haryana, where inland fisheries are coming up. We are on the cusp of transformation.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ex-iitians-start-ai-revolution-in-indian-farming/articleshow/79159568.cms

The system will provide real-time data on the quality of the water in the lake. Also, it will provide information regarding the biological functioning of the lake in real-time on a LED screen which has been installed near the lake. An individual can also track the lake's biological functioning through an app. While addressing a gathering during the launch of the project, funded by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and estimated to cost around Rs 1 crore, CM Rawat said, “Naini lake has become the first lake in the country to have this monitoring system. It is an attempt to monitor the changes happening in the lake. This will help in taking the necessary steps to protect and preserve the lake.” According to officials, sensors have been installed at two different locations in the lake and the LED screen has been put up in Tallital where people can check the status of the lake. The system will provide information about biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) – an important measure that determines the purity of the water – as well as dissolved oxygen (DO), concentration of chlorides, and the pH value, among other important indicators. The chief minister further announced that a sewage treatment plant (STP) will also be developed in the area to check the flow of wastewater into the lake. The Naini lake is not only a major tourist attraction in Nainital but also the sole source of drinking water for the hill town. Rawat also announced that the first survey of the Kotabagh-Nainital ropeway project has been completed and the work on ropeway projects in both Mussoorie and Yamunotri is underway.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/naini-lake-first-in-country-to-get-ai-based-lake-monitoring-system/articleshow/78876785.cms
2020-10-21,Uttarakhand to start 1st-ever snow leopard count with AI & gene analysis toolkit,Shivani Azad,"371 forest beats, mostly at altitudes above 3,000 metres, have already been identified (File photo) DEHRADUN : Uttarakhand is set to start its maiden exercise to count the population of the endangered snow leopard in the higher reaches of Himalayas with some help from genetic analysis techniques and photo-scanning artificial intelligence software. The numbers of the elusive cat will also be monitored in Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh and union territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh to arrive at an all-India count. The Uttarakhand forest department and the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) have identified 371 forest beats, mostly located at altitudes above 3,000 meters, where the survey would be conducted. A ‘snow leopard occupancy map’ will be created soon followed by installation of camera traps. JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand, said the occupancy map will classify areas as having low, medium or high population of snow leopards in ten forest divisions. These include Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri, Nanda Devi, Pithoragarh, Bageshwar, Govind, Rudraprayag, Uttarkashi and Tehri. CCTV cameras will be installed and photographs will be analysed using Artificial Intelligence (AI). For genetic analysis, scat will be collected and each sample will be given a unique identity number. S Sathyakumar, a senior scientist at WII who is spearheading the project in Uttarakhand, said AI and genetic analysis were being used in the country to count snow leopards for the first time to lower the risk of inaccuracy in the number count. Three years ago, India had done a “habitat quality” survey to estimate the snow leopard population, said Sathyakumar. The survey looked at the suitability of the habitat based on things like abundance of prey to arrive at estimated numbers. “According to the habitat quality-based estimation, there are about 620 snow leopards in India and Uttarakhand is home to 86 of them,"" he said. It is estimated that 7,000-odd snow leopards exist in 12 countries, including India, where the animal is found.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/armed-with-ai-genetic-analysis-toolkit-ukhand-to-start-first-ever-snow-leopard-count/articleshow/78774204.cms

2020-10-12,Educational institutes gamble on AI proctors to ensure ‘cheat-free’ online exams,Parth Shastri,"Ahmedabad: As the first semester of the academic year has already gone or set to go online for premier academic institutes in and around Ahmedabad, the major issue the institutions are facing is of evaluation. Several of the institutes have already procured the digital artificial-intelligence (AI)-enabled proctors – roughly translated to invigilator or supervisor – to ensure that the exams conducted online are cheating free and have credence. Majority of the institutes mentioned that they are not going to reduce the syllabus even as the school syllabus is recently slashed at both central and state levels given the nature of virtual learning. Prof S Shanthakumar, director of Gujarat National Law University (GNLU), said that the institute has procured AI-based proctored online examination software for online assessment. “We are not considering any reduction in the syllabus. Doing so will dilute the programme quality and the same will not be in the long-term interest of students,” he said. DAIICT is also one of the institutions to put in place the AI-based proctor system to carry out online tests and examinations. “There will also be one mid-term and an end-semester examination for majority of the courses,” said Soman Nair, executive registrar of the institute. Prof Shailesh Gandhi, dean (programs) at IIM Ahmedabad (IIM-A), said that the B-school has upgraded technology for online examination and proctoring. Dedicated servers for online exams are also set up. “We will complete the entire coursework by reducing term-breaks and extending the term dates,” he said. Prof Chirayu Bhatt, deputy provost (academics) at CEPT University, said that there is no reduction in the syllabus, but academic calendar is modified for the undergraduate students to ensure minimal impact on learning outcomes. “We have reduced the total credits required for the fieldwork this year. Our rural immersion and MI-Impact programme are online this year,” said Prof Ashutosh Dutt, chair of PGP programme at MICA. “The entire evaluation is online with electronic invigilation.” Prof Kabeer Jasuja, dean (academic affairs) at IIT Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn), said that while no changes are made in curriculum, pedagogy is changed as the lectures are recorded and sent to the students – the virtual discussion on topics follow. “The teaching and learning mechanism was started on time for the ongoing semesters,” said Prof T P Singh, director (academics). “At present, practical sessions are conducted virtually. When the campus opens, the students will be exposed to critical components even from the previous semesters.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/educational-institutes-gamble-on-ai-proctors-to-ensure-cheat-free-online-exams/articleshow/78623312.cms
2020-09-25,IIT-Hyderabad researchers use AI to detect mobile use by drivers,TNN,"File photo of IIT Hyderabad HYDERABAD: Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad are using artificial intelligence (AI) based algorithms to detect mobile phone usage among drivers. Distraction caused due to usage of mobile phones during driving is one of the major factors behind the increasing number of road accidents. Researchers have used algorithms based on deep-learning to detect mobile-phone usage on a dataset. The algorithm runs at nearly 27 frames-per second on a high end graphics processing unit (GPU), which means it can process a video in real-time. Dr Sparsh Mittal , the lead researcher, said, “We believe that our technique has immense potential. It can help in avoiding accidents due to distraction during driving. It can help improve productivity by preventing excess or untimely usage of the mobile phone.” The algorithm can also help track mobiles being used at restricted places or lost phones. Explaining, Mittal said mobile phones are prohibited in many places such as petrol pumps, exam halls, embassies, military bases, and courts of law, and their tool can be used to find whether the mobile phone is being used in such areas. “Many financial transactions now happen on mobile phones, and hence, the loss of mobile phones can have severe consequences. By allowing tracking of mobile phone, our technique can help in detecting loss or theft of the mobile phone,” said Mittal. Elaborating on this research, Poonam Rajput, research scholar at IITH, said, “ We have used algorithms based on deep-learning to detect mobile-phone usage. Our fastest algorithm runs at nearly 27 frames-per-second on a high-end GPU, which means it can process a video in real-time. Our algorithms achieve nearly 99% accuracy on the Kaggle Driver dataset and 96% accuracy on the IITH-DMU dataset. Our work is the first to detect mobile phones’ usage in both indoor and outdoor environments with a lot of clutter.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iit-hyd-researchers-use-ai-to-detect-mobile-use-by-drivers/articleshow/78305004.cms

2020-08-14,Hyderabad: Start-up develops AI and ML-based smart ventilator,Amrita Didyala,"Smart ventilator which uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to allow doctors to remotely manage a patient’s health. A city-based start-up, under the state government’s initiative — Hyderabad Security Cluster — has developed a smart ventilator which uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to allow doctors to remotely manage a patient’s health. The ventilator, developed by Leven Medical, can also track a patient’s contacts, alert authorities and predict possible clusters that may develop, with its Covid tracking software. “The data curated during the current pandemic is a mine for future research and policy making. Our smart solution will predict patterns, provide inputs to government agencies and prevent data breaches. The innovation is a scalable model, shaped by inputs from the likes of UC Berkeley, Johns Hopkins and researchers around the globe,” said founder and CEO of Leven Medical, Zaki Qureshey. “The ventilator is a highly disruptive innovation in terms of technology and pricing. We are in talks with a few investors currently and are likely to start production by the next month. We are looking at producing 1,500 to 2,000 units per month,” Qureshey added. Speaking about the development, IT and industries principal secretary Jayesh Ranjan said, “When Covid-19 cases started surging, it was reported that therewould be a major shortage of ventilators. Some hospitals and the government tried to import ventilators at the time but they were very costly and short in supply. This was a major cause of concern. But the innovation ecosystem rising up to the occasion has come as a relief.” “This is one great example of converting adversity into opportunity and shows the agility on how quickly our home-grown start-ups can develop the necessary technologies without compromising on any features and keeping in mind the cost-effectiveness,” the principal secretary said. “The capabilities that this innovation has in terms of tracking and providing data is the need of the hour. Take an example of a remote area where it is difficult to get doctors. This will allow a normal person to connect the ventilator to a patient and an expert sitting somewhere far can monitor vitals and provide necessary inputs. It can go a long way in saving lives,” said Verizon Asia-Pacific head of solutions and HSC founder, Prashanth Gupta.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/start-up-develops-ai-and-ml-based-smart-ventilator/articleshow/77533398.cms
2020-08-09,Mumbai: BMC to start AI-based voice tests within a week to detect Covid-19,TNN,"MUMBAI: The BMC will next week onwards start using a voice sampling method to diagnose Covid-19 at one of its jumbo facilities. “We will use an AI-based voice sampling application in a pilot project covering 1,000 patients, both suspected and confirmed, at our Nesco facility in Goregaon,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani on Saturday. Voice analysis was used in some European nations, including France and Italy, to detect Covid-19. In fact, a group of students from a Navi Mumbai engineering college recently ‘retuned’ their 2008 voice analytical program to detect Covid-19 among suspected patients. “We will compare the voice analysis findings with RT-PCR results,” said Kakani. If the pilot shows promise, the BMC plans to use the program in its other hospitals as well. “It is non-invasive and can deliver results quickly,” he added. RT-PCR stands for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. While RT-PCR results take an average of 24 hours (from collection of samples to results), BMC’s new tests such as the antigen test gives results within 30 minutes. The rapid antibody blood tests available in the private sector too quickly reveals if the patient has been exposed to the novel coronavirus. However, there has been a lot of debate over the efficiency of these tests. A doctor, who is associated with the BMC, said that the voice analysis method isn’t very sensitive. “It could lead to a lot of positives,” he said. While BMC officials said the whole voice analysis project was its own initiative, it is learnt that an IIT team is helping out. The test involves a person speaking into a smart phone or computer with the app. The app, which has been finetuned with voice data of thousands of patients with Covid-19 or other respiratory ailments, will run the patient’s voice reading against its database and detect the condition. From placing disinfection panels at its offices to using kiosks that allow contactless testing of patients, the BMC has been proactively using innovations in its battle against the novel coronavirus infection. “But rules are stringently followed. Even the voice analysis project is awaiting an ethics committee approval that should come within a couple of days,” said a senior official.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-to-start-ai-based-voice-tests-within-a-week-to-detect-covid-19/articleshow/77440336.cms

There are different areas our researchers are contributing to: diagnostics (including rapid, cheaper and mobile testing solutions), vaccine development, hospital assistive devices like ventilators and oxygen concentrators, santisation solutions, models predicting pandemic spread and more. We’ve also set up a test centre to facilitate increased testing. ■ How do you think the new education policy will impact doing science in India? The new education policy is a detailed and comprehensive document. We will need some time to study its recommendations to understand what changes it will bring about in higher education and research in the country. ■ Interdisciplinary science has become more relevant than ever now, is India doing enough? There are no boundaries in nature between physics, mathematics, biology, and chemistry. So, in order to better understand how the world works and to solve our pressing problems, we must move towards an interdisciplinary curriculum, something I believe the new education policy also emphasises. We’ve also adopted this philosophy in our research. We’ve set up many departments that are inherently interdisciplinary — new centres that work on water, energy, nanotechnology, bioengineering, data science, autonomous systems and so on. In fact, this is why we set up the Division of Interdisciplinary Research in 2014, which I chaired until I took over as the director. And when I look around, I see many more universities and colleges pushing for interdisciplinary education and research, which is encouraging. ■ Which are, in your opinion, some of the focus areas Indian science must look at in the next decade? We must continue to do cutting-edge basic research we are known for. In particular, Indian science should focus on emerging areas such as quantum technologies, artificial intelligence, materials genomics, and cyber physical systems. But it’s also important to focus on the pressing problems that we face, ranging from infectious diseases to climate change. As I’ve mentioned before, these are not problems that can be addressed solely by researchers specialising in just one field — as we’re seeing with the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, it is important, especially in a country like India, to strike a balance between what are traditionally called fundamental and applied research.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/emerging-areas-like-ai-quantum-tech-must-be-indias-focus/articleshow/77402776.cms
2020-08-04,US-based Bengali prof uses AI to restore earliest surviving film of India,Priyanka Dasgupta,"Kolkata: An assistant research professor at the University of Maryland , has used Artificial Intelligence (AI) to restore what is largely recognized as the earliest surviving film to be shot in India. In May this year, Aniket Bera had used AI to colour clips of “Pather Panchali”. Although the silent film’s title states that this is Calcutta, the footage was shot in Banaras. The good news is that this step has promise to bring about a change in automatic video restoration of old films that are on the verge of being lost forever. Aniket Bera According to the British Film Institute website, this film dated 1899 appears under ‘Panorama of Calcutta, India, From the River Ganges’ title in the Warwick Trading Company’s catalogues. “The same catalogue shows other films - now lost - from around Calcutta, which were presumably shot by the same cameraman on the same trip, and may explain the confusion”, the website states. British film historian Denis Gifford has credited this film to John (‘Mad Jack’) Benett-Stanford, who had recorded the only film of the Battle of Omdurman in 1898. India's Oldest Video from 19th Century Restored (8K, 50 fps and Color) using Artificial Intelligence Bera’s technique used for this restoration of this two-minute-long film is similar to what he had used in “Pather Panchali”. “But this was extremely hard since the video quality was very old and the frames per second were extremely low. The quality has been improved manifold with the resolution of 8K and 50 fps (10 times higher than original),” said Bera, who was born and brought up in Delhi with roots in Vidyanagar village of South 24 Parganas district. For this automatic video restoration, Bera first used “upscaling”. This automatically improved the resolution and removed the noise based from the video. “The original FPS (frames per second) is just 10 and makes the video look very choppy and abrupt. The AI interpolates learns, analyzes and predicts how the frames would have existed in reality when they were filmed. The AI upgraded 50 FPS makes the video look super smooth. As for the colourisation process, AI imagines these colors based on what it thinks the original color would look like after the AI has been trained on 1000s of old videos,” Bera added. The colorization, he admitted, has room for improvement. For this video, it took approximately six-seven hours for the upscaling and four-five hours for the FPS improvement. “Approximately, it takes only 10 hours. Colourization will take three-four hours. Restoration is a very labour-intensive work and can take months, years and cost many man-hours. Using an AI system like mine, anyone can do this sitting at home and spending a few hours with virtually no cost. Videos of all old movies, films and documentaries can be restored this way!” he said. Film scholars and directors see hope in this use of AI. Film scholar Sanjoy Mukhopadhyay said, “Colourisation can be problematic but this is a fundamental contribution to film and social history and will go a long way towards restoring jewels on the verge of extinction.” According to director Atanu Ghosh , “Though old videos have various kinds of issues, this AI experiment can open new doors if it is proved to be a cheaper, viable and technically convenient alternative.” On being asked if AI can help restore the audio, Bera said, “There is some recent work in AI that can automatically clean audio and even restore it. I personally don’t know much about this area but this is a hot research topic as well.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/us-based-bengali-prof-uses-ai-to-restore-earliest-surviving-film-of-india/articleshow/77322212.cms

If you happen to have a photo of the winged beauty, head straight to https://butterflyvision.in and upload the picture to get details like general and scientific names of the butterfly and its habitat. The site is the brainchild of Vadavalli-based Theivaprakasham Hari, who is pursuing an MTech in Data Science at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham . “I wanted to develop an application for easy identification of butterflies in 2012 after finishing Class XII. I used to participate in butterfly walks. Those days, we did not even have a database of butterflies and were referring Kerala’s database, expensive books and depending on experts. I wanted to make the identification process easy for the common man,” Theivaprakasham, who is also the secretary of the Nature and Butterfly Society (TNBS), told TOI. It took him seven years to collect photographs of various species of butterflies and make the website powered by artificial intelligence (AI). “I took as many as 1.5 lakh photographs of butterflies based on parameters such as life stages and seasonal forms from various angles. I also sourced close to 25,000 photographs from butterfly enthusiasts. The photographs were used to train the AI. I launched the site last November” The AI can identify 340 butterfly species found in the southern parts of the country with 95% accuracy. Theivaprakasham is now developing an app that can identify butterflies even in offline mode. “The application will be launched for Android and iOS within a couple of months. It will provide details like description, host plant and habitats.” The website was used for several surveys, including the one conducted in collaboration with the forest department in the Sathyamangalam forest range. “After the website was launched, people contributed over 500 photos of butterflies. I need more photos to increase accuracy,” Theivaprakasham added.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/city-lads-ai-platform-identifies-butterflies-from-just-a-photo/articleshow/77308300.cms

2020-07-24,AI by Delhi student to aid in Covid fight,Shradha Chettri,"NEW DELHI: A 17-year-old Class XII student is set to become the youngest contributor to the fight against Covid-19. His web-based application called LungAI, submitted for the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Ideathon competition, has been awarded by the Union ministry of human resource development . Aryan Gulati is the youngest of the five award winners, his application being prominent in the sustainable environment category. A science student of Delhi Public School , RK Puram, Gulati is currently in a dialogue with the Indian Council of Medical Research to validate his application with further testing. His application is a combination of six machine-learning models that not only detect Covid in 3-5 seconds, but also 16 other pulmonary diseases, including lung cancer. “It has an accuracy of over 90%,” Gulati explained to TOI. “Apart from the swab test, what I thought could detect the novel coronavirus were the changes in the lung-like fluid buildup, consolidation and changes that occur when someone is infected with Covid over time.” Gulati’s system takes these changes as factors. The machine learning detects how many of the features match Covid images, and after the matching gives a figure of probability on the presence of the coronavirus. The Class XII student added the features for other lung diseases so that the system could also be used for non-Covid reasons in the future. The website also guides the user in the other logical step to take. “It has the option of sending the detection possibility along with the images to various doctors and hospitals online by using an automatic messaging system developed for the website in case the user wishes to get a second opinion or the option of contacting hospitals in the user’s vicinity,” elaborated Gulati, who hopes to study computer science in any of the Indian Institutes of Technology after this schooling. With his application, the testing need not be confined to the laboratory but can also be carried out at hospitals. “This is because it does not need specialised labs or equipment. We just need a person using a computer and X-ray images to be uploaded,” said Gulati, whose father is in the army. Gulati had been working on this project since March. To arrive at this model, he used verified data freely available on the internet. However, for the Covid data, he approached universities like John Hopkins in the United States and various radiology societies.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ai-by-city-student-to-aid-in-covid-fight/articleshow/77136586.cms

2020-07-11,Private universities use AI to kick-start admissions in a changed world,Shradha Chettri&Mohammad Ibrar,"NEW DELHI: While the central and state universities are waiting for the University Grants Commission guidelines for vital decisions during the Covid-19 pandemic , most private universities have already worked out the academic calendar and the admission procedure . The admission process has fully shifted online, mostly through AI-proctored entrance tests and live interviews. While classes are likely to start from August, the universities will decide on online or offline mode on the basis of the Covid-19 situation. Shiv Nadar University announced in May itself its decision to conduct online admission tests “using an AI mechanism that is secure and ensures anti-cheating surveillance”. The university has also accepted existing SAT scores. In the absence of Class XII board marks, provisional admissions are being granted on the basis of school grades and entrance tests. Rupamanjari Ghosh, vice-chancellor of Shiv Nadar, said, “We are committed to ensuring that students continue their education without interruption during these difficult times.” OP Jindal Global University is also taking the online route. The university’s law entrance test, a written examination since its inception in 2009, will be conducted entirely online on July 19. “It will become India’s first and only law entrance exam to be entirely online, AI-enabled remote-proctored,” said an official. The system ensures recording of the candidates’ examinations for review to protect the integrity of the examination process, he added. The university has also conducted its admissions for all degree programmes through the online Jindal Scholastic Aptitude Test. The admission process is also on at Amity University, which has live online interview sessions for some programmes. “For this year, we have made the admission process fully online. After filling up application forms, students have to upload three videos of randomised questions asked to them,” said Atul Chauhan, its chancellor. After a panel of interviewers evaluates the form and the videos, a selected student will get the admission letter on the admission microsite, he added. At Amity, classes for senior students are starting on July 13 in remote teaching mode. For freshers, classes may begin before September. Ashoka University has already decided August 24 as the orientation day and will begin classes on August 31. “Classes will be online till the mid-semester break, which begins on October 10. The decision on holding online or physical classes will be taken closer to that time,” said the university spokesperson. Bennett University has provided a flexible online admission procedure. While the university will continue its engineering admission process till the JEE exams are conducted, it is admitting students who appeared for the JEE mains exams in January. “If they have Class XII scores, they can secure admissions with their PCM (physics, chemistry and mathematics) scores. Even if there are students with no board exam results and they come to us with pre-board exam scores, we will provide them provisional admissions with our 60% eligibility criteria,” said Nandkumar Dhake, vice-president for sales and marketing, Bennett University. The university will cross-check their Class XII scores once the board results are out and complete the admissions.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//education/news/private-univs-use-ai-to-kick-start-admissions-in-a-changed-world/articleshow/76901919.cms

2020-07-04,This AI device can alert you on person around with Covid,U Sudhakar Reddy,"Hyderabad: Three students and faculty of Hyderabad-origin currently with universities in the United States and Delhi have created a device based on Artificial Intelligence technology that can give an alert when a person with Covid-19 symptoms such as high body temperature approaches. Researchers said that the advantage of the novel device is that it helps not only in maintaining social distancing but also give an alert when a person having Covid symptoms like fever comes close in the range. Rahul Reddy Nadikattu of IT department, University of Cumberlands, Sikender Mohsienuddin Mohammad, Department of Information Technology, Wilmington University and Dr Pawan Whig Dean Research, Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies, Delhi, took part in the research. The research study, titled Novel Economical Social Distancing Smart Device for Covid-19 has been published in the June edition of International Journal of Electrical Engineering and Technology. Rahul Reddy told TOI, “Using artificial intelligence, the novel smart device for maintaining social distancing as well as detecting Covid-19 symptoms has been devised. The device will give alert to the person if someone is in the critical range of six feet around him. The wearable device consists of a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor, micro-controller, and mobile for display and gives alert to the user. The sensor will detect the distance between the wearer and others around them. The micro-controller measures desired length, triggers the alarm and sends a mobile alert to the user.” The PIR sensor receives infrared radiation from the human body to produce an alert to the mobile. “The temperature of the normal human body is 36 degree celsius to 27 degree celsius and most of its radiant energy is concentrated in the wavelength range of 8-12 µm. If the human infrared radiation is directly irradiated on the radar, it will cause a temperature change to output a signal. Still, in doing so, the detection distance will not be far. Thermal conductivity temperature of the body can be calculated. Using a machine learning algorithm, it detects whether the person has Covid-19 symptoms.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/this-ai-device-can-alert-you-on-person-around-with-covid/articleshow/76778615.cms

(File photo) MUMBAI: Students sitting at home can appear for entrance exams for mass media (BMM), management (BMS) and four masters’ programmes offered at St Xavier’s College (Mumbai). For the first time, it will conduct an artificial intelligence-proctored test, that will allow aspirants to give it from anywhere in India. Principal Rajendra Shinde said the test was outsourced to an agency. “It has software that tracks a candidate’s eye movement and any other movement in the room. It gives three warnings and then logs the student out the fourth time,” said the principal. “We had to opt for the software, as conducting physical exams seemed impossible with Covid-19,” he said. While few have an online system for admissions in place, most city colleges are scurrying to set it up. Some offered forms online, but students had to physically submit documents and make payments. Covid-19 has compelled colleges to look for end-to-end online solutions for admissions. Some have outsourced the process to complete junior (class XII) and degree (second and third year) college admissions. D G Ruparel College principal Tushar Desai said they were finalising a software for admissions. ""We released class XI results online but we cannot call students to the campus for admissions to maintain social distancing. Colleges will have to ensure the software is mobile-friendly, so that students are not forced to go to a cyber cafe. The idea is to enable students to complete admissions from home,” said Desai. The college is also used by BMC as a quarantine centre and therefore the process is slightly delayed. At Kelkar-Vaze College (Mulund), admissions had gone online last year. While students filled regular admission forms for degree colleges online, Google forms were circulated for students to fill choices of subjects now, said principal B B Sharma. Matunga’s Ruia College too had a system, but document verification for first year admissions was offline. A western suburbs college professor said many students were comfortable with online payment mode. “Since these are internal college admissions, the process was convenient. For first year junior and degree college admissions, colleges will have to get more features,” said the professor. Second and third year online classes are likely to start from July. TIMES VIEW: While some administrative processes had gone online, the state never invested much in campus digitization. Covid-19 poses a big challenge to colleges and universities, which have had students queuing up to get work done, be it admissions, revaluation or any documentation. As colleges look at reopening academic sessions online, getting systems in place is now a priority.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/xaviers-selects-ai-others-hunt-for-online-admission-solutions/articleshow/76633361.cms

The AICTE has approved the courses after inspecting the facilities and infrastructure of the university. The absence of modern-day courses has been forcing meritorious students to head to other states to pursue these courses. “These are among the most important and preferred course in the country. I am hoping that these courses would attract deserving and meritorious students from across the state. It is going to lay a foundation of modern courses in the state and help in reviving engineering education,” said R A Gupta, vice-chancellor of RTU. The new courses will be available for the upcoming session. The subject expertise in artificial intelligence will allow students explore different avenues related to human intelligence using computers. While the course in cyber security is among the most employable. Mukesh Choudhary, an official cyber-crime consultant to Jaipur Police Commissionerate, said cybersecurity has become a need for everyone: from a corporation to the government and from an institute to all law enforcement agencies. “Cybersecurity experts have huge opportunities even during the time of Covid-19. It is among the highest paid jobs in the engineering stream,” Choudhary said. All the four courses would have 60 seats each and it will be available in the maiden year at the RTU and in some affiliated colleges. The courses have been finally inducted into the university after it was approved by the academic council on Saturday. BOX RTU sets up computer labs in adopted villages Leading by an example, RTU is establishing a computer lab at its two adopted villages for the school and college students so that they can attend online classes due to Covid-19 comfortably. The lab will include one studio, which will have a big screen for accommodating 20 students at a time. The teachers of RTU are also preparing content in science and maths for these students.

2020-06-14,Automation the way ahead for manufacturers in Gujarat,Nimesh Khakhariya,"Rajkot/ Ahmedabad: The famed entrepreneurial spirit of Gujarat is known for innovatively handling the hour of crisis, and that triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic was no different. Manufacturing units, whether in engineering or other essential services sectors, were reeling from extreme manpower shortage due to the mass exodus of migrant labourers. However, in desperate times, Gujarati manufacturers took to different measures and many opted for automation to sustain production capabilities. Rajkot’s famed engineering industry is looking to turn the the adverse situation into an opportunity. With 70% of skilled migrant workers leaving for their native places, a large number of units engaged in automobile part and other key engineering goods are reviving their plans to go for automation and artificial intelligence-based technology in manufacturing. Parth Ganatra, who makes agriculture machinery in Metoda GIDC, said, “I will be investing Rs 2.5 crore to buy machines for automation of submersible assembly and welding, which will cost nearly Rs 1.50 crore. The bearing races for CNC machine will cost me nearly Rs 1 lakh. I am in advanced talks with a Japanese firm to purchase AI-based automation machinery.” Ganatra, who is also the president of Rajkot Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI), said his unit will be able to reduce dependency on 28 people using automation and robotics. “In the long run, this will also bring down production cost, reduce production losses, increase efficiency and give better quality products,” he added. Similarly, Brijesh Dudhagara, a foundry-owner in Aji GIDC, said, “I switched to automation a few years ago and I got good orders too. I am planning to speed up purchasing AI-based technology for my unit.” Industry sources said that they don’t expect the workforce to return soon and one-time capital investment in automation will reduce their dependency on migrants. According to an estimate, at least one lakh workers – majority of them migrants – are employed in the units in Rajkot and industrial clusters around the city. This was the first time in the industry’s history that a majority of their skilled hands had left the city. Industries are planning to use automation in the assembly line of submersible pumps, ball bearing races, bearing grinding and automobile spare parts where welding work can be done by robots and that too for 24 hours. CNC machines can be operated by robots. According to industry players, the engineering sector in Rajkot is currently working at 50 percent capacity because of labor shortage. There are fewer orders, but plant oweners are worried about coping when the flow of orders returns to normalcy. Similar is the situation in other parts of Gujarat as well. For instance, Adani Wilmar deployed automation in loading-unloading and packaging processes at its edible oil manufacturing units here. “We have specially procured robotic arms that help in packing bottles or pouches in the carton and seal it. Similarly, other initiatives have been taken in loading-unloading process and even handling of items on the conveyor belt. With several automation initiatives, our manpower requirement has come down drastically. In fact, since edible oil fell under essential commodities, the manufacturing activity at our factory had been ongoing through most part of the lockdown. Automation helped us maintain production levels in the range of 60-70% which would not have been possible otherwise,” said Angshu Mallick, deputy director, Adani Wilmar Limited. Manufacturers of food products are also looking at automation from the hygiene point of view. “Last year, we invested in a new line so that manpower requirement becomes low. It’s a fully automatic line for production and packaging of frozen potato-based food products, which involves minimum human intervention. While automation not just helps in reducing manpower requirement, it also helps us maintain better hygiene and cleanliness in our manufacturing process, especially in the time of Covid-19 pandemic,” said Haresh Karamchandani, chief executive officer, HyFun Food, which manufactures frozen potato-based food products. --With inputs from Niyati Parikh (Ahmedabad) Photo quotes: “Even before Covid-19, many companies were planning to go for automation for mass production. These plans are now being expedited.” Paresh Vasani, president, Rajkot Engineering Association (REA) “There has been a surge in inquiries and orders from across the industrial sectors including engineering and brass for AI and machine learning tools. We believe this demand will only increase now.” Jaydeep Nandani, president, Rajkot Information Technology Association (RITA) Box: Embracing automation in Rajkot Rajkot holds a 70% share in automobile parts supply in India 10,000 units are into automobile and agri equipments in Rajkot Around 70,000 of one lakh workers have left for home states Those who stayed back are unskilled workers Roughly, Rs1 cr investment in automation can reduce demand of 10 labourers Demand for robots, AI-based tools surging",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/automation-the-way-ahead-for-manufacturers-in-gujarat/articleshow/76364732.cms
2020-06-14,"Lucknow: CCTV cameras, AI-based lights to control traffic, issue e-challan",Rahul Tripathi,"LUCKNOW: The work to install the integrated traffic management system (ITMS) in the city has resumed following relaxation in the lockdown. The project, already delayed by a year, is expected to be completed by June 30. Artificial intelligence-based lights will regulate traffic flow at 155 crossings. The project includes a network of CCTV cameras at 20 major crossings and speed violation detection at 10. The cameras will capture images of traffic violators and transmit it to the command centre for issuing e-challan. Violations which cameras can capture include jumping red light, riding without helmet and tripling, among others. The major tasks still pending include connecting the system with the command centre at Lalbagh and integrating ITMS with centralised databases of all-India vehicle registration numbers required to identify vehicles of other districts and states. “Traffic lights have been installed at 89 crossings and red light violation detection systems at five. We have written to authorities to expedite the process as the project is already delayed,” said DCP traffic Charu Nigam. Municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi, nodal officer of the project, said, “The deadline given to the vendor to complete work is June 30.” Conceptualised in 2016, the Rs 110-crore project was expected to start in 2018, but got delayed owing to several bottlenecks. A part of it was launched on August 15, 2019 and the project was supposed to be fully launched by March 20 this year, but was delayed again due to the pandemic.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cctv-cameras-ai-based-lights-to-control-traffic-issue-e-challan/articleshow/76364943.cms
2020-05-26,How we can use AI in fight against Covid-19,TNN,"The Covid-19 pandemic has devastated lives and livelihoods across the world, but technology in general and artificial intelligence (AI) in particular is helping to significantly mitigate its effects, experts said on Monday at the global online conference, ‘ AI Solutions for Covid ’, organised by the Department of Computer Science Engineering of Bennett University . India must develop cutting-edge tech Telecom and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the coronavirus-hit world needs to adopt technology and AI even more strongly and the efforts are required in areas such as agriculture, healthcare and education. Top Picks For You Need to adopt AI aggressively to ensure inclusive development in corona-hit world: Ravi Shankar Prasad ‘AI will play a critical role in post-Covid recovery’ AI will be key for contactless solutions across industries: Startups AI can be used to determine human emotions during Covid-19 Prasad said the government is already focused on harnessing technology to ensure inclusive growth and distribution of relief and social-sector benefits in an equitable manner. His ministry is also trying to see, for instance, how crop yields can be improved by predicting the weather. The government, he said, wants much of the cutting-edge technology to be developed within the country, for which it is also encouraging the startup ecosystem. Sandip Patel , GM for IBM’s India and South Asia business, said the world has witnessed a sudden adoption of digital across governments, businesses and individuals. IBM, he said, is deploying AI and technology for local language support on Covid queries in Andhra Pradesh. “We have been working to implement a Watson assistant which is hosted on the ICMR portal to respond to specific queries,” he said. Google Research India director Manish Gupta said technology and AI were deployed to help the thousands of migrant workers who were stranded to find, on Google Maps and through Google search, where food and night shelters were available. “We even allowed voice-based queries,” he said. Nvidia South Asia MD Vishal Dhupar said they are partnering with doctors to mitigate the Covid problem. AI cameras, he said, can tell if someone has high temperature. Prof RK Shevgaonkar, vice chancellor of Bennett University, said that technology has ensured that the disruptions due to Covid-19 do not destroy the world completely. Blended learning will be new normal Anant Agarwal , CEO of EdX, a learning platform founded by Harvard and MIT, said many people have now realised that online learning is okay. “These trends will stay with us into the future. Blended learning, with a combination of in-person and online classes, will become the new normal,” he said. “It’s like personalised teaching that took place in ancient times, the ones that a re mentioned in the Mahabharata and Ramayana. Princes and princesses had a chance to learn from the best sages at their own pace,” he said. Rohini Srivathsa , national technology officer at Microsoft India, said data and AI are at the base of every new technology and these would play a critical role in accelerating the pace of recovery. Sanket Baraley , the founder/CEO of FIGmd, a Google Ventures backed company that manages health data for 40% of Americans, said India presents a lot of challenges when it comes to deploying AI for social good. The fact that less than a third of India’s population has smartphones also makes AI solutions less feasible, he said.

Startups, he said, can add a lot of value by developing indigenous Indiafocused solutions. Adarsh Natarajan , founder of healthtech startup Aindra, said it would not be possible for a country like India to test its entire population of 1.3 billion and that’s where AI can play a critical role. “What really is the need of the hour is quick triaging, quick screening, using methods that are portable,” he said. Amardeep Sibia , founder, Drishya.ai, which develops AI solutions for the energy sector, said contactless tests is an area where AI can add value. Jaydeep Singh , founder of skill development platform Empass, said language benefits from AI tremendously. “It boils down to creating content which is of great quality.” AI can help manage social crisis Ajay Gupta of the Western Michigan University said in this age of disinformation, AI should be used to counter false narratives of Covid-19. “If models can be developed, AI can be really handy there. It depends on how one collects data and curates it,” he said. Rajeev Agarwal , computer scientist at Engineer Research and Development Centre under the US Army Corps of Engineers, said graph algorithms use the relationships among network nodes to learn insights to make actionable predictions. “In the last few months, many graph-related Covid-19 projects have focused on tracing connections between people, identifying clusters of elevated activity,” he said.

2020-05-20,"Wearables, AI help monitor temperatures during Covid",Aparna Desikan,"Chennai: It is no longer enough to use just a thermometer to measure temperature. As living with Covid becomes the norm, newer, tech-based ways emerging to measure temperature are emerging. Wearable startup GOQii has introduced wristbands that can measure body temperature, heart rate and blood pressure to monitor Covid 19 symptoms with a thermal sensor. With the data collected from devices, GOQii in partnership with German healthtech firm Thryve, is working on early detection of infections. Currently, the wearables tech firm has Mumbai police as its customers. “Governments, hospitals, schools, BPOs, insurance and banking companies, etc are in talks with us to use the GOQii Vital 3.0. Combined usage of the detection algorithm and the GOQii Vital 3.0 Smart Band can help significantly in isolating potential Covid-19 patients and preventing further spread,”said Vishal Gondal, founder & CEO, GOQii. With data recording facilities linked to the cloud, deep tech startups Niramai and Staqu have thermal cameras to detect temperature. The advantage they spell out is mass testing with minimum human intervention. In addition, Niramai’s solution is aimed towards enabling automated screening of population by checking not only for fever but also for respiratory abnormalities using its Thermalytix solution by running an AI algorithm on the thermal images. It monitors the temperature of all people walking into a facility remotely using infrared cameras. On this thermal stream, the company’s algorithm identifies the faces of people to detect suspected fever. “We have also integrated the fever test technology in mitra robots from Invento Robotics. They can be deployed at the entrance of a hospital for screening patients and visitors. Currently, in India, thermal screening is done using infrared forehead thermometers. This method of measuring the temperature is prone to manual errors, has the risk of cross-contamination and does not scale for a large population,” said Geetha Manjunath, co-founder and CEO, Niramai. The solution is currently pilot tested in Fortis, Bengaluru, and recently installed at the Bengaluru DCP office. Besides measuring temperature, the companies are also leveraging the data to detect masks, ensure social distancing and contact tracing. Staqu’s video analytics platform Jarvis has installed thermal sensors in the CCTV cameras in the office premises and is capturing data. “Merely measuring temperature does not suffice. Along with mass temperature measurement, our system also helps corporates comply with the new workplace guidelines issued by the government. It ensures prevention by ensuring wearing masks and social distancing too,” said Atul Rai, founder, Staqu.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/wearables-ai-help-monitor-temperatures-during-covid/articleshow/75835490.cms

Social Distancing Alert Device (SDAD), developed by Enthu Technology Solutions India Private Limited, can measure distance between people at public places, founder director of the company Moorthi Kanagaraj said. “We have incorporated AI in image processing technology to automatically identify social distance violations when people stand in queues. The device should be installed eight to 10 feet high to cover the entire crowd. It will capture the picture of the crowd once in three minutes and analyse whether there is 1.5 metre distance between each person. If the distance is not ensured, it will highlight the violator on the monitor and issue a warning,” he said. The device will be useful at ticket counters, entrance of factories, banks and companies, Kanagaraj said. “It will also issue a warning if a room gets crowded. It will send information like how many people had gathered at a particular time and how many people had violated the norms, to the back-end. Apart from ensuring compliance without human interference, it will help authorities to learn about movement of people at a particular place and their behaviour.” The firm is also developing a solution to identify those without masks and to detect their body temperature, Kanagaraj added.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/city-firm-brings-out-ai-enabled-social-distancing-detector/articleshow/75795102.cms

2020-05-06,AI-approved exams to be next big thing in remote learning,"Updated: May 6, 2020, 09:45 IST","By K K Ramachandran Chennai: The unfolding of the Covid-19 pandemic has shown academicia that there is no turning from technology and artificial intelligence. This phase of online learning, video-meetings and webinars on special topics can never be reversed and so moving ahead and cohabiting with technology is the only way forward. Since the lockdown has thrown the academic calendar off the rails, the immediate concern of college and course managers is to hold examinations and help final semester students to be job-ready or pursue higher education. The fact that Tamil Nadu has about 1.3 crore schoolchildren in about 50,000 schools of all categories will underline the mammoth task waiting to be resolved in the next few weeks. In higher education, Tamil Nadu is home to nearly 35 lakh students in 780 arts and science colleges, more than 550 engineering colleges, 37 universities and nearly 450 polytechnic institutes. Given the numbers, there is no way the old system of teaching can make up for the lost time. But a bunch of alert academicians see this disruption in the academic calendar as an opportunity to reassess teaching methods. That explains why many colleges and universities have decided to hold an online-only teaching-learning programme at least once a week. In the post-Covid world, traditional examinations could be seen as a red signal. Physical invigilation and manual evaluation, the logistics involving an examination centre and hard copies of answer scripts pose more challenges. More number of students means more the number of teachers, halls, papers and logistics. In contrast, online exams can be conducted remotely with either an AI-based algorithm or an AI-assisted human proctor. This means a professor will be assisted by an AI algorithm to invigilate the credibility of his class. AI-driven tools take over the invigilation role even as the candidate keys in the answers in an anywhere-any-time examination pattern. The keyboard movement, eyeball movement and audio sensors will be able to remotely monitor the candidate. Any unusual behaviour or deviation from the screen in front is notified on a real-time basis. Attempt to commit fraud results in instant freeze of keys. Auto-grading tools are available to assess performance effectively and with accuracy. To check that the computer being used to take the exam is not misused to browse for answers, ports can also be disabled of external devices, a monitoring software can ensure navigation control and internet browsing is blocked, and no other unauthorised software is working at the back. If the AI proctor finds any suspicious activity, it will raise a flag that will reflect on the professor’s screen in real-time. To ensure there are no leaks of questions, the paper too could be computer-generated, making the entire process is AI-approved assessment, invigilation and evaluation. As assessment levels of learning outputs change, it is important that the inputs too are different, and it is not just a mere shift of the physical classroom online. While some argue that the teacher-student interaction will be affected, the challenge is in content creation and making the topics tech-friendly. The onus of innovation is on the teachers, who need to do more than create a power point presentation of a lesson for a virtual classroom. For instance, when teaching live, interactive tools that provide a question poll or a link that further elucidates a concept has to be incorporated. Higher educational institutes and universities must develop their own platforms so external dependence is minimal, and the initiative is economical. To start with, the syllabus should be made available in electronic format and should be enabled to use tech tools available. Tamil Nadu government has allocated nearly Rs40,000 crore for education this year with huge sums being set aside for technology, smart learning and e-labs. The pandemic has merely reminded administrators about the huge outlay at their disposal to be used for tech upgradation and making the students e-ready for future challenges. It hardly stops with distribution of laptops free of cost. Instead of being overawed by the lockdown and losing academic days, the bureaucracy and academicia should focus on creating e-content on apps and then ready colleges and schools for online assessments. If they are slack in achieving this, the whole space will be taken over by private entities, startups and corporates. Once such a digital divide is allowed, it can never be bridged.

2020-04-30,AI software to detect Covid-19 patients,TNN,"Representative image COIMBATORE: The students of Sri Ramakrishna Engineering College have come up with an artificial intelligence (AI) software that could find out if one is positive for Covd-19 with a chest x-ray. It could also detect severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and pneumonia. According to the students, the software could identify distinct patterns that coronavirus cause in a patient’s lungs. “So, it can easily detect if one is positive before symptoms manifest.” They say the novel coronavirus usually enters through a person’s nose or mouth, then attaches itself to his/her throat and travels down to lungs, before entering bronchioles and alveoli. Sometimes, symptoms take 14 to 18 days to manifest that too when the patient’s immune system starts reacting. Kirupasankar, a student who was part of the team that developed the software, says, “When the virus enters the lungs, it causes certain changes. The patches have distinct notches and nodes, which could be picked up in the x-ray. The AI software will examine a picture in every x-ray 224 times and identify if it is Covid-19 or not.” He said the software was developed with deep learning technology, which is advanced and could be improved to have an accuracy rate of 99.25%. Doctors, however, say the new technologies have to be studied for years before using as a testing or screening method. Dr Nirmala, dean, ESI Hospital, says, “From close to 250 patients that we have seen, only 1%-2% of them had changes in the lung x-rays before symptoms manifest. In fact, a majority of asymptomatic and some symptomatic patients do not have changes in their lung x-ray.” Referring to the AI software, she said such a technology has to be proven by successfully identifying thousands of patients over a period of time, before they could use that. “As of now, only real time polymerase chain reaction antigen test is recommended for screening or diagnosis of Covid-19.” The students say they have also developed an android app named Mithran, which if allowed, would use geo mapping technology to tell you the places you have been, if you have been in contact with a Covid-19 patient and if you need to quarantine yourself.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/ai-software-to-detect-covid-19-patients/articleshow/75459407.cms
2020-04-27,AI-driven app tracks Covid patient’s contacts,Arshad Afzaal Khan,"Representative image AYODHYA: After a woman tested positive for covid-19 last week, the first coronavirus case in Ayodhya since its outbreak in India, police have swiftly tracked her contacts over a 90-day period through an Artificial Intelligence-driven ‘virus protection application’ to quickly isolate, quarantine and curb virus spread. The App saves the hassle of questioning the patient or rummaging through her phone book, unlike the case of celeb singer Kanika Kapoor, where precious time was lost in forming a 1000-strong police team to track those in her contact coupled with the infection ripple effect. Ayodhya police is running this exercise through a recently developed app developed by a team of IT professionals headed by Ayodhya SSP Ashish Tiwari , an IIT alumnus. Talking to TOI, Tiwari said, “We put the mobile number of an infected person on the app, which quickly maps areas where the patient visited along with mobile numbers of those who came in contact with the patient over a 90-day period. Also, the algorithm quickly even shows those came in proximity to the patient’s contacts.” The Virus Protection App can zero in on precise locations, coordinates, movement and other activities of an infected person’s contacts, who can be quickly quarantined.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/ai-driven-app-tracks-covid-patients-contacts/articleshow/75397099.cms
2020-04-21,Experts study advanced AI nCov scanning,Yagnesh Bharat Mehta,"Surat: With an aim to prevent doctors from getting infected with coronavirus, a mother-daughter medico-technical team studied the AI-based Covid scanning to identify infection in a patient at the preliminary stage without any physical intervention of a doctor. In their study, the duo developed a concept that it can be verified at initial level if a person has infection through visual examination of throat by an automated AI scanner. The Study aims at prevent doctors who are already limited in numbers from getting infected from exposure to coronavirus during treatment of Covid positive patients. Dr Upena Dalal, professor in electronics department at Sardar Vallabhabhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT) and her daughter Dr Parima Dalal Parikh, a paediatrician, undertook a study of throat infections in Covid-19 patients and developed a method to examine it electronically by a AI-based scanner. The duo took a lead from Krishna Ojha and Ekta Arora, two BTech students of Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Surat, who developed an initial model of AI based Covid19 scanner. “The students’ AI-based Covid-19 scanner notices basic symptoms of sneezing, coughing, runny nose and chest X-ray. But chest infection is developed at a later stage and in that condition a patient cannot even stand properly,” explained Dr Parikh. But during their study, the duo found that tonsillitis with some specific characteristics can suggest if it is due to coronavirus. “After studying the findings of doctors and examination details of coronavirus at the initial infection stage, we arrived at a conclusion that if the AI-based scanner can notice and identify the infected throat, it will be more effective for treating it at once,” said Dr Dalal. The mother-daughter team has also shared their findings with the two IIIT students. “Now we are working on use of infra-red thermal and optical camera to examine throat infections. With this, a patient can be examined by the scanner without any doctor coming in direct contact with the infected person,” Dr Dalal added. However, the study is still on the theory table without having conducted any clinical validation as yet. The team is now working on to get support from the MHRD to develop the project at an advance level which can be used in hospitals and health centres.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/experts-study-advanced-ai-ncov-scanning/articleshow/75260368.cms
2020-04-17,IIIT Surat students develop AI Covid-19 scanner,Yagnesh Bharat Mehta,"Surat: Two budding engineers of Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Surat have shown considerable ingenuity to develop a Covid-19 scanner that helps to identify a potential patient without any need for a human to directly come in contact with the latter. The artificial intelligence-based technology has been developed by second year students of engineering while working remotely from Bikaner in Rajasthan and Ropar in Punjab, putting to best use the time available to them because of nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus. The institute is preparing to approach Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) for funds to further develop the scanner for professional use. Krishna Ojha, a student of electronics engineering, and Ekta Arora, a student of computer science, used video cameras, data of infected persons’ movements, machine learning software, ultrasonic sensor and other devices to develop the scanner remotely. Ojha is in Bikaner since March 2 as he had undergone a surgery and Arora is in Ropar since the declaration of lockdown. The scanner instructs a patient to position himself properly and studies his/her body movements for a couple of minutes. If the patient has Covid-19 symptoms like cold, cough, running nose or sneezes, the scanner immediately analyzes the data and takes the former’s x-ray. ""Many of my family members are doctors and it was shocking to know that many doctors had got infected in Rajasthan while treating Covid-19 patients. Hence, I and Ekta thought of developing a scanner that can identify a potential patient without any human having to examine him/her physically,"" Ojha told TOI over phone. ""We used x-ray data of Covid-19 patients to analyze chest infection. The scanner’s artificial intelligence itself decides if the person has infection and of what degree before issuing an alert to doctors,"" said Ojha. ""We had limited resources and it was challenging to develop the scanner while being under lockdown. The AI Covid-19 scanner can be used for examining patients after attaching it with some hi-tech medical equipment like digital x-ray scanner,” said Arora. The students submitted the project after its completion through video to faculty members of the institute. ""Our students have developed something which is needed most in the current times. After their video presentation, we decided to approach MHRD for funding to develop the AI Covid-19 scanner to advance level,"" said Upena Dalal, dean academic, IIIT.

2020-04-12,AI-based crowd analytics aid police to monitor mass gatherings in Telangana,U Sudhakar Reddy,"Picture for representational purpose only. HYDERABAD: In order to identify and prevent mass gatherings, as well as monitor the movement of people on the streets and public places during the lockdown period, the Telangana police is using crowd analytics. Around 335 cameras have been installed to identify the illegal assembly of people in city. The state has been in lockdown since March 23 and Section 144 of CrPC which prohibits the gathering of five or more than five persons in a place has been imposed. Based on the feed from the cameras, the Artificial Intelligence-based application analyses movement of people in real-time and generates alarms. “As the alarm is generated, the system sends an automatic SMS to the nearest police station with geo-location of the crowd. Police on patrol duty will rush to the spot and disperse the crowd and take necessary action,” Srinath Reddy, DSP, Telangana Police IT Cell , told STOI. From April 1 to 8, on an average, 350 to 450 alarms were issued in the city. According to data, the maximum number of alerts in the last 10 days were generated on April 4. For instance, on April 2, 10% of alarms were generated from Andhra Mahila Sabha Kamman area. It was followed by the nearby post office at Chaderghat Kaman, Imperial Garden Junction, Dilshuknagar bus stop, Hanuman Mandir Kolswadi crossroads and Aram Ghar. Telangana police department has been using the crowd analytics to keep an eye on protestors including during agitations, clashes and Assembly sessions. Telangana additional DG (law and order) Jitender told STOI, “During the Sammakka Saralakka Jatara of Medaram, we used crowd analytics. This helped us prevent stampedes and keep an eye on the flow of traffic and movement of devotees.” “We have capabilities and IT applications to keep a tab on illegal assembly, in violation of lockdown. We are also working on traffic analysis. If the number of vehicles increases in any area, that means lockdown is not implemented properly. We can immediately rectify it,” he added. “Crowd analytics help police to identify the situation and react to it immediately,” said a police officer.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ai-based-crowd-analytics-aid-police-to-monitor-mass-gatherings-in-state/articleshow/75102292.cms

2020-04-07,Indian missions in Canada deploy AI tool to address queries,TNN,"Hyderabad: The High Commission of India (HCI) in Canada and consulates in Toronto and Vancouver have been flooded with queries over the coronavirus pandemic by Persons of Indian Origin (PIO). Currently, the country has a PIO population of over 1.6 million and as many as 2,00,000 Indian students are enrolled in various Canadian institutions. To address the large number of queries, the HCI has put in place an artificial intelligence-based chat service, the CANbot. With the number of calls increasing every day, the HCI decided to get in touch with conversation platform, Verloop.io and Portea Medical, a home healthcare company, to develop the automated multilingual chatbot. Accessible from HCI’s website, the bot will be a one-stop source of information for Indian nationals, students and PIOs in Canada. The information will be provided via WhatsApp in English, Hindi and Punjabi. The chat can also be transferred to respective consulates for better resolution of queries if needed. Speaking on the launch, High Commissioner of India to Canada, Ajay Bisaria, said that HCI wanted to create a service that can assist people in this emergency. “We empathise with people’s concerns in these troubled times and the need to receive immediate and accurate information wherever they are,” the high commissioner said. “CANbot has the ability to quickly respond to the user’s questions relating to Covid-19, public safety measures taken in India and Canada and restrictions on international travel,” said CEO and MD of Portea Medical, Meena Ganesh. Elaborating on the functions of CANbot, Verloop founder Gaurav Singh said: “The CANBot will help in managing the sudden spike in conversations around travel and visa restrictions. It is a true example of how technology can be used to manage so many queries comprehensively. The automated platform will enable the HCI to handle the increased volume of calls with minimal need for human intervention.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/indian-missions-in-canada-deploy-ai-tool-to-address-queries/articleshow/75018466.cms
2020-03-27,Cameras & AI are revolutionising the retail biz: Intel's Joe Jensen,Sujit John,"Joe Jensen is Intel ’s vice president of the IoT (internet of things) Group, with specific responsibility around retail, hospitality, education and banking. But retail is what we mostly discussed; that’s where his teams are combining cameras, computer vision, IoT and AI to create some fascinating solutions. Take digital advertising boards in front of large stores. They can show a variety of offerings, but the one it shows as you pass by may be irrelevant to you. So now comes those technologies we mentioned. They can figure your gender, your approximate age, and if it is connected to the inventory system, it could show you something you might want to buy. Suppose it was an unusually dry season and the store has two new raincoats in stock. Instead of waiting until it is forced to put the raincoats on a deep discount, the screen could show the raincoat with a small discount as someone passes by. “The system can tell not just my gender but also my size. I'm a pretty big guy, so if the raincoats aren’t extra-large, it will not show me the raincoat, it will show me something else it has in stock,” Jensen says. In Australia, one of Intel’s grocery store partners was losing $5 million a month because people buying bulk products often put the wrong product code on the bag – the code for, say, peanuts, when they had bought macadamia nuts (often cheating, sometimes accidentally). Today, cameras detect the nuts and automatically label the bag. Retailers are also using such systems to handle queues, estimating the walk-ins, and predicting when the queues are likely to get too long, so that staff can be proactively redeployed. Safeway in the US, Jensen says, used the system to reduce the number of staff in the store. Kiosks at restaurants, which have become very popular, are being equipped with these tech to get people to buy more than what they otherwise would. In a fast-food place like McDonald ’s, if you order only a plain hamburger, the outlet may lose money. If you add cheese, fries and drinks, they make good money. So kiosks display some lovely looking dessert or drink while you order. If you are male, it could display an energy drink (almost all energy drinks are sold to men). “By adding cameras and analytics, you can actually optimise the experience customer by customer,” Jensen says. Walmart , he says, has been spending about 5% of revenue on IT for almost five years, almost three times of what is considered best-in-class in retail, of 1.7%. “They are at a point where their base infrastructure is fully ready to bring in new innovations. They are rolling out robots, each with 14 cameras that can even read the labels of products. They go down the aisles to measure the shelf inventory real-time, find empty spots, wrongly placed products,” says Jensen.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cameras-ai-are-revolutionising-the-retail-biz-intels-joe-jensen/articleshow/74838143.cms

She was delivering the inaugural address on the first day of two-day International AI Summit 2.0 organized by the Centre of Excellence of GH Raisoni College of Engineering (GHRCE) on AI and machine learning (ML) at its Hingna facility. Analytics director at Cognizant Technology Services Satish Raghavendran, Ajay Chaudhary, Rahul Deshmukh, GHRCE director Sachin Untawale and event coordinators professor A Thomas and Prashant Borkar were present. Manish Nair and Priyanka Sharma were the anchors. Siddappa focused on expanding the sphere of AI and why one should adapt to it. She said, “AI is certainly not that field which is going to die down soon. There is no dearth of opportunities for the next 50+ years. Once you enter this area, you can have access to latest information.” She encouraged students to discover existing problems and innovate solutions from their own base. Raghavendran exhorted students to build intellectual muzzle to generate ideas that would provide a breakthrough. “Look for problem statements in your areas of work. You need to possess the knack of focusing on right problems and have abundant curiosity. Keep it alive and kindled to be supremely successful in future,” he said. Workshops, panel discussions, keynote speeches and power talks were the among the sessions lined up on the first day of the summit. In his welcome address, Untawale said, “We have seen a transition from telecommunications to AI. Being a mechanical engineer, I was always fond of various technologies being developed in the society. Through this summit, the experts will guide us on where the world is heading in terms of AI.” “We are shifting from an outcome-based education system to an evidence-based structure of education. The basis of the former constitutes how a graduate is nurtured in an institution. The latter will have all these parameters of AI and data sciences which will be required for the education of a student based on the evidence observed in teaching and learning processes,” he said. Reading the preamble of the event, COE AI/ML in charge Gopal Sakarkar said there has been participation of more than 50 students from across Maharashtra. “The objective of holding the summit is to bring together industry, academia and research organizations to share knowledge and opportunities available in the emerging area of AI,” he said.

2020-03-06,"AI to study bee-haviour, help form corridor in urban setting",Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay,"KOLKATA: A conservationist-turned-entrepreneur has developed an artificial intelligence system in collaboration with Hidco to closely monitor beehives so that diseases do not wipe out bee colonies. Arijit Das, the man behind the mission, has chosen Eco Park to start with his experiment of forming a bee corridor. “Around 90% of food we consume will not be there if bees disappear. They play a huge role in pollination of flowers. Thus, conservation of bees is of prime importance since climate change is causing extinction of many species,” said Das, who has set up Schoppen Solutions, a start-up, to form a viable business model. According to Das, only steady production of honey can sustain bees and their hives. The biggest threat to their existence is infection. Diseases wipe out colonies and honey production hits rock bottom. “The colour of bees is their health indicator. I monitor the change in colour and deformity in their body almost round the clock. My system generates alert the moment any anomaly is detected. The interventions are taken note of immediately,” said Das. The bee corridor strives to successfully weave environment and technology together. At Eco Park, wooden boxes have been kept in a row stretching to a distance of 100 metres. There are 17 boxes as of now, which will later be increased once the colony expands and honey extraction increases. Since Rajarhat has been developed as a green city with urban edifices and pre-planned green landscapes, having such corridors would also bring in a rural flavour within the urban setting. The project in unique from the perspective of bee cultivation at urban ecosystem with the aim of livelihood development for people around the place. From an environmental point of view, such efforts will restore balance of the bee population that is under threat, said Arnab Basu, IT committee chairman of the Bengal Chamber , which has incubated the venture along with Webel. Hidco chairman and additional chief secretary Debashis Sen said it was possible to have a honey production centre in the urban backdrop. “Such a centre with minimum effort and with a dose of technology could generate revenues and improve income of thousands. Honey and nectar productions in villages and city peripheries — around Joka in south and Salt Lake and Rajarhat up north — could raise the income levels of villagers at least 10%. In the city, one can cultivate bees in balconies if one stays close to some garden,” he said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ai-to-study-bee-haviour-help-form-corridor-in-urban-setting/articleshow/74500075.cms
2020-03-03,Tamil Nadu medical university to use AI to curb malpractice in exams,TNN,"Representative image CHENNAI: In an attempt to curb malpractice and improve surveillance during examinations, the state medical university will launch an indigenous artificial intelligence-driven system, which can monitor examination venues real-time and prompt officials about “suspected” malpractices. The project will be piloted in May for the postgraduate medical examination and will be used from August for UG examination. The technology can provide directions through instant alerts during exams, university vice-chancellor Dr Sudha Sehayyan said on Monday. The university, in association with the Madras Chamber of Commerce, is working on a software that will raise an alarm when it senses interaction between two students in the exam centre, passing of answer scripts, moving of seats or any other abnormal movement during the examination. “We are hoping to make the process more stringent to reduce malpractices. We can debar colleges from holding exams and students too will be asked to repeat examinations or be debarred if malpractices are detected,” she said. In February, the university had asked 35 exam centres holding MBBS exams in the state to livestream the tests. A team of officials were monitoring the livestreams from a control room in Guindy as 12,000 students wrote their semester exams. While it did help in creating a feeling that they were being watched, it was not adequate to catch malpractice such as mass copying or using gadgets to find answers. The medical university conducts examination for medical, dental, AYUSH (ayurveda, yoga & naturopathy, unani, siddha and homoeopathy) and other medical-related streams in around 500 centres. Medical students are given bar-coded answer scripts and question papers are sent to examination centres half an hour before the examinations. Exam centres must download the question papers using a unique password and print them out only minutes before they hand it over to the students to prevent any leaks. The universities will also send a digital footage of the examination hall to the university for reference.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/state-med-univ-to-use-ai-to-curb-malpractice-in-exams/articleshow/74449159.cms

2020-02-26,AI can pick candidates even before they apply for a job,TNN,"By Chaitanya Sreenivas Ever since ‘personnel administration’ came into being in the 1900s, it has continuously evolved, more so in the last decade. Now human resources (HR) no longer pertains to merely hiring, assessing & compensating employees, but is intrinsic in achieving the business goals of an organisation. Emerging technologies that disrupted traditional business models have permeated HR too. Technology is becoming vital to HR as it moves closer to business and HR leaders expect it to play a strategic role. Among the emerging technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) signals an HR technology step change, as it can create an impact across the entire talent management life cycle. AI across talent management life cycle An organisation can apply AI in almost any area of HR, be it to attract & hire candidates or to engage, retain & develop skills of current employees. AI tools can pinpoint high-potential candidates even before they apply for a job. With specialised chatbots, AI — powered by natural language processing — can help attract talent by enabling prospective candidates to learn more about the organisation and answer any other queries they have. Thus, enhancing the candidate’s experience during the ‘attract’ phase. AI can enable efficient and effective recruitment by predicting the time taken to fill a vacancy by analysing historical data. So, recruiters can prioritise the open positions they need to fill and do not hastily hire the wrong candidates. It can also predict the future performance of a candidate by analysing the data submitted in the job application, resume and job requisition. Moreover, AI can assist in putting together more inclusive job descriptions and filter candidates minimising unintended bias in the recruitment process. During the ‘engage’ phase, AI offers two important use cases — talent alerts and engagement analysis. AI talent alerts are essentially notifications for first-line managers that provide insights about their team members by sifting through employee data available within the organisation. AI engagement analysis is a technology that analyses unstructured data from employee surveys and social media chatter within a corporate firewall. At the ‘retain’ phase, AI can aid in smarter compensation planning. HR teams need to consider several factors like market rate for different skill sets, the demand for these skills and the approach to reward performance in base pay or bonus. Above all, AI can accelerate skill development at individual employee-level while optimising learning at the organisation-level. The most promising aspect of AI deployment is in the real-time inference of skills. AI-based skills inference can support organisations in spotting high-potential employees. Today, most of the innovation-led organisations are using AI to mitigate biases and enhance diversity & inclusion (D&I). AI as a tool to alleviate bias and bolster D&I In any organisation, several types of biases tend to creep in due to a variety of reasons, whether consciously or subconsciously. Cognitive biases happen when employees allow systematic irrational judgments into their thinking and reasoning. In such cases, they may indulge in stereotyping, confirmation bias (tendency to search or interpret information in a way that confirms one’s preconceptions) or self-serving bias (propensity to blame external factors for failure and claim credit for success). Bias in everyday work life could manifest into micro-aggression where employees resort to verbal or non-verbal slights and hostile communication due to bias against gender, ethnicity or disability. Whatever be the reasons, biases prevent an organisation from building a truly diverse and inclusive workplace. Mitigating these biases is crucial for organisations to ensure compliance and foster an environment of innovation and healthy competition wherein employees can grow. This is where AI plays a role. Unlike human beings, machines do not suffer from inherent biases, but are subject to the choices of data and algorithmic features chosen by the people building them. AI can remove the attributes that lead to biases. It can also learn how to detect potential biases, particularly those unconscious ones that are unintentional and hard to uncover in the decision-making processes. AI can ensure the right-fit candidates have equal access to job opportunities and support HR in making fair hiring decisions. Road map to imbue AI in HR Before an organisation introduces AI into its HR system, it can start with identifying the business case. What are the business problems they intend to solve? Who are the people who need this problem solved, and will they commit to it in their profit & loss reporting? Then the business case should spell out the minimum viable product (MVP). The next step is for the organisation to decide if it can build its own AI applications or procure them off-the-shelf. Irrespective of whether it decides to buy or build, deploying AI capability in the cloud is the best way forward. An organisation should remember that the faster it deploys the MVP, the sooner it can deliver the next improved iteration. Finally, if the MVP rollout is successful, it should contemplate enterprise-wide adoption by leveraging design thinking and agile working models. If an organisation wants to test the waters and not commit to using AI, chatbots can be a starting point. HR can choose a process that generates many questions from employees and deploy a chatbot based on a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs). Chatbots are inexpensive and non-technical HR staff can manage them. The bottom line is that ‘strategic HR’ has to come into the play wherein the focus moves from administrative practices to high-performance HR practices concentrated on key jobs and groups of workers. AI has a substantial role to play in making HR strategic and, fortunately for CHROs, it has become more accessible.

Speaking at the World Education Summit organised by Elets, a digital education platform, B Shafiullah, secretary of Telangana Minority Residential Education Institutions Society, said that they will be introducing AI and robotics as part of the curriculum in all minority schools from the ensuing academic year. “We will be introducing modules on artificial intelligence and robotics for which we have partnered with Indian Institute of Technology-Hyderabad and Duck Learning Labs (Singapore) to develop content that can be imparted to students,” said Shafiullah. The government is also planning to introduce new courses on artificial intelligence, data sciences and data analytics in degree colleges in the ensuing academic year. A committee has been constituted by the Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) to look into the anomalies in introducing the new courses. Discussions are rife over introduction of bachelor of science courses into AI, machine learning, blockchain technology, data sciences, data analytics, etc. “On a pilot basis, these courses will first be introduced in government and autonomous degree colleges, following which we will extend them to other private colleges as well. These courses will be of 30 credits likely to be divided in six semesters,” said an official on the sidelines of the two-day summit. Given the errors in declaring results in the last academic year, the Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education (TSBIE) has decided to implement AI-based evaluation system from the academic year 2020-21. “The evaluation process will involve computer reading of OMR sheets and intelligent character recognition. After the OMR sheets are evaluated, the descriptive answer sheets will be scanned using ICR to verify marks allotted by each evaluator,” said Syed Omar Jaleel, chief executive officer and secretary of TSBIE, adding that in the final stage, AI will be deployed to check the accuracy of both OMR and ICR. Apart from this, TSBIE has decided to generate audio and video content for the curriculum which can be screened at virtual classrooms that the board intends to extend to 100 more colleges in the ensuing academic year.

Speaking at an International Conference on ‘Arbitration in the Era of Globalisation’, organised by Indian Council of Arbitration and FICCI, the CJI said, “As we conceptualise international arbitration in a globalised era, we must also be cognisant of the synergistic opportunities available for international arbitration through utilisation of disruptive technologies.” “Artificial Intelligence could provide immense benefits for the arbitration process and its users. By augmenting human cognitive abilities, AI powered services could assist lawyers in drafting, identification of better authorities, reviewing documents etc. It is also well placed to assist arbitral tribunals in preparation of award, simultaneous judicial review, streamlining case management etc. AI-based analytics system could be used to predict costs, duration and possible resolution including proposing a range of settlement based on analysis of previous arbitrations of similar size and complexity. AI-assisted arbitration holds immense promise for the arbitration community,” he said. On January 24, CJI Bobde had said he was looking to employ AI, which reads one million characters per second, in judiciary to help judges get gist of voluminous petitions quickly and propel the pace of case disposal. With the three-tier justice delivery system crawling under the heavy load of nearly three crore cases, he had said, “The AI systems we are currently looking to employ in courts, possesses reading speed of one million characters per second. I can imagine a system similar to this can be used to read and extract all relevant facts, compute tax effect and assist in a myriads of new ways to propel the pace of decision-making.” Speaking at the 79th Foundation Day function of Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), he had said, “Understanding the nature of the matters decided by the Tribunal, artificial intelligence can play a very significant role in docket management and decision-making.” On use of AI by other jurisdictions, the CJI said, “I find it reassuring to discover that more nations are taking steps towards experimenting and implementing AI in their respective justice delivery systems. This goes to say that we are doing and must continue to do everything in order to tackle with the workload in judicial process. AI, as I see, brings new hope to drive the public faith in our (judicial) institutions.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/artificial-intelligence-could-help-in-arbitration-in-globalised-era-says-cji/articleshow/74037271.cms

A team of officials are monitoring the live streams from a control room in Guindy. Some 12,000 students are writing the exams this year. In 2019, the university barred two self-financing colleges — Madha Medical College and Hospital and Melmaruvathur Adiparasakthi Medical College — from conducting MBBS examinations after CCTV footage showed mass copying by students with even invigilators helping them out in some cases. An inquiry committee found students exchanging notes, passing answer scripts and dictating answers at the exam hall. This year, students of Madha Medical College are writing their exam at the university campus, while students Melmaruvathur college have been given a separate examination centre. “The second and third year examinations are going on now. They are being live streamed,” said university vice-chancellor Dr Sudha Seshayyan. The colleges will have to send the complete video footage of the examinations, she said. “We will caution or warn centres from the control room if we see any malpractice. We have started live streaming from Monday,” she said. The university, she said was in talks with companies for an artificial intelligence-driven system which can monitor examination venues in real-time. Technology is available to provide proactive automated directions through instant alerts during exams. “We are hoping to make the process more stringent to reduce malpractices. We can debar colleges from holding exams and students too will be asked to repeat examinations or be debarred if malpractices are detected,” she said. Students are given bar-coded answer scripts for the exams. Question papers are now sent to examination centres half an hour before the examination.

Sautoy began by talking about the stories that science can tell. “Science requires precision but also huge amount of imagination,” he said. “Mathematics in India used to be written in poetic form – mathematics was poetry and there is poetry in mathematics.” Highlighting the important role of AI in our lives, Sautoy addressed the fear of this new technology taking over. “But we believe AI will never be able to do is match human creativity, after all isn’t it an expression of our inner soul,” he says. “But in this decade, it seems AI might show signs of creative acts. How long before we have a piece of AI telling us at JLF, telling us about its new novel? It’s not so far away.” Sautoy also argued that literature can be a way to give empathy for humans. “Literature gives us a way to understand each other,” he says. “We are worried whether AI really understand us. We want AI to be our side, and I think it is through stories that we can find a pathway together as collaborators and not competitors.” Mudgal spoke on art and creativity through a fable of a king who wanted to sculpt, but was told by a sage to first learn the basic of painting, instrumental and vocal music. “It illustrates the overarching significance of an interdisciplinary approach in the Indian tradition,” she said. “It illustrates the vast scope and many directions in which one can journey with the arts. Calling creativity “an exercise in extending the boundaries of your chosen discipline”, Mudgal ended the session on a melodious rendition of a Sahir Ludhianvi poem .",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/time-not-far-when-ai-may-be-telling-us-about-its-novel-at-jlf-sautoy/articleshow/73564400.cms

The proposal is pending with the state government since one year despite the need for the technological infrastructure which is crucial to control law and order and traffic violations as well. “Projects proposed in the interest of the city, especially the ones related to security, will be given top priority. Plans pending with the government will be verified and cleared as soon as possible,” said Maharashtra minister Nitin Raut. Mayor Sandip Joshi said he would also take up the issue with the government. “I will talk to NSSCDCL chairman Praveen Pardeshi and the BMC commissioner. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis had approved the project during his tenure as chief minister. I will discuss the proposed works with Fadnavis and approach the government by taking his help. The issue needs to be taken up seriously,” he said. Fadnavis had approved Rs520 crore for the project. L & T was awarded the project on October 18, 2016 for operation and maintenance for five years. Around 3,700 CCTVs were installed at 660 junctions across the city. All CCTVs are connected with the optical fibre network of 1,200km range. NSSCDCL developed City Operation and Centre at the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) head office where feed from all CCTVs can be seen simultaneously. It came to the notice of NMC, NSSCDCL and police that some more junctions, T-points situated between major squares also need to be covered under CCTV surveillance. Accordingly, a survey was conducted and the need arose to install an additional 3,000 CCTVs at 500 junctions. The cost for the implementation of this plan is pegged at Rs150 crore. With the help of CCTVs, traffic police started trapping violators. But the hurdle is personnel having to to sit in City Operation Centre to identify them. The traffic police requested NSSCDCL to install AI so that traffic violations can be automatically detected and notice served to violators. The NSSCDCL, too, proposed this plan. A huge quantum of feed comes from 3,700 CCTVs. The feed is proving to be beneficial in detecting crimes and identifying criminals. But the storage of footage is limited to just 15 days. Police and NMC suggested an increase in the storage capacity. Accordingly, NSSCDCL proposed to increase the storage capacity to 90 days. These installations are likely to cost around Rs50 crore. NSSCDCL had submitted the proposals with the directorate of information technology (DIT) which is nodal agency for the Safe and Smart City Project. The government needs to make provision for funds to enable DIT to clear the plans. Even smalls towns like Kamptee, Butibori and Hingna which are situated on the outskirts of the city are covered under the project. Under the same project, the police is being provided five drones and mobile surveillance vehicles to maintain law and order during rallies, mass gatherings, winter session of the state assembly, riots and natural disasters.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/adds-3000-cctvs-ai-90-days-storage-await-govt-nod-since-a-yr/articleshow/73397345.cms

2020-01-18,"IBM to become AI, multi-cloud player globally",TNN,"Kolkata: Over a century-old IBM has kick-started the process to transform itself into a major artificial intelligence ( AI ) player in consonance with the rising demands from international business giants. The computer hardware major is eager to gain a foothold in the Indian market by reaching out to leading companies here with a new business model based on data strategy. Inderpal Bhandari , global chief data officer of IBM, told TOI that currently, IBM’s clientele in the data business sector stems from about 19 business sectors, including banking, finance, supply chain and retail. The internal business assessment shows growth of revenues in cloud and cognitive software segment and global business services provided by IBM, which has been on a “digital reinvention mode”. “The ladder to AI enterprise is our prescriptive approach to enable clients to link data with AI in a unified platform. This also helps them understand where to put more focus on their business,” said Bhandari, who flew down to the city on Monday for the Indo-French workshop on data science (statics and AI) at Indian Statistical Institute (ISI). On IBM’s future business plans pertaining to data strategy, Bhandari added, “In the changing business world, data can fetch revenues to any technology giant like IBM when it is monetised. With the new concept of data strategy, new products can be rolled out. We are placing our bets on being the world class leader in AI and hybrid multi-cloud business.” However, Bhandari called for a change in the workflow of leading business firms across India. “There is no denying the fact that the concept of AI is not clear to many people. But it is time for all to realize that the new system can simplify a business process by saving time and resources,” said Bhandari. As for the Personal Data Protection Bill introduced in Parliament in December, last year, Bhandari said, “We welcome the decision and look forward to a progressive bill that strikes a balance and protecting privacy and harnessing data and technology to expand the economic opportunity for the people of India.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ibm-to-become-ai-multi-cloud-player-globally/articleshow/73340974.cms

Over the past three days, experts have been discussing how artificial intelligence is proving to be more effective in spotting breast cancer from mammograms than expert radiologists. AI outperformed specialists by detecting cancers that radiologists missed in the images and also junked features they falsely flagged as possible tumours. “If AI can make breast screening more effective and ease the burden on health services where radiologists are in short supply, it will help systems diagnose women in early stages of the disease and improve treatment,” she said, delivering the Dr S Krishnamurthi Centenary Memorial Oration on ‘Cancer in India: Challenges and Opportunities.’ The oration was organised by the Cancer Institute, Adyar. Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women after cervical cancer. The incidence of breast cancer is increasing, particularly among women in urban areas of Tamil Nadu. “In the rural areas, screening of cervical cancer has substantially improved with health workers screening women with simple tests using acetic acid. Besides radiology, state can use tele-pathology for confirmation as well,” she told a hall filled with doctors, medical students and social workers. Further, if single dose of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine proves to be as good as two or three injections at preventing cervical cancer in the ongoing research, it may make the World Health Organization’s goal of eliminating cervical cancer easier, she said. The vaccine is now given in at least two doses, but a single dose vaccine will make it easier for countries like India. While an Indian pharamaceutical company is in the final stages of clinically testing a HPV vaccine, research programmes in India should focus on better collection of data through cancer registries across the country and interpretation of data for stronger policies, she said. For instance, effective policies to bring down tobacco use can bring down incidence of cancer substantially. Now, tobacco use is considered the leading risk factor for cancers in India, besides dietary factors, alcohol, air pollution and obesity. “Though we have a robust cancer registry, there is no data coming from states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh,” said. She further added that the Centre’s promise to invest more money in research should be directed to understand the genetic and environmental determinants of cancer.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cancer-ai-can-make-up-for-lack-of-doctors-says-expert/articleshow/73103828.cms

2019-12-14,AI will not replace judicial decision making: Bobde,Vaibhav Ganjapure,"Nagpur: Allaying apprehensions over use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde said that the judicial decision-making process will not be substituted and its use would be limited for streamlining the administrative system. “We need to introduce technology. The system we’re looking to bring in has a reading speed of about 10 lakh words per second. It means it can read anything, you can ask any question and it will answer. The Ayodhya case had thousands of documents and equal number of pages of evidence and would have become easy to scan if AI would have been used,” the CJI said during a felicitation ceremony organized by the High Court Bar Association (HCBA) at the high court ground here on Saturday. Justice Bobde was felicitated by former CJI Rajendra Lodha in the presence of many from the legal fraternity. Sitting SC judge from the Nagpur bar, Bhushan Gavai, presided over the function, while former SC judge Vikas Sirpurkar shared the dais along with senior administrative judge Ravi Deshpande, HCBA president Gauri Venkatraman and secretary Prafulla Khubalkar. Quoting President Ramnath Kovind, Justice Bobde said the cost of justice had become prohibitive. “Obviously, no one can have a grievance against anyone making money. But please understand that when it happens in courts, it somehow blocks the access to justice and that is a serious defect,” he said. Calling the lawyers to shake their traditional approach, Justice Bobde said they shouldn’t be simply be viewed as service providers for legal services. “We need to introduce pre-litigation mediation with provision of agreement having force of decree which will require a law. I don’t believe that it would anyway reduce earning of the bar.” Expressing surprise over the fact that none of the universities prescribes course in mediation, Justice Bobde said that Nagpur, Mumbai and other law universities “are requested to start such programmes”. Cautioning the legal community against hazards of health, the CJI said a demanding lifestyle often had grave consequences on health. “I’ve witnessed a continuing rise in demand and pressures that law as profession imposes on its practitioners. Justice Lodha once said that one year of practice in SC is equivalent to five years of life.” Justice Bobde said very little attention has been paid to mental health. “Unfortunately, an enormous social stigma, shame and fear attached to mental health so much that even discussions are dealt with extreme contempt and ridicule. It’s important to understand that mental health is more crucial than physical health,” he said. Responding to his felicitation, Bobde said he was deeply rooted in Nagpur. “I have an association with the people who brought me up professionally. There is greatness in HCBA here which only few bars in India could boast of. I never thought that I will sit on the CJI’s chair. Nagpur continuous to produce finest legal minds, but I am yet to see any Nagpurian as an attorney general. I don’t know why senior lawyer Harish Salve (a Nagpurian) is spending time in England,” he said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ai-will-not-replace-judicial-decision-making-bobde/articleshow/72625892.cms

The census, scheduled in May 2020, will be using digital photo analysis and technologies based on artificial intelligence. This will be the first time for such methods to be used in the lion census. Earlier, such advanced methods to count animals was used in the tiger census. During the meeting of the state wildlife board, use of latest technology in the lion census was proposed. The board immediately approved the proposal. A senior forest department officer said that the WII has developed a software to eliminate any duplicate entries based on identification marks on the body, or by face recognition. The WII software can identify individual lions based on vibrissae ( long stiff facial hairs and whiskers) patterns and other permanent body marks enabling the creation of a long-term database of individual lion sightings. The officer said that in the past the department used to give sheets to field persons who recorded identification marks on individual sketches of lions and also took photographs. This sometimes led to multiple entries of the same lion, but with the latest software, such duplication can be eliminated and the census count can be reached quicker and with greater certainty.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/forest-department-to-use-ai-in-lion-census/articleshow/72498226.cms

It analyses the sentiments and offers insights on whether a message can have a positive or negative effect on business. Other service providers like Ozonetel, a cloud telephony solution provider, run text-based sentiment analysis on chats and emails. “We track emotions like anger, sadness, happy, fear, surprise and neutral. Most of customers are worried about anger, and our service lets calls labeled as ‘angry’ to be escalated to the manager. We have achieved an accuracy rate of 95% in tracking the correct emotion so far,” Chaitanya Chokkareddy, Chief Innovation Officer, said. Variants like pitch, energy features in a call are used to build the training model, he adds. Besides analyzing calls, e-mails and chats, these solutions also track text, like Twitter trends, with demand for this solution high among e-commerce companies. IBM Watson Tone Analyzer draws results from the tone of the content. “IBM Watson Personality Insights can analyze and provide insights into the personality characteristics, needs and values through expressions in written text. This solution helps understand the personality type, habits and preferences of a person at an individual level. This solution helps gain deeper insights about the personality type of their prospective students, through their social media history, while parallely reviewing their application. This in turn augments the admission committee’s expertise to shortlist relevant applicants from the numerous applications received much faster, thereby making the entire admission process more efficient,” Vishal Chahal of IBM India Software Labs, said. NoBroker.com, a user of the tool, said the AI picks up the sentiment behind a complaint received across mediums, and automatically forwards the mail to the concerned department. “In the final stage, the concerned department head have two choices, to either address the complaint or escalate to the top management, for the complaint to be addressed with an effective solution,” Akhil Gupta, co-founder and CTO, NoBroker.com, said. Bajaj Allianz General Insurance also applies sentiment analysis to inbound calls at the service contact centers, and uses it to soft skills, call etiquettes, and complaint resolution, among others.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/emotional-ai-decodes-customer-grievances/articleshow/72497981.cms
2019-12-12,"UP cops using artificial intelligence & mobile application to outwit criminals, maintain vigil",TNN,"Representative image LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh police are using artificial intelligence (AI) to outwit criminals and keep a close eye on them. The cops are relying on video wall to maintain round-the-clock vigil on criminals lodged in jails and a mobile application to keep a database of law-breakers. According to cops, ‘Trinetra App’ (or the third eye), is a mobile application which uses artificial intelligence for face recognition of criminals. The application can be used in any Android mobile phone. The app is equipped with biometric record analysis, phonetic search and gang analysis to zero in on criminals in a quick and targeted manner. Inspector general of police, (law and order) Praveen Kumar said: “Both these technologies will not only act as deterrent but also help in prevention of crime.” Explaining the utility of video wall, director general (prisons) Anand Kumar said, “UP is the first state to implement such a technology to keep an eye on jail inmates. We have established a video wall at prisons headquarters in Lucknow which is linked to about 2,750 CCTV cameras installed in prisons across the state. The CCTVs are equipped with AI which, on noticing any unusual activity inside jails, will not only display it on video wall but also trigger an alarm.” “The alarm is linked to the mobile phones of jail superintendents so that they can act swiftly,” he added. Speaking about ‘Trinetra App’, additional director general of police (technical services) Asim Arun said the application had the database of over 5 lakh criminals bringing together the records of state police and government railway police (GRP). “Cops can use this technology to identify criminals through their face and photographs along with his/her criminal antecedents. The mobile app can also tell the gang to which a criminal belongs just at the press of a button,” added Arun.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cops-using-ai-mobile-application-to-outwit-criminals-maintain-vigil/articleshow/72482596.cms
2019-12-09,Tamil Nadu: Government schools to teach artificial intelligence from 2020,Aditi R,"CHENNAI: Soon, government school curriculum will include a course on artificial intelligence so students are well versed with new technology. The department of school education said it will introduce the course from Classes VI to IX across all government schools in a phased manner starting next academic year. “Many students find [artificial intelligence] interesting and have touched upon this subject through science projects. Once it becomes a part of the curriculum, they will be able to explore in depth,” said a senior official. The department is in talks with tech giants such as Microsoft and Google to help create a comprehensive course on AI depending on the class. It is also considering making the course an elective. Class VI students will be introduced to basics of information and communication technology and AI and the course builds on this as students progress through to higher classes. Students will have access to all required resources and will get an opportunity to work with experts. The department is also planning to recruit new teachers, who will also be trained by experts from partnering tech-giants, for the course. It is also working on improving infrastructure for AI learning. The state had announced last year that it would set up well-equipped hi-tech labs and smart classrooms in 6,000 government schools across the state at a cost of Rs 462.62 crore. “Most schools now have these labs and the project is underway in the others. It will be completed shortly,” the official said. While many private schools in the city are slowly devoting more attention to major topics under AI and computer science, the same is not the case at government schools. Many still lack internet facility, ICT hardware and basic computer science-related infrastructure. This, teachers said, is creating a digital divide between students in government and private schools. A Unesco study on ‘Artificial Intelligence in Education’ pointed out that AI provides equitable and inclusive access to education for all while helping advance collaborative learning. Though a few government schools occasionally tie up with organisations to teach advanced computer skills, educators believe making it a part of the curriculum would be more beneficial. Dinesh Kumar, who teaches robotics and computer science at PCKG government higher secondary school — where three students recently created a portable biometric voting system that can help voters exercise their franchise any time and anywhere — said making this subject a part of the curriculum would encourage more students to learn and apply important concepts to their daily lives. “Students will also be able to advance their skills and make better projects that benefit society,” said P Ezhilarasi, assistant headmistress of government girls high school T Nagar.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/govt-schools-to-teach-ai-from-2020/articleshow/72430273.cms
2019-12-09,Kolkata: AI-integrated cameras to keep vigil on Eco Park lake,TNN,"KOLKATA: The Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) will soon introduce artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance safety measures to prevent accidents at the main Eco Park lake that covers 112 acres. The move comes in the wake of an accident last month when a four year old accidentally drowned in one of the water bodies inside Eco Park. The authorities have been working for the past few months to integrate artificial intelligence with the CCTV system in the park. The system will instantly alert those in the control room about any person who ventures close to the water body. “Experts are conducting the necessary trials and tests before the system can be introduced,” said a Hidco official. Explaining how the system will work, officials said all the CCTV cameras keeping watch on the lake will be geo-tagged with artificial intelligence. “Officials in the control room will get instant alerts and live video as soon any human crossing the nylon rope fence and ventures too close to the main lake. The life guards and disaster management team that keep an eye on the lake will then be immediately alerted,” an official said. There are 135 CCTV cameras surrounding the main lake and the authorities are in the process of setting up more such cameras inside the park. “Once introduced for the main lake, the system will be extended to all the other water bodies inside Eco Park in phases,” the official added. Since November 19, Hidco has suspended boats and water rides in Eco Park to conduct emergency repairs and maintenance work. The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA), on their part, has already started using artificial intelligence and video analytics to detect bad roads in the township. “The initial results are quite satisfactory and plans are on to use the technology in a widespread manner across New Town, specially for detecting potholes in the inner lanes,” said an official.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ai-integrated-cameras-to-keep-vigil-on-eco-park-lake/articleshow/72430331.cms
2019-12-03,Know how a diploma in Machine Learning & AI can boost your career:The upGrad Way,Ariba Khaliq,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), being one of the most significant technological developments of recent times, is disrupting life unlike many other fields so swiftly that we don’t even realise what we are experiencing. Take Machine Learning for example, a subset of AI, ML is an enabler for Big Data. Its applications range from computer vision to speech recognition and translation to marketing, and drug discovery makes it one of the fastest-growing sectors in India. Big Data Analytics application is expected to witness an eight-fold growth by 2025, to cross $16 billion from the current $2 billion, according to NASSCOM. By upskilling yourself in the field of ML, you can find top-notch jobs in government, healthcare, transportation, and more sectors — virtually any business that wants to make predictions, and has a large enough data set, can use Machine Learning to achieve their goals. What is the reason behind such exponential growth? ML blurs the lines between the digital and physical worlds, creating new opportunities for digital businesses, leading to its high demand. With the digital world largely imitating the physical world, the latter produces huge volumes of data through digitally-enabled ecosystems, making machine learning super useful. Its algorithms can do the analysis of targeted user behaviour patterns and have search requests to make suggestions as well as recommendations. Let’s learn it with the help of a few examples: Vision : Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) applied to image processing can help you implement face recognition functionalities. One great example is Yelp, which uses machine learning algorithms to help the company’s human staff to compile, categorize, and label images tens of millions of photos. Language : One particular use of machine intelligence that is quickly gaining traction is the implementation of sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining. Whether you prefer to have Twitter show you “the best tweets first” (whatever that means) or as a reasonably chronological timeline, these changes are being driven by Twitter’s machine learning technology. Twitter’s AI evaluates each tweet in real-time and “scores” them according to various metrics. Audio : Speech recognition is invading our lives. It’s built into our phones, our game consoles and our smartwatches. It’s even automating our homes - you can get an Amazon Echo Dot — a magic box that allows you to order pizza, get a weather report or even buy trash bags — just by speaking out loud. As this information suggests, machine learning is big. Nearly any organization that wants to take advantage of its data to gain insights, improve relationships with customers, increase sales, or be competitive is using machine learning or will have to do so in the near future. These organisations will need AI-trained professionals to fill rewarding positions, such as Machine Learning Engineer, Big Data & AI Architect, Software Developer - Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Scientist, Artificial Intelligence Engineer, Research Engineer - Artificial Intelligence, Data and AI Consultant, Robotics Professional and more. Aspirants who are already working as engineers, software and IT professionals, data professionals and wish to upskill to machine learning, can get enrolled into upGrad’s PG Diploma in Machine Learning and AI certified by IIIT Bangalore.

2019-11-28,"Indore: AI to help district farmers select right crop, cut cost, reap profits",Sagar Choukse,"Profile of the farmland, which was yet to be named and expected to be ready in a month, will also be available as a mobile application INDORE : To reduce cost of farming and better management of agriculture sector, the district administration is working on an artificial intelligence decision support system (AIDSS) to prepare a database of 1.23 lakh farmland in the district. The database will help decide appropriate crop for individual farmers based on quality of soil, weather condition, availability of water and other resources. Collector Lokesh Kumar Jatav said the administration was preparing ‘biodata’ of all 1.23 lakh farmland in Indore that includes name of farmer, raqba (total area), village, soil profile, monsoon history of last three years, availability of water for irrigation, average record of production and availability of resources like agriculture tools with the farmers to suggest them the right crop. “Every farmland’s soil profile is unique but at present, the agriculture department suggests sowing of crops based on average production of the area,” said the collector. The administration has decided to create an individual profile of each farmland based on its soil health and other parameters, which will help suggest the right crop to farmer to reap maximum benefits and will also help in better use of available resources. Profile of the farmland, which was yet to be named and expected to be ready in a month, will also be available as a mobile application. “We are planning to provide farmers a log-in ID and password to access the profile using the mobile application. It will update them about real characteristics of their farmland, availability of urea, fertilizers, seeds and other substances in market and other information related to the farming,” deputy director agriculture department Vijay Chourasia told TOI. He said that with the help of Metrological department, the administration will inform farmers about prediction of monsoon and according steps to save their crops from being damage, timing of sowing, irrigation, harvesting, nearby Mandis to sale the crops and the rates.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/ai-to-help-district-farmers-select-right-crop-cut-cost-reap-profits/articleshow/72267284.cms

2019-11-25,Traffic cops seek nod for AI cameras for better management,TNN,"JAIPUR: The city traffic police have sought a nod for artificial intelligence (AI)-powered cameras that can capture in one shot over 11 offences including driving without helmet, wrong-side driving, high-beam violation etc. DCP (Traffic) Rahul Prakash told TOI that some of the most high-tech CCTVs currently operational in the city, are limited to automatic speed detection and red-light violation readings. But new high-range CCTVs with AI software can detect a series of violations without any human intervention. “The new technology will allow round-the-clock monitoring of vehicles in the city. The software can automatically detect traffic offenders including lane driving, traffic light, no parking, number plate, high beam violations. We would no longer need to have a cop sit on the screen and monitor each vehicle,” he said. The proposal stated that the number of vehicles on the city streets has increased manifold in the city but number of traffic cops remains limited. Therefore, advanced technology is requisite to control traffic system in Jaipur. According to traffic police, a comprehensive survey of Jaipur’s major streets revealed that every day 2,000 vehicles violate important traffic norms like speeding. Similarly, over the last decade, the registration figures of high-acceleration and top-speed cars have increased by over 60 per cent. The proposal was submitted under Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) which is part of the smart city project. The ITMS projects include signal synchronization, signal fault monitoring system, parking management system at different places in Jaipur. The total ITMS cost is estimated to be Rs 100 crore, but given the exuberant cost of the project, the Jaipur police have sought funding from transport department, JDA, and Rajasthan police’s modernization fund to kick off the project. “We cannot deploy cops at every location, therefore, it is important that new technology is introduced for better monitoring,” said an official.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/traffic-cops-seek-nod-for-ai-cameras-for-better-mgmt/articleshow/72214325.cms
2019-11-24,"Now, an AI tool to create archive-based news reports",Binu Karunakaran,"<p><br>Shine George, an associate professor with the department of computer applications who developed the system, has now been awarded a doctorate by Cochin university of science and technology (Cusat) for his research</p> KOCHI: In a promising research initiative that could, in future, free journalists from doing mundane stuff like creation of background stories, a researcher has developed an artificial intelligence-based software that can generate news reports based on archives. Shine George, an associate professor with the department of computer applications who developed the system, has now been awarded a doctorate by Cochin university of science and technology (Cusat) for his research. A former journalist, George first thought of using AI tools while working as a reporter in a television channel to overcome the practical difficulties he faced while putting up background information for developing stories. The AI tool he developed utilizes neural network and deep learning tech. It will prepare news stories from archives, based on keywords. The system is resource intensive and runs on advanced cloud computing power from Amazon Web Services, said George, who began researching the topic in 2011. The AI tool was developed in 2018 after seven years of research, he said. “An issue I faced during research was that it required vast amount of computing power. I used Amazon Web Service, but it cost around seven dollars an hour,” said George, who had to spent around Rs three to four lakh from his own pocket for the research. He also made use of a demo version of Open Calais, a system for intelligent tagging that utilizes natural language processing, text analytics and data-mining technologies to derive meaning from vast amounts of unstructured content. “The system I developed is based on a continuous process called deep learning that improves with each pass in discerning the best output. The system I have developed would be useful in analytical and background stories,” said George, who completed research under the guidance of Dr Jagathiraj V P and K V Pramod of Cusat. Shine feels that the system could generate stories in unusual angles that human writers often overlook. Research and development in this domain is fast accelerating and George is confident of the current weaknesses of such systems will also rectified in the near future. As part of this project, George studied three media houses in-depth, including BBC, Cricinfo and YouTube. Promising results were obtained from all three. “Television channels, newspapers and online media, as well as entities like museum and historical archives can benefit from this. Wherever information and updates are important, this project can add immense value,” he said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/now-an-ai-tool-to-create-archive-based-news-reports/articleshow/72191248.cms
2019-11-23,Bot As Therapist: How Far Can AI Go?,Aditi Ray&Anam Ajmal,"Chatbots, downloadable as apps , have to many become the most accessible therapists due to the acute shortage of professionals and the universality of the smartphone. But is this the right approach to a mental health problem? Back in 2017, Aparna was struggling professionally and personally. The 32-year-old HR professional based in Gurgaon could barely meet work targets and felt guilty for not being able to spend more time with her three-and-a-half-year-old daughter. Aparna was diagnosed with severe anxiety. It wasn’t, however, a visit to a therapist but an Android application, IWill, that helped her understand the problem. The app, which Aparna discovered while looking for help online, asked her a set of questions, like age range, areas of concern, daily activities, sleeping patterns and food habits. After a 3-minute interaction, it paired her with a mental health professional. It was exactly the help she needed. Of the 1.3 billion people in India, an estimated 56 million are suffering from depression and another 38 million from anxiety. Although there is no official data on the number of mental healthcare practitioners, according to a recent report by the World Health Organisation, there are only around 5,000 psychiatrists and fewer than 2,000 clinical psychologists in India, making it difficult for large sections of our population to approach experts. But as more and more Indians move online, there has been a steady rise in the number of mobile applications and websites on mental health. According to a Kantar report released earlier this year, India’s internet user base is likely to reach 627 million by the end of 2019. The most accessible therapist, to many of them, would be a friendly app store bot , as easily downloadable as a Swiggy or an Amazon app. But sharing anxieties and worries with bots also raises an important question: who is listening to these? Faceless therapists IWill, currently available only on Android, was developed by Gurgaon-based ePsyclinic. The founder, Shipra Dawar, once lived with depression and founded the company to bridge the gap between patients and mental healthcare professionals. “Depression or a feeling of anxiety can hit you anytime. Even if it is 1am, you can chat on the app,” says Dawar. The app, according to IWill, has had nearly 50,000 downloads so far and 10% of users opted for counselling services after the initial stage of diagnosis for a fee. The company employs 35 psychologists and has 15 freelancers. IWill’s reliance on automation is confined to the detection stage. But some apps like Wysa use artificial intelligence to train chatbots as virtual mental fitness coaches. The Bengaluru-based company was founded by a couple — Jo Aggarwal and Ramakant Vempati — in 2015. Its founding premise was to reach out to people before they arrive at the crisis stage, Jo explains. The app, which claims to have a user base of 2.5 lakh in India, works on the principles of cognitive behaviour therapy that aims to change the way a person thinks or behaves by tracking mood and monitoring eating and sleeping habits to help break negative patterns. WoeBot, developed by clinical research psychologist Alison Darcy from Stanford, works similarly. It checks in on users every day and asks them to maintain a ‘gratitude journal’ that encourages them to keep updating a list of things they are thankful for. When it senses a problem, the app can tell an uplifting story too. Preeti (26), a teacher in Kolkata, found initial conversations with the Wysa chatbot helped overcome apprehensions. “I could easily catalogue my thoughts and emotions,” she says. The user reviews are positive, pointing out several ways in which the app helped. “Don’t have the family support I need for my moodiness and tantrums,” wrote one user on iOS. Coaching the coach Explaining how chatbots can help users create goals and track progress, Bengaluru-based psychologist Mahesh Natarajan says, “The ability of these apps to guide and hold a person’s chat history, assessment history, therapy worksheets and records can be very helpful for specific analysis and solution-oriented therapies, and even to work through cognitive therapies. Increasingly, chatbots will play a bigger role as wellness coach.” Wysa employs 25 people, including eight mental health professionals who serve as coaches. “We have a database of over 80 million conversations to learn from. The conversations are arranged according to topics like relationship problems, depression, anxiety and stress. The AI can recognise certain words to figure out which topic it should talk about. We test all our conversations with the internal team before launching them in the market,” says Jo. Bengaluru-based Aishwarya Kamat (24), who works as content writer for a chatbot, has to make sure interactions don’t feel mechanical. “The first job is to determine a topic a user wants to speak about. It could, for example, be about relationship problems. Once we identify the topic, our clinical experts put together a script for the bot,” says Kamat. Asked if she wondered who she was talking to when she first reached out to the IWill bot, Aparna says, “At that point, it didn’t matter as I just wanted to talk my heart out. It felt safe because not many personal questions were asked.” Privacy & dangers However, as conversations around mental health progress online, the interplay between data and security does get a lot more complex and personal information troves, collected in servers and clouds and prone to misuse, are a concern worldwide. “There is a lack of transparency in the marketing and promotional material for chatbots that do not reveal what happens to the sensitive information being stored. Is this being used to train the algorithm for future users, fine-tune the technology, or for monitoring purposes?” asks behavioural scientist and AI expert Pragya Aggarwal. She also questions the notion that bots are ‘unbiased’. “There is a perception that technology is neutral and unbiased, and people are more likely to trust a chatbot than a human being. But a chatbot will inherit the prejudices of its makers. Bias in AI is not being given adequate attention, especially when such tools are being deployed in a sensitive domain,” Aggarwal adds. Researchers argue it’s easier for AI to unlearn biases when compared to humans but are ambivalent about the bigger question: should anyone with a mental health problem be talking to a bot? “There is definitely potential for apps to be harmful, based on the way the chatbot responds,” says Aditya Vidyam, a research assistant at Harvard University whose work focuses on digital psychiatry. Speaking to a chatbot, he adds, can be a hit or a miss, and individuals with depression would not want to hear a computer say, ‘I know how you feel’ or ‘I have felt that way before too’. Currently, there isn’t enough research to gauge the impact these virtual therapists have on users. But there is also no evidence that suggests patients should be deterred from interacting with a bot as long as there is human intervention in the process. Nimesh Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences, says technology can bridge the huge gap between need for therapists and availability. “It would be stupid to not encourage the application of AI in the mental health sphere. But one should maintain caution. Regulations around it should be more stringent,” says Desai, who is also CEO of State Mental Health Authority, Delhi. “AI shouldn’t be a standalone activity. The expertise of AI should be combined with in-person guidance.” IIT Delhi associate professor Arpan Kar says the diagnosis of any mental disorder through chatbots is not unethical but prescribing a treatment or medication through AI is. “Chatbots in the wellness sector will always have a higher outreach. If taught properly, they will have higher accuracy and the quality of assessment will also be top notch. But the larger worry is if the model is flawed, who should be held accountable? The user, the data (context), which trained it, the developer or the company that commercialised it?” asks the professor.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/bot-as-therapist-how-far-can-ai-go/articleshow/72090759.cms
2019-11-20,"‘Sebi using AI, ML for social media surveillance’",TNN,"MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi is using machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence, among other tech, for surveillance through social media analytics and IT security. The regulator informed this on Tuesday, quoting its chairman Ajay Tyagi from his speech at an event that was organised in Singapore on Saturday. He also said that Sebi plans to spend Rs 500 crore in the next five years on upgrading and building new IT capabilities. The Sebi chairman was speaking at the South Asian Diaspora Convention at the National University of Singapore. “New technologies like distributed ledger technology (DLT), robotic process automation (RPA), and natural language processing in various fields of securities markets like clearing & settlement, risk management, surveillance, compliance automation, etc, are increasingly being considered and tested globally,” he said. Tyagi said that Sebi’s approach has always been to encourage and improve capacity building and innovation and at the same time to be aware of the possible risks associated with such capacity building and managing them. “Sebi does not prescribe the type of technology to be deployed by intermediaries for carrying out their functions/providing their services, and its regulations are technology agnostic,” he said. However, it ensures that risk containment measures of new technologies adopt by the regulated entities should comply with IOSCO’s principles pertaining to those areas. Detailing the use of technology in Sebi’s operations, Tyagi said that the regulator uses and regularly updates technology and plans to spend Rs 500 crore on IT projects in the next five years. “Sebi plans to have its own private cloud to have a common IT infrastructure for all of Sebi’s IT infra needs, which is readily scalable as well as has systems with open standards compatible with any technology.” It’s also putting in place a Network Operations Centre (NOC) for continuous monitoring of the smooth functioning of the Sebi IT network and Securities Operations Centre (SOC) to detect and mitigate cyberattacks on Sebi’s IT infrastructure in efficient and effective way. “Sebi has also planned a data lake project to augment analytical capability with advance analytical tools (like) AI/ML, deep learning, big data analytics, pattern recognition, processing of structured and unstructured data, text mining, natural language processing, etc,” he said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-using-ai-ml-for-social-media-surveillance/articleshow/72133796.cms
2019-11-13,AI cannot replace the human connect needed in hospitality industry,Priyanka Srivastava,"Ulrika Bjorklund on why AI is not a threat to the jobs but a tool to add ease to the system Artificial intelligence , as we know, is making a foray in most sectors. Some elements of AI has been included in the hospitality industry as a result of which the students are being trained to learn new courses designed as per the changing requirements of the industry. There is a certain amount of uncertainty and apprehension over jobs being eaten away by AI. Ulrika Bjorklund, academic director, Hotel Institute Montreux , Switzerland , does not consider AI as a threat to the jobs in hospitality. ""AI has definitely replaced humans, but the human connection is crucial in the hospitality industry. The ' human touch ', care and empathy that is required within our industry cannot be replaced entirely by AI,"" says Ulrika while chatting with Education Times . AI should be seen as an instrument complementing our jobs since it brings an element of ease, she says. ""We have been able to use AI to bring an element of fun, excitement and convenience for the guests."" ""Hospitality is not restricted to hotels. There are several students who studied Hospitality Management, now work with Tesla, or in the watch industry, banks and more. This is because a bit of hospitality is in every sector,"" Ulrika says. As the academic director, she aims to make the new-age curriculum more relevant to the changing times and technology. ""Hospitality education now has greater focus on Luxury Management. In our luxury brand management specialisation, we emphasise on artificial intelligence, along with sustainability and heritage management,"" adds Ulrika. The brands, says Ulrika, are focussing more towards sustainability and safeguarding the heritage. The fashion industry, for instance, is now using more sustainable products. ""We are including the industry partners to formulate the curriculum. We need to bring those topics to the classrooms that are in sync with the industry demands,"" she adds, underlining how the learning is not complete in the classroom where one is dependent on the books. ""When the students go out to work in the industry, the learning takes a new turn."" As the tourism sector expands across the globe, the hotels are undergoing changes too. ""Travellers now have a much broader choice.

2019-11-09,AI can predict where lightning will strike 30min in advance,PTI,"LONDON: Scientists on Friday said they have developed a simple and inexpensive artificial intelligence (AI) system that can predict when lightning will strike any place within a 30-kilometre radius, up to 30 minutes in advance. Lightning — one of the most unpredictable phenomena in nature — regularly kills people and animals and sets fire to homes and forests. It keeps aircraft grounded and damages power lines. However, little is known about what triggers lightning, and there is no simple technology for predicting when and where lightning will strike, noted the researchers from Ecole polytechnique federale de Lausanne in Switzerland . The new system, described in the journal Climate and Atmospheric Science, uses a combination of standard meteorological data and artificial intelligence. “Current systems are slow and complex, and they require expensive external data acquired by radar or satellite,” said Amirhossein Mostajabi, the PhD student who developed the technique. “Our method uses data that can be obtained from any weather station. That means we can cover remote regions that are out of radar and satellite range and where communication networks are unavailable.” Since the data can be acquired easily and in real time, predictions can be made quickly — and alerts can be issued even before a storm has formed, the researchers said. The new method uses a machinelearning algorithm that has been trained to recognise conditions that lead to lightning. The researchers used data collected over a ten-year period from 12 Swiss weather stations. The results revealed that “the machine learning model was able to warn with a reasonable accuracy of future lightning activity up to 30 minutes in advance and in an area of 30km around the observation point”, the researchers wrote in the journal. Four parameters were taken into account: atmospheric pressure, air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed. The researchers correlated the parameters with recordings from lightning detection and location systems. Using that method, the algorithm was able to learn the conditions under which lightning occurs. Once trained, the system made predictions that proved correct almost 80% of the time, the researchers said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/ai-can-predict-where-lightning-will-strike-30min-in-advance/articleshow/71978418.cms
2019-11-04,"‘Bridgital can help us create jobs, improve services, be AI-ready’",Reeba Zachariah,"Chandrasekaran and Roopa Purushothaman (RP), chief economist at the Tata Group , recently co-authored Bridgital Nation , which looks closely at using technology to create jobs and widen access to education, healthcare and other services. TOI spoke to them about their attempt to reimagine automation. Excerpts: Your book Bridgital India presents a plan to create 30 million jobs, raise wages by 10-20% and improve access to basic services to nearly 200 million Indians — all of this by 2025. Who will do this? It requires the efforts of everybody — government, business, regulators. We have to work together. Take passport issuances. In the past, government handled the entire work. Now, officials come in at the last stage, most of the work is done by non-government people. A change in mindset, labour law reforms, and upskilling are required to implement Bridgital. What role will the Tata Group play in implementing this? I hope we will attempt to do some large projects. Whether in the social sector (nonprofit) or business, I don’t know. It doesn’t matter how we do it. This (Bridgital) addresses fundamental questions of access to services and creation of jobs. How do you solve lack of health services in rural areas? A guy armed with a medicine degree will prefer to open a small clinic in south Mumbai rather than work in a primary healthcare centre in a rural area where there is no incentive, infrastructure, or quality of life. But, primary healthcare services problems can be fixed to a large extent through digital. Doctors and nurses do many things. Some things can be done by people at the next level if they are upskilled. Health records can be digitised… the ones who require follow-up care can be addressed by the non-doctors. Companies approach technology with an aim to cut costs and enhance profits. There are concerns that increased dependency on artificial intelligence (AI) and automation would impact jobs... There is no going away from the fact that AI will impact everybody’s lives. Technology is good at certain things. Humans are good at certain things. The fear of AI taking away jobs is completely unfounded. Every time a technology disruption happens, it creates new possibilities. It happened at the time of steam engines... it will now happen in the time of AI… people have to be prepared. I studied AI and robotics in college in 1985. Robotics is all about mechatronics. Why are we calling software robots? Because the brain power of robots has increased with processing power and cloud… the beauty is that machines will never know the power of humans but humans will always know the power of machines. Humans can deliberately control the way machine power is used. RP: Automation will happen in different ways in different sectors in different times. In financial services, it will be quicker. But in healthcare it will take time. We should be smart enough to get people upskilled and move them across sectors. But people worry that with so much data in the hands of companies, there will be more breaches... Data being available is not bad. The negative thing is data could be misused at the business level, at government level. So, data privacy laws should be clearly articulated and, more importantly, enforced. While tariffs and immigration were issues for the physical world, data privacy and data localisation will be issues for the digital world. How much does digital comprise of TCS’ revenue? It’s 48%, though it doesn’t make sense any more to give that number because everything is integrated. It was important to show the market that we are playing in this new area but now this is becoming the core. And digital in other Tata companies? Every business will become digital.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bridgital-can-help-us-create-jobs-improve-services-be-ai-ready/articleshow/71884093.cms
2019-10-28,IIT-Madras develops algorithms for AI,Aditi R,"CHENNAI: Researchers at Indian Institute of Technology - Madras have developed algorithms that enable novel applications for artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning to solve engineering problems. The Researchers are going to establish a startup to deploy their AI software called ‘AISoft’ to develop solutions to engineering problems in varied fields such as in thermal management, semiconductors, automobile, aerospace and electronic cooling applications. AI, machine learning and deep learning are now being used for over a decade but traditionally only in areas such as signal processing, speech recognition, image reconstruction and prediction. Very limited attempts have been made globally in using these algorithms in solving engineering problems such as thermal management, electronic cooling industries, automobile problems like fluid dynamics prediction over a bonnet or inside the engine, aerospace industries like aerodynamics and fluid dynamics problems across an aero-foil or turbine engine. A team of researchers led by Dr Vishal Nandigana, assistant professor, Fluid Systems Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT-Madras , developed the AI and deep learning algorithms. This idea is new and is only has now being looked by a few research groups across the world. Most of these research groups use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or C-GAN (conditional generative adversarial network) to solve engineering problems. Highlighting the unique aspects of these algorithms, Nandigana said, “We tested AIsoft and used it to solve such thermal management problems. We found it to be nearly million-fold faster compared to existing solutions currently used in the field. Our AI works on any generalised rectilinear and curvilinear input geometry. Our research saves the computational time, which is the bottleneck to solve most engineering problems.” The researchers utiliSed a data-driven AI and a deep learning model to arrive at solutions for engineering problems after training the AI with data sets. These prior data sets can be from existing big data in the relevant engineering industry where there are lots of experimental data available. Also, if data is not available for training the AI, it can be generated using commercially-available CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software on small independent pieces of the full-blown problem. Nandigana said, “Our AI stands out in this aspect from commercially available software.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/iit-madras-develops-algorithms-for-ai/articleshow/71791115.cms
2019-10-23,IIT-H develops low power chip for AI-enabled devices,Preeti Biswas,"HYDERABAD: With the advent of artificial intelligence devices in day to day life, researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H) have developed low power chips that can perform high level computation with constraint power consumption. Currently, many modern systems using speech and face recognition transmits large computational data which requires a lot of power. To cater the growing demand in processing and storing big data arising, the need for high performance computing data centers is rapidly growing. Using nanomagnets, the IIT-H have developed Magnetic quantum-dot cellular automata based low power chip that can perform computation on the AI devices with limited power supply. The chip is energy efficient and consumes ultra-low power. ""In the present silicon system, the data is first transmitted to the cloud for processing and then the final outcome is delivered on the device. Such heavy computation is power-hungry. We envisioned of developing a chip which does the computation by itself in limited power resources,"" said Santhosh Sivasubramani, research scholar, Advanced Embedded Systems and IC Design Laboratory, department of electrical engineering , IIT-H. The researchers have used AI computing on edge with approximate nanomagnetic logic. ""Approximate nanomagnetic computing means that the application can compromise on accuracy a little bit but with less power consumption. Even if the final results are not 100 per cent, the computing has to be power efficient,"" added Sivasubramani. The low power chip developed by IIT-H researchers can be used in autonomous driving vehicles, drones used in agricultural fields, sensory data, remote surveillance, human monitoring, ECG where data generation is very high. ""Our work targets devices, where there is a significant investment in the research towards making it low power without compromising on accuracy too much. Performing AI computing on edge with approximate nanomagnetic logic deployed on the magnetic ICs is an attempt towards the futuristic computations,"" said Amit Acharyya, associate professor, department of electrical engineering, IIT-H. The research has been published in peer-reviewed journal by Nanotechnology (Prestigious journal of Institute of Physics).",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//education/news/iit-h-develops-low-power-chip-for-ai-enabled-devices/articleshow/71715045.cms
2019-10-22,"Artificial Intelligence might render doctors defunct, fears Infosys co-founder",TNN,"MYSURU: An unsettling undercurrent of the disturbing prescience that informs several Hollywood science-fiction films ran through Infosys co-founder K Dinesh’s inaugural address at a capacity building workshop ‘University as a Catalyst for Change’ at the Rani Bahadhur Auditorium at the University of Mysore on Monday. Expressing fears of those engaged in the medical profession being rendered obsolete by robots, Dinesh said, “In the next ten years, there may be no hospitals. It might sound farfetched but the startling pace of advancements in automation is making the possibility of robots replacing physicians. What might, on the surface, seem like a Hollywood script, could become our reality. Soon, the superspeciality hospitals where the most complex surgeries are performed could become the only fixture of the healthcare sector as we know it today.” Pointing out that knowledge was an infinite arena, Dinesh called on students not to lose faith in their abilities. “Your approach to academics must be comprehensive. You must not confine your learning to one domain since an inter-disciplinary pursuit of education is the best way to expand one’s knowledge,” said the Infosys co-founder, exhorting the lodestars of academia to be the collective bellwether in the domain of governance by infusing it with accountability. ‘Meeting Neil Armstrong was a special moment’ Recalling the years he spent in Mysuru as a child, Dinesh said that the date, July 21, 1969 was etched indelibly in his brain. “When we read about Neil Armstrong having walked on the moon, there were whispers that the information was not authentic. But my father, a high-school science teacher assured me that a man had indeed landed on the moon. Many years later, I met Neil Armstrong, the first man to land on the moon, and this was one of those unforgettable and special occasions in my life,” said Dinesh. His ascent from humble origins to the summit of the information technology (IT) industry, Dinesh attributed to his undying belief in his abilities. “I studied in Kannada medium schools in Sagara in Shivamogga,, Arasikere in Hassan and Magadi in Bengaluru. I then enrolled at the science college in Bengaluru. I remained convinced in my abilities, and that has brought me where I am today,” he said. Executive director for the Karnataka State Higher Education Council SA Kori pointed to the increasing stringency in the rules of the Union ministry of human resource development for launching new programmes. “New programmes are being permitted only after the varsities submit a report on the programme outcome. This is a sign for both varsities, and teachers to seriously contemplate revision of their roles. Traditional teachers must look at themselves more as facilitators,” said Kori. Former UoM and Karnataka State Open University vice-chancellor Prof KS Rangappa, UoM VC Prof G Hemantha Kumar and many other prominent academicians from across the state were in attendance at the inaugural event.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/artificial-intelligence-might-render-doctors-defunct-fears-infosys-co-founder/articleshow/71694778.cms
2019-10-21,"Stop demonising tech, says PM Narendra Modi while backing AI",TNN,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday cautioned against the demonisation of technology, saying the effort should be to harness its potential to transform people’s lives. Disputing the dire narrative about threat of job losses because of the growing application of Artificial Intelligence, Modi said, “There has been a trend to demonise technology. In the context of India, it has been depicted as a threat to our demographic dividend. “Technology unites, it does not divide. It acts as a bridge between aspiration and achievement, demand and delivery and between government and governance. It is a talent and force multiplier. The need is to build bridges between Artificial Intelligence and human intentions.” The Prime Minister was speaking at the launch of ‘Bridgital Nation’, written by Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran and Roopa Purushothaman, chief economist and head of policy advocacy at the Tata Group . She was earlier part of the Goldman Sachs team that coined the term ‘ BRIC ’ to describe the potential that Brazil, Russia , India and China held. Modi gave the first copy of the book to Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of Tata Sons. He praised the book and said it represented “positivity, creativity, and constructive mindset” that was crucial for the fast growing aspirational India. Modi also said the book, with its positive outlook, would promote optimism among people, including among “professional pessimists”. The PM also said that technology had helped foster a new system eco-system of startups which now stretched to Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, and cited the example of India Post Payment Bank to emphasise that the challenges posed by technology could be converted into opportunities.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/stop-demonising-tech-says-pm-narendra-modi-while-backing-ai/articleshow/71679298.cms
2019-10-06,Only 10 pc of Indian CEOs confident about reliability of AI applications: PwC,PTI,"New Delhi, Oct 6 () Only 10 per cent of Indian CEOs are confident about the reliability of their artificial intelligence (AI) applications, according to PwC India. Even as AI has the potential to solve complex problems effectively at scale, badly designed applications can cause more harm than good, PwC India said in its report based on a comprehensive study conducted with over 1,000 CXOs and business decision makers from India and other regions, between May and September 2019. The intent of the study was to understand the outlook towards AI in India. Findings of the report strongly indicate the need to invest in building AI systems that are responsible, understandable and ethical, ensuring customer trust. AI can be defined as a collection of technologies which are capable of sensing, thinking and acting like rational human beings. The respondents spanned across industries such as technology, media and telecom, financial services, professional services, health, industrial products, consumer markets, government, and utilities, said PwC India. ""An overwhelming majority of decision makers globally as well as from India confessed that they may not have robust tools or processes for ensuring reliability of their AI solutions. ""Interestingly, only 10 per cent of Indian respondents were confident about the reliability of their AI applications,"" it said. Deepankar Sanwalka, Leader- Advisory at PwC India, said that it is encouraging to see Indian organisations adopt or willing to adopt AI significantly in the coming few years. However, to scale AI initiatives, organisations will have to ensure these solutions are ethically sound, compliant with all regulations, with a robust governance framework, he said. The report further said ""it is heartening"" to note that India (62 per cent) is not very far behind global (65 per cent) in terms of implementation of AI. However, the worrying part is that Indian respondents (53 per cent) significantly outnumber their global counterparts (36 per cent) in admitting that they have no formal approach to identify AI risks, it said. Sudipta Ghosh, Leader- Data and Analytics, PwC India added that merely adopting AI will not yield desired results. AI must be supported by strong performance pillars addressing bias and fairness, interpretability and explainability, robustness and security, he said. ""Else, the enthusiasm to implement AI projects is very likely to run into headwinds. Benefits of AI may be realised when an appropriate governance framework and dimensions are in place, and humans and machines can collaborate effectively,"" Ghosh said. The study, PwC India said reiterates the need for a comprehensive Responsible AI (RAI) framework and toolkit for its widespread adoption. It also highlights how AI's potential can be unlocked as well as maximised if a structured approach is taken towards addressing the associated risks.

2019-10-05,Delhi: IIT alumna’s AI-enabled platform to help fight stubble burning menace,Ritam Halder,"NEW DELHI: Soon, an artificial intelligence-enabled platform will be able to better monitor farm fires and the emission caused by them. It will also predict the size of the burnt area and the amount of crop waste burnt. A start-up co-founded by an IIT-BHU alumna is developing it. Zuri, the AI-enabled platform built by Gurugram-based Blue Sky Analytics, which has recently been awarded the Copernicus Masters Social Entrepreneurship Challenge hosted by the European Space Agency, is currently under construction. “It will be launched in the beta version in the current quarter, and will be fully available from early 2020. We will then provide a marketplace for crop-waste transactions with involvement of alternative users like power plants, furniture manufacturers and packaging producers,” Abhilasha Purwar told TOI. Track the pollution level in your city According to the start-up, improved monitoring can cut the pollution peak by half, directly benefiting over 300 million people and reducing India’s disease burden. “Utilisation of the crop waste calorific value in energy systems can help increase the clean electricity production. The supply chain modelling features will enable and catalyse alternative use of crop residue into profitable and sustainable sectors of engineered wood, sustainable packaging, and so on,” said the co-founder. “We are analysing terabytes of complex satellite data to do air quality and pollution emission monitoring. Zuri will ensure data analysis and dissemination via a single web dashboard, with details, parameters and insights like fire counts, intensity, emissions, expected crop waste and calorific value, burning predictions and high-risk zones among others. It will integrate this data with broader road network, power plant location, and other supply chain parameters to enable conversion of stubble from crop waste to useful industrial raw material,” Purwar added. Farm fires are a major source of air pollution in North India. This open biomass burning contributes to PM2.5 in Delhi by 20-25%, says the latest TERI report. Most farmers growing rice and wheat in North India prepare their fields for the wheat crop in October-November by burning the stubbles left after the rice harvest. Governments, both the Centre and the state, have come up with several incentives and penalties to combat the farm fire menace, which adds to the pollution load of Delhi air. They have even allocated over Rs 1,000 crore to deal with the problem. But the stubble burning continues unabated at several places. The start-up has another platform BreeZo which uses satellite data for air quality monitoring and expands on the 170-odd location data provided by the government stations. “Cities like Kanpur, Jhansi and Ranchi have no stations, and even metropolitan cities like Mumbai and Kolkata have only a couple of stations. What you can’t monitor, you can’t solve,” said the IIT alumna. “This app is available on Play Store and has more than 4,500 users at present. It provides simple details about air quality to a person, and also helps people in minimising their personal direct exposure by predictions and suggestions on changes in lifestyle.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/iit-alumnas-ai-enabled-platform-to-help-fight-stubble-burning-menace/articleshow/71448065.cms

2019-09-21,Army wants AI in big way to boost combat lethality,Rajat Pandit,"NEW DELHI: The Army now wants to harness the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to bolster its combat lethality and survivability, even as the 13-lakh force is testing its new integrated battle groups (IBGs) geared towards mobilising fast and striking hard across the borders. With China taking huge strides in the ongoing global race to develop AI-powered weapon and surveillance systems for futuristic wars, with a special focus on developing lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS), India obviously does not want to miss the bus. “China is employing AI (basically simulation of human intelligence processes by computers) in the defence arena in a big way. It has zoomed ahead. But we can catch up because we have the required IT (information technology) brains in India. Our aim is to examine how AI can help us become more lethal and effective in our war-fighting in a flexible and dynamic battlefield,” said South Western Command (SWC) chief Lt-General Alok Kler, speaking to TOI on Friday. The government has also formulated a road map to make India “a significant power” in the use of AI in the military domain, with defence minister Rajnath Singh announcing this week that “25 defence-specific AI products” will be developed by 2024. But that is in the future. With the use of AI for military applications being largely restricted to policy formulations and task forces in the country till now, the Army wants its field formations to get well acquainted with the “disruptive technologies” in the arena. With the new self-contained IBGs largely centred around T-90S main-battle tanks, along with a mix of infantry, artillery, air defence, signals and engineers, the SWC will be holding a two-day brain-storming session with top military officers, scientists and IT experts on “AI in mechanised (tanks and infantry combat vehicles) warfare” at Hissar next week. The Army is trying to significantly enhance the “shock and awe’’ capabilities of its mechanized forces, which includes 63 armoured corps regiments and over 35 mechanized infantry battalions, with both strategic mobility and enhanced firepower required for rapid offensive thrusts into enemy territory. “Robotic warfare will take a long time as far as the subcontinent is concerned,” said Lt-Gen Kler, adding that the focus for now is on using AI to enable faster and “assisted” decision-making, shortening the sensor-to-shooter loop with swift target identification and recognition, “predictive maintenance” of the mechanised forces and the like. “It’s not possible for human brains, even if many are clubbed together, to collate and synthesize feeds and inputs from multiple sources like radars, drones and satellites in real time. The aim is to reach the right decision at the right time with the help of AI. This technological edge over the adversary can give huge payoffs,” said Lt-Gen Kler.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-wants-ai-in-big-way-to-boost-combat-lethality/articleshow/71227466.cms

The book is printed both in English and Hindi. “The workshop held on campus included two basic technical talks in the forenoon and a hands-on session in the afternoon in the IIT Goa computing center,” said Sinha. “The workshop was held in collaboration with ACM Special Interest Group on Artificial Intelligence under the AI activities fund, and was one of the few proposals accepted worldwide by ACM or Association for Computing Machinery. ACM is one of the largest professional organisations in the world in the area of computer science and engineering.” The students were exposed to the basic concepts of artificial intelligence and learned about automatically classifying images of different flowers into different groups.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/iit-goa-trains-school-students-from-ponda-in-ai/articleshow/71088102.cms
2019-09-11,CBSE AI curriculum to be prepared by IBM,TNN,"BENGALURU: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had earlier announced the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as an elective for students in classes 9 to 12. The curriculum for the subject is now being developed from scratch by a team from IBM India along with members of its global team and other subject experts. To begin with, IBM will conduct a pilot project in 1,000 schools in Bengaluru, Delhi, Kolkata, Bhubaneswar, Hyderabad and Chennai, before finalising the curriculum and embedding it in the CBSE curriculum from the next academic year. The pilot is being launched in Delhi on Wednesday. The project will start with creating awareness for school principals, followed by a two-and-a half day training of teachers on the foundational skills for the subject. Students will undergo a five-stage training which includes research-informed readings, customised online resources and hands-on projects. The curriculum includes orientation on AI, ideation and innovation workshops on selected areas for AI deployment, and students making a minimum viable prototype. The curriculum also includes Capstone Project, where students will be mentored by IBM experts for advanced prototype development and on-ground implementation of projects to make the foundation stronger. The course will provide a platform for top 40 students from these 1,000 schools, who will be selected for Capstone Project, to showcase at appropriate forums like hackathons or international conferences. Apart from teaching knowledge and skills on AI, the programme has a chapter on ethics including issues of security, privacy and transparency. The programme requires 36 hours of school time for completion. ""Unlike creating a curriculum for professionals, introducing the subject to schoolchildren is different. We have a chance to create a course to give the best effect by using a design-based approach to problem-solving with AI. The programme intends to develop a professional learning community for teachers in partnership with the industry. We will ensure it provides collaborative global project opportunities for students and recognise learning achievements through badging and accreditation,"" Gaurav Sharma, vice-president, India Software labs, IBM, said.

Sample this: While seeking a doctor's appointment, a chat-box asks you to enter your blood diagnosis report. Based on the data, it concludes that you do not require a doctor's appointment. However, as a machine, it will not explain you why it arrived at the conclusion. The model, Artificial Neural Networks, developed by the IIT-H researchers helps the machines explain on why and how it arrived at a conclusion. ""Our model can be used in any machine learning based device that involves prediction. From predicting which movie to watch next to occurrence of earthquake using seismic data, our model will help machines explain its conclusions,"" said Vineeth N. Balasubramanian, associate professor, department of computer science and engineering, IIT-H. Researchers claimed that such an explanation poses a lot of importance in risk-sensitive applications. ""Most machine learning based devices give an output based on a limited data stored in it. Human error, correlations in data can result in errors that go uncorrected. Once a machine learns to explain, it will learn concepts by itself,"" said Balasubramanian. Aim of the research, published in the Proceedings of 36th International Conference on Machine Learning, considered to be one of the highest-rated conferences in the area of AI and ML, was to tackle lack of transparency in deep learning models and to prevent end-users from losing trust over machines. The research was undertaken in collaboration with Honeywell, an American conglomerate into consumer products, engineering services and aerospace systems. The American firm is now in the process of patenting the IIT-H developed model. Meanwhile, the IIT-H researchers will be widening their scope of work to make the model more efficient. ""Currently, the model works on a limited data. Large data may make the model turn slow. We are working on making it more efficient using large data,"" said Balasubramanian.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//education/news/iit-h-ai-model-to-help-machines-explain-learn/articleshow/71058729.cms

2019-09-09,"How artificial intelligence is creating jobs in India, not just stealing them",Sonam Joshi,"NEW DELHI: Five years ago, Hyderabad resident Tulasi Mathi was forced to quit her job as a maths teacher due to health issues and the birth of her two children. But today, the 29-year-old does data labelling and makes up to Rs 15,000 a month. The money isn't much but it's more than she made as a teacher, and enough to pay her kids' school fees and her own expenses. She chanced on data labelling work through a You-Tube video in 2017. Today, she scans videos and marks and labels objects encountered by self-driving cars. Her output is used to train artificial intelligence algorithms powering such cars. All Mathi knows is that it makes her life easier. ""I can work from home and don't have to choose between work and family,"" she says. Experts say there are about a lakh data labelling jobs posted on various portals currently (Pic: Indranil Das) Mathi is one of the faceless workers helping companies in the US and Europe perfect their machine learning models. For instance, if you're trying to get a driverless car to correctly identify a stop sign, you need to feed that algorithm thousands of images correctly labelled as stop signs. Sharmila Gupta of Gurgaon-based AI Touch likens data labelling to training a newborn. ""Any AI model requires labelled data to get trained. This is like teaching a small child multiple times till they understand."" It's a job that only humans can do and since it is quite labour intensive, it is being outsourced to countries with cheap labour like India, Malaysia, the Philippines and Kenya. There is a new AI workforce, says Ajay Shah of HR company TeamLease Services. From an opportunity point of view, there are about a lakh jobs posted on various portals currently. Mary Gray, a researcher and author of the book 'Ghost Work: How to Stop Silicon Valley from Building a New Global Underclass', says there are two main reasons why companies are turning to India for data-labelling and annotation. ""It has a workforce trained in English as a first language and an internet infrastructure created during the first outsourcing boom that relied heavily on India as an offshore labour market,"" says Gray. There is also a growing demand for data-labelling services that are ""localised""- both linguistically and culturally relevant to India - and this work can't be done by workers in the United States. Data labelling workers in Kolkata Playment, a crowd-sourced marketplace that trains annotators from scratch, where Hyderabad's Mathi works, has 25,000 annotators between the age of 18 and 30 years working remotely across India, and its co-founder Siddharth Mall claims that anyone with a laptop and basic English skills can start working. ""Everybody talks about how AI will make people lose their jobs, but there are also new kinds of jobs being created,"" he says. These youngsters earn anywhere between Rs 20,000 and Rs 30,000 a month. It's not a fortune but it's helping many annotators - most of them stay-at-home moms, fresh graduates and even students, such as 21-year-old Shiekha Mahara from Nalgonda, Telangana - get by. Mahara, who recently completed a BTech degree, began looking for online work opportunities to help out with her family's finances. She has earned Rs 1.3 lakh so far while doing occasional projects for Playment over the last year and a half. Unlike Playment which pays people on a contractual basis, iMerit, a data annotation company with offices in India and the US and data labelling centres in Ranchi, Shillong, Vizag and Kolkata, has 2,500 people on their rolls. What they have in common is an overwhelmingly young workforce. At iMerit, the average age of employees is just 24. Jai Natarajan, VP, marketing and strategic business development, says that nearly 80% of their employees come from underprivileged backgrounds, while 50% are women. ""Our employees are positioned for the future because they understand that they have to learn new things, that nothing stays still,"" says Natarajan. iMerit's employees do data labelling for drones in the agriculture sector, medical imagery such as MRI scans , e-commerce , and sports analytics. Mujeeb Kolasseri, a high school dropout from Mannarkkad in Kerala, founded his own data labelling company Infolks in 2015 after learning the work online. Today, the company employs nearly 250 people, nearly half of them from poor families in Kolasseri's village. New employees get trained on image annotation tools for two months. ""Nearly 80% are freshers. With proper training, anyone can work on image annotation without any technical knowledge - you just need to be a quick learner,"" says Kolasseri, who was forced to quit his studies because of his family's financial problems. Data labelling workers in Kerala Jitendra Kumar, 27, would agree. Six months ago, Kumar, who used to drive a four-wheeler for weddings and parties in his hometown Etawah, Uttar Pradesh, found a data labelling job with Gurgaon-based firm AI Touch. ""Now, I get a salary on time, work in an office and can spend some time with my family as well,"" says Kumar. Kumar's colleague Satyam Barthwal, a Chinese interpreter, was hired after the company got work from a Chinese AI company. ""I hadn't even heard of data labelling before I got the call,"" says Barthwal, who sees the job as a way to earn money till he fulfils his dream of becoming a singer. ""The work is easy - we just need to read labels."" But as machine learning evolves, will it make the work of data labelling redundant in the future? ""Since we started in 2013, the precision, nuance and sophistication required has gone up. Sometimes we need domain experts. But even then, you need humans to review, audit and keep track of results. There is going to be a role in AI for humans for a long time,"" adds Natarajan of iMerit.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/how-artificial-intelligence-is-creating-jobs-in-india-not-just-stealing-them/articleshow/71030863.cms

Bescom officials are currently working with the Machine And Language Learning (MALL) Lab at Indian Institute of Science (IISc) to develop a voice bot powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI). The power utility, earlier this year, had published an expression of interest (EoI) to develop the AI-powered voicebot, for which tenders will be floated soon. “IISc has been working for many years on machine learning and natural language processing and we are using their expertise and knowledge to design a voice robot, which will be capable of answering some basic queries of the consumers in Kannada and English. The voice bot, which will be powered by AI, will have the capability to register complaints of consumers and direct them to the right departments for further queries,” said a Bescom official. “The induction of the voice bot into Bescom’s customer care system is expected to fasten the process of logging and redressal of complaints,” added the official. The work of developing and integrating the voice bot with Bescom’s helpline number is expected to be kicked off within six months from when tenders for the project are called. While initially, the robot will only be able to speak Kannada and English, more regional languages will be added later, said Bescom officials. Bescom receives over 10,000 complaints through its helpline number, Whatsapp and other online platforms every single day. Recently, the number of phone lines attached to the Bescom helpline number 1912 was increased from 45 to 60 to deal with burgeoning complaints.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bescom-iisc-to-develop-ai-powered-voice-bot-to-attend-customer-calls/articleshow/71029405.cms

2019-08-29,"AI, algorithms will be decision-makers in boardrooms of tomorrow, say experts",TNN,"The conference held on Wednesday served as a bridge between educational institutions and the industry BENGALURU: Imagine a corporate boardroom meeting where one seat is occupied by a machine doing all the Artificial Intelligence-related thinking, generating complex algorithms and contributing to high-level decision-making. The scene is not out of a sci-fi movie, but a sneak-peek into the future of working in boardrooms. “This is all set to be a reality,” said Sameer Dhanrajani, chief strategy officer of Fractal Analytics, an analytics service provider based in India and the US. He was speaking on the topic, ‘Re-imagining decision-making in the AI era’, at Race360, a technology conference organised here on Wednesday by REVA University and supported by The Times of India. Dhanrajani went on to explain that experience-backed intuition will decrease to 10% by 2027 from 58% in 2017. Algorithmic decisions will go up to almost 50% from just 5% today. The importance of algorithms is such that Dhanrajani predicted a rise of the ‘ algorithm economy’ in the coming years. “Algorithm economy will consist of millions of algorithms; each one representing a piece of software code that solves a business problem or creates a new opportunity,” he pointed out. The conference, with corporate bigwigs and academicians in attendance, was a bridge between educational institutions and the industry, according to speakers at the event. Like Sameer, who spoke on the future of boardrooms, speakers at the event brought into the spotlight several futuristic scenarios, issues and solutions. The conference was inaugurated by REVA University chancellor Dr P Shyama Raju. “Events like these help professionals, corporates and students,” said Raju. ‘Pace of disruption has increased’ Dilip Khandelwal, MD of SAP Labs in India, spoke on ‘Emerging technologies for business transformation’. Explaining in detail about the market disruptors, Khandelwal said technology has always been a disruptor, but this time, the pace of disruption has increased. “What one builds today will be obsolete in 12 to 18 months. Interaction with customers on a day-to-day basis will keep technology up to date,” he said. India growing as global cyber-security hub “We can’t put any company in a particular vertical, each of them is a digital and tech company –– be it health, retail or others. With so much convergence, security is a concern,” said Rama Vedashree the CEO of Data Security Council of India. She added that under such circumstances, India is growing as the global hub of cyber security. With 180 startups and 45 Indian companies securing patents of security techs, Vedashree said there are also 25 to 30 global cyber-security research and development centres in the country. The largest pool of candidates, industry-driven curriculum in colleges and global interest in the cybersecurity field in India has brought the country into the spotlight, Vedashree pointed out. The issues of cybersecurity are also one of the main concerns of several boards, said Satish Janardhanan, MD Cybersecurity, Accenture . “With 54,000-plus security breaches in 2017-18 and 14.6 billion user records stolen since 2013, the approximate cost of cybercrime to the global economy is to the tune of $450 billion annually,” he added.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ai-algorithms-will-be-decision-makers-in-boardrooms-of-tomorrow-say-experts/articleshow/70882456.cms
2019-08-29,IIT-M startups partner to offer affordable AI courses,TNN,"Chennai: Two IIT-Madras startups have entered into a partnership aiming to create “one lakh Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep learning talent” in India by 2020. GUVI, an edtech startup which imparts coding knowledge in regional languages for students in tier-2 and 3 cities is collaborating with One Fourth Labs, a startup offering advanced AI courses at fees starting at Rs 1,000 for a six-month course and Rs 5,000 for working professionals. It is open to every student who is “strong” in high school mathematics and knows a bit of Python programming. While, GUVI will be the tech platform partner and One Fourth Labs will be the content partner for this joint initiative. At a time of skills gap in the field of AI in India, the startups believe affordable courses to help students move from basics to advanced topics is the need of the hour. Launching its courses earlier in February, One Fourth Labs has already helped train over 6,500 students in its first cohort, providing them skills “equivalent to two semesters of AI courses in IITs.” S P Balamurugan, co-founder and CEO, GUVI, said they intend to conduct coding contests periodically for learners with the top performers rewarded through the platform. Periodic assessment will also be conducted in the GUVI platform to issue the certificates upon completion. “In emerging areas such as AI where there is a large demand for courses, a majority of online education providers charge a huge fees often running into lakhs of rupees. With the intention of addressing this, earlier this year we offered a hands-on course on deep learning at a fraction of the typical cost,” Pratyush Kumar, co-founder, One Fourth Labs, and faculty member, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Madras, said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/startups/trend-tracking/iit-m-startups-partner-to-offer-affordable-ai-courses/articleshow/70883457.cms
2019-08-23,AI startup plans IPO at value of over $1 billion,Bloomberg,"The promise of artificial intelligence has yet to translate into big business. Now Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent venture capitalist in China and founder of Sinovation Ventures, says his organisation’s new startup should be able to reach $100 million in revenue next year and go public the year after. AInnovation, established in March 2018, develops AI products for companies in industries such as retail, manufacturing, and finance. Its customers include Mars Inc, Carlsberg A/S, Nestle SA, Foxconn Technology Group, China Everbright Bank Co and Postal Savings Bank of China Co. CEO Hocking Xu, a veteran of International Business Machines Corp and SAP SE, has hired staff that work with traditional companies to figure out how to take advantage of AI in their operations. AInnovation is on track to hit $100 million in revenue within two years of its founding, the fastest pace yet for such a startup, Lee said. “We took the approach of ‘Let’s take some of the best business people and let’s target the industries which need AI the most’,” he said. Lee figures AInnovation will be able to go public in less than two years at a valuation of $1 billion to $2 billion. The firm has raised about $70 million so far from Sinovation, CICC ALPHA and Chengwei Capital. Since the company was funded with yuan, it would most likely list domestically, either on China’s new NASDAQlike Star market, or on the country’s ChiNext. For retail companies, AInnovation sells products including a smart vending machine that opens with facial recognition and software that monitors retail shelves with image recognition. It’s created computer vision technology that detects defects on the production line for manufacturers and underwriting software and natural language processing technology for financial firms. There’s a large market in particular for technology to catch flaws early in the manufacturing process, said Jeffrey Ding, a researcher with Oxford’s Center for the Governance of AI. That effort “aligns with the Chinese government’s priorities to upgrade smart manufacturing capabilities to compete with countries like Germany and Switzerland,” he said. The former president of Google China, Kai-Fu Lee founded Sinovation Ventures in 2009. It manages over $2 billion across seven funds in US and Chinese currencies. It holds shares in more than 300 companies, most of which are in China. Its investments include autonomous driving company Momenta, consumer AI chip firm Horizon Robotics Inc and bitcoin mining and AI chip company Bitmain Technologies Ltd. In AI, “we’re still at a very early stage in the commercialization”, Lee said. “We’re still at the equivalent of early internet portals, back when everybody was using Yahoo and there wasn’t even a Google, Amazon, or Facebook.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/startups/companies/ai-startup-plans-ipo-at-value-of-over-1-billion/articleshow/70797564.cms
2019-08-11,Robots decades away from outsmarting humans: John Sculley,TNN,"HYDERABAD: Fears that soon bots and computers will outsmart human beings and take control of planet earth are unfounded as the world is still decades away from having computers think the way a human being does, former Apple Inc CEO John Sculley said here on Saturday. Expressing skepticism about the world hitting technological singularity by 2045 (when AI surpasses humans as the smartest life form on earth), he said a majority of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) today is still at pattern matching and predictive analytics. “Computers are getting faster and we will see absolutely incredible advancements, new type of companies and new ways of reimagining industries due to AI and Machine Learning (ML). But we have barely scratched the surface of artificial general intelligence (AGI).” “If I was a young person I would be absolutely working in AI & ML. But I would try to be practical about it and realise that the constructs exciting so many of us today are the same constructs I was working on when I was a graduate student a long time ago,” he said. Pointing out that though increasing automation will take away many jobs we take for granted today, he said AI & ML will become tools to help people amplify their skills and adapt to new kinds of jobs that would not have been possible earlier,” said Sculley, who was in town for the unveiling of co-working space Q-Hub, spread over 50,000 sq ft. The former Pepsi and Apple top honcho was also all praise for Indian talent for their skills in IT and healthcare and the ability to assimilate with local culture. “I suspect over the rest of the century Indians will take on a bigger role not only in the US but the whole world as India is churning out engineers and doctors in large numbers. Today Indians hold not just the most important jobs but also leadership jobs if you look at companies like Microsoft, Adobe, Google. There is no immigrant group that has assimilated better into the US than Indians, unlike the Japanese or Chinese,” he said. He, however, expressed concern over the US’ new immigration policies and said they were stifling innovation. “US capitalism is built on innovation, which comes from getting talent to come to the US as our education system is extremely uncompetitive in maths and science. It really concerns a lot of us that the immigration doors have been closed down. He pointed out that in the hitech sector a lot of big companies were opening up large development centres in Canada because it has an immigration system based on skills and merit. “It’s really frustrating that students come to the US as we have excellent universities, but graduates can’t stay back so we are losing all that talent because of the most ridiculous policy.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/robots-decades-away-from-outsmarting-humans-sculley/articleshow/70624259.cms
2019-08-10,"At this bar, AI decides who’s being served",Daily Mirror,"It’s a struggle that many thirsty drinkers have experienced, but the days of having to elbow your way to the bar are a thing of the past at one London bar. The bar, called 5cc Harrild & Sons, has enlisted the help of an artificial intelligence system to help the bartenders. The AI bar uses a facial recognition system developed by DataSparQ, that puts customers in an ‘intelligently virtual’ queue. This ensures customers get their hands on a drink based on the order they arrived, and not based on who has the sharpest elbows. John Wyllie, managing director at DataSparQ, said: “Queuing is a part of British life that we all have to endure — but we wanted to do something to improve the experience. “It’s the uncertainty of waiting times alongside queue jumpers that’s adversely affecting consumer behaviours in bars and pubs. “The AI Bar ensures it’s a hassle free, first come, first served system that makes ordering drinks more convenient for both drinkers and bar staff alike.” The AI bar system comprises three parts: a camera, a display screen, and DataSparQ’s software. The screen displays a live feed from the camera, which is positioned to record all the patrons waiting for a drink. The DataSparQ system notes the order in which patrons approach the bar, placing a circle with a number around their face on the screen. The facial recognition tech ensures each person keeps their place in line even if they momentarily leave the camera’s view. Before bartenders worry that they’ll be out of a job, DataSparQ has reassured that: “The tech isn’t designed to replace bar staff, it’s there to help them become more efficient.” The AI bar also helps to speed up ID checks. If a customer looks underage, the system will prompt them to have their ID ready, or let staff know if they’ve already been checked. In future, DataSparQ also hopes to add features like the ability for customers to reorder their drinks while still in the queue, and to set up tabs based on your face.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/at-this-bar-ai-decides-whos-being-served/articleshow/70614104.cms
2019-08-07,IIT Kanpur to provide AI-based tech for the protection and conservation of UP wildlife,Kanwardeep Singh,"BAREILLY : IIT Kanpur and the UP forest department have joined hands for technological solutions to protect and conserve forest, wildlife and bio-diversity in Uttar Pradesh . A team of 3D LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) mapping and artificial intelligence experts from IITK paid a visit to have a first-hand feel of constraints faced by frontline staff. Feedback was collected from staff and prototypes of new technology were demonstrated for their benefit. LiDAR is a remote sensing survey method that measures distance to a target by illuminating it with laser light, and measuring the reflected light with a sensor. This included demonstration of ‘tree stock’ mapping using LiDAR in Sonaripur range of Dudhwa national park, which can detect the amount of biomass and wood , illegal actions and fire in forests. This technology can also be helpful for modelling moving objects in the forest. Divulging details about the brief stay of IIT experts at Dudhwa, field director Sanjay Pathak said, “The experts arrived earlier this week and spent a few days at the reserve meeting officials and collecting information about challenges they face. Professor Salil Goel and his team demonstrated the use of 3D LiDAR in the mapping of forest and recording various parameters of trees, such as density, diameter, height and numbers.” “Professor Nishchal K Verma and his research students demonstrated advanced algorithms for AI-based event-triggered machine vision technology for animals, using thermal and vision cameras in day and night, for timely assistance. This technology is helpful for identification and counting of animals, behavioural study and analysis, generation of alerts for timely assistance to rescue injured animals, and intelligent data analysis for knowledge generation. The technology was demonstrated in Salukapur campus under South Sonaripur Range, in the presence of deputy directors and range officers,” he added. Pathak further said, “The experts have returned to Kanpur with a realistic view of constraints we face and first-hand experience, based on which they would be able to suggest suitable technological solutions. If everything goes right, Dudhwa will soon have AI-based monitoring system.” Deputy director (buffer) Anil Patel said, “The biggest challenge in buffer areas is the risk of man-animal conflict. We’ve asked the IIT experts to help us in developing a system that will alert us, whenever a wild animal strays out of the forest. If we are alerted in time, it would minimise our response time and help in initiating their rescue at the earliest.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/iit-kanpur-to-provide-ai-based-tech-for-the-protection-and-conservation-of-up-wildlife/articleshow/70564654.cms
2019-08-07,This entrepreneur is taking AI to rural Tamil Nadu,M T Saju,"Microbiology and robotics may not be directly connected, but it was after completing her course in the first subject that Suriya Prabha fell in love with the latter. Attracted by the way students are trained in artificial intelligence (AI) abroad, Prabha started learning software coding online. Now she uses her knowledge in the play-way teaching method, through which she teaches machine learning and AI to middle school children in rural Tamil Nadu . Prabha has so far trained more than 2,500 students in 25 government-run schools in the remote pockets of Virudhunagar , Ramanathapuram , Madurai , and Theni districts. Prabha formed a team of six to implement her project. The first step began with kindling interest of kids in robotics using tech toys such as Kano, Sphero, Mekamon, Littlebits, Cozmo and Microbit. “We make the children code the tech toys using blockbased programming. We train them to build an android app using (Amazon Web Service) cloud-based AI. This exercise gives them confidence to experiment,” said Prabha. The team also uses fun projects with the help of AI developer kits. “Students are trained on how the AI can be used to identify mood, pose and objects with AI developer kits like Google AIY Kit, Amazon AWS Deeplens, Intel Neural Compute Stick and Google Coral and NVIDIA Jetson,” she said. It was while training students at a school in Virudhunagar that a Class VI student, S Rakesh, wanted to find a solution to the increasing two-wheeler accidents in his home town. After the first session, he came up with an idea of fixing an alert system on helmets so that those who use it will be alerted if he they are riding rashly. We developed a helmet based on his idea. It was a great success,” said Prabha. Acquiring tech skills is not easy. Even though the government is working on it, students in rural pockets don’t have access to it. “The three-day course will help kindle interest in kids. The government should also focus on empowering schools with an AI lab. If we want to make India an AI superpower, we need to empower our kids,” she said. “Most advanced education and training programmes in the country are meant for the urban population. The rural pockets are widely neglected. My idea is to show the world that I can use my programme to address the needs of rural India,” said Prabha. India’s position is 54 in the Bloomberg Innovation Index 2019. “We need to sow the seed of innovation in kids and help build their confidence to ensure problem-solving through technology. It’s high time we had an AI lab in all our government-run schools,” she said. Prabha recently trekked to the government higher secondary school in Meghamalai in Theni. “It was a great experience. I am looking for more remote areas like this, but there are challenges. There are few supporters of a woman entrepreneur and a project aimed for the rural populace. But I have decided to go ahead,” said Prabha, who will be sharing her experience at the TEDx event to be held in the city on August 11.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/this-entrepreneur-is-taking-ai-to-rural-tamil-nadu/articleshow/70563563.cms

He, in fact, doesn’t like to be called a VC investor — he prefers the title “venture assistant”, someone whose job is to help out promising businesses. Khosla, an IIT-Delhi and Stanford alumnus who cofounded Sun Microsystems in 1982 and later started his own firm Khosla Ventures, doesn’t believe in attending board meetings, placing greater emphasis on one-to-ones with entrepreneurs. An industry veteran, he has witnessed many technology and business shifts over the past three decades, but the 64-year-old has no immediate plans to hang up his boots. His company has made several bets in the clean-tech space and more recently, in biomedicine and robotics. Khosla Ventures’ recent successes include payments startups Square and Stripe and delivery firms Instacart and DoorDash. Khosla is also an investor in Impossible Foods, which serves up meatless burgers. In a chat with TOI, he covered a range of topics, from the origins of the startup ecosystems in India and the US, regulation of the Big Tech companies and American politics to opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). You visit India every few years. What do you think of current startup ecosystem in India compared to its state four-five years ago? It’s clearly getting more entrepreneurial. There are higher quality startups and I met about a dozen of them today. They are as good as Y Combinator startups that I see in the US. That’s encouraging. They are still mostly in the software domain and narrower areas, unlike in the US where we see very broad domains. This is why I was encouraging people to look at other areas such as food, 3D printing and manufacturing. Look, this kind of ecosystem needs some successful entrepreneurs who can mentor the next generation. Then things get bigger and better. People like Sachin Bansal start companies again, then scale gets larger. India will do well as an entrepreneurial ecosystem, especially globally. Do you think Flipkart exit was a pivotal moment for Indian startup ecosystem? Flipkart would have been successful no matter what. But the exit created enough liquidity for people from Flipkart to start their own companies and invest in other startups. Or they can mentor people at other startups. Exits like Flipkart are pivotal in changing the mindset of entrepreneurs that we can build larger companies. What are the areas where Indian ecosystem must catch up with China or US? Fintech is very clear. There is Ant Financial in China, but there is nothing comparable to that in India. China has done well, and they are a little bit ahead of India in startups; whether it’s Alibaba, Tencent or Baidu, each has picked an area of its own. I am hopeful we will see that emerge in India too. In fintech, Indian firms have faced unfavourable policies, and RBI has a conservative approach on issues such as cryptocurrency. What is regulators’ role in growing the ecosystem? You know, regulators have a serious responsibility — they have to make sure fraud does not happen. But by and large, Indian regulators have been very open-minded compared to their counterparts in other parts of the world. Take for instance the Digital Sky initiative (for drone operators). Aadhaar was a good example, but UPI is even better one. Not enough startups have popped up to take advantage of UPI, payment systems or banking/new insurance. But I get the sense that regulators are working with startups in a good way. Blockchain is the only area where we haven’t seen huge progress. And you know, blockchain had one disadvantage — all its use cases were illegal and so regulators naturally (were against it). All its uses were monetary. Non-monetary uses of blockchain are very valuable. Data privacy should be done in blockchain, so you don’t have to trust anybody. Nandan’s [Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani] new effort around federated data is great. Setting new standards will enable a new set of entrepreneurs. In digital infrastructure, India is ahead of many countries. Look at Aadhaar, UPI and Digital Sky; these government efforts make the scene more progressive. In the US, things are owned by a private corporation, whether it is Facebook for messaging or Google for search. So, setting up standards is a really good idea. RBI’s stand on cryptocurrency has led to some startups shutting down... I am supportive of the stand that the RBI has taken. I think Bitcoin’s use is mostly illegal. If you are going to have an orderly society, you can’t have money outside the system. But having blockchain-based services like privacy will be a great idea. What is the mood in Silicon Valley? Many new firms, like Slack and Zoom, are getting listed, but there’s also the talk of regulating Big Tech. The regulatory stuff does not impact startups; it gives them an advantage. Bigger technology companies have more constraints and anti-trust concerns. It may impact the buyout market, where big companies were acquiring startups. Some US presidential candidates have proposed breaking up big companies. As you know, politics is politics. You must take extreme positions to get noticed. On most policies, very few candidates are taking positions that they will carry through, like healthcare for all at a cost of trillions of dollars. And frankly, there are 20 of them, so they have to distinguish themselves. They will all move to the centre to take on Donald Trump. How should anti-trust regulators in markets like India view the developments? I think data privacy is an issue and steps are being taken; Indian regulators should keep an eye on that. Antitrust, I would let the world sort it out. India is a competitive market anyway, and no matter what area, foreign companies don’t do as well here as they do in other emerging markets. That’s because Indian entrepreneurs are pretty good and competitive. Tell me which telecom company can compete with Reliance Jio? They can’t, because of the bets Mukesh Ambani places. Indian government’s tech policy talks about treating data as a public good, and data localisation. Is that the way forward? Look, there are two things. One is what is fair and what you can get away with regulating. Outside the advertising model, data is still valuable, but not as valuable as people think. My view is that most of the artificial intelligence (AI) systems will need new kinds of data, and not old data. If you ask six-yearolds to learn what is a table, you don’t give them six million examples of a table. You give them three and they do a pretty good job of telling what is shaped like a table. I am very confident that the next generation of AI systems won’t need huge amounts of data in the next five years. Privacy may still be an issue, but data I don’t know. Some investors think India can take advantage of technology skillset in AI and machine learning, as it did during IT boom. What are the challenges on this front ? India has talent. There are two kinds of AI. One is researching and developing new techniques. And then there is applied AI, where I think Indian companies will do really well. You take Healthify, they are doing a pretty good job of applying AI. Research in AI is the domain of PhDs. I haven’t seen much activity in India where they may be developing new algorithms and looking at new domains. In hyperlocal delivery space in the US, Khosla Ventures is an investor in DoorDash and Instacart. Is this segment the future of commerce? Swiggy and Zomato are burning a lot of capital here. Both companies [Instacart and DoorDash] have very different trajectories and strategies. DoorDash can become very large; Instacart is in the specific area of groceries. There is a tendency in India to back the winner rather than multiple players. However, I don’t track the India market that closely. DoorDash faced controversy over treatment of gig economy workers. What is the ideal way to deal with it? Once a problem emerges, the next generation of solutions comes up. It is always an iterative process. Now that the problems have surfaced, startups are addressing them. Whoever treats workers better is going to get better workers. You will see a generation of startups working for hourly employees. Any startup you regret not investing in? Everyone wishes they had invested in Airbnb. We looked at them pretty late, in Series C.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/startups/people/next-gen-ai-systems-wont-need-huge-amount-of-data-vinod-khosla/articleshow/70530235.cms
2019-08-01,Trending Now: Personalised Medicine; 3-D printed organs and Artificial Intelligence in healthcare,Brandwire,"In a world where fiction meets reality and technology transcends the imagination of the average human, it comes as no surprise that we can now engineer new life. Technological advances in biology have caught the world by storm and revolutionized ideas, concepts, products and services. For instance: Healthcare services. Every human being is unique. This is reason enough to believe that healthcare must apply a novel method that stands in contrast to the one-size-fits-all approach. Indeed, disease treatment and preventive strategies must be developed taking into consideration each individual thus leading to the new concept of Precision medicine or Personalized Medicine. Taking shape steadily, Personalised Medicine takes into account individual variability in genes and also the personal lifestyle of the person. Using Artificial Intelligence in healthcare offers breakthrough predictive analytics that aids early detection of deadly diseases with greater accuracy.

2019-07-26,This startup uses AI to make hiring hassle-free for companies,Swati Rathor,"HYDERABAD: 'May I help you?' can be the most comforting words to the ears of those in need of help. For Hari Krishna Reddy, these words opened the door to the brave world of entrepreneurship. Hari's home and college in Warangal were separated by a gruelling 21km commute. Every time he stepped out of his home to go to college, his mother would ask him to fetch household items on his way back. He sensed a business opportunity here and much before the Big Baskets and Grofers of the world came into existence, he started delivering household items to about 80 homes for a subscription fee of Rs 30 per month. At the end of six months, he made enough money to pay off part of his tuition fee. While this experience helped him become self-reliant, it gave him hands-on experience in dealing with customers, shopkeepers as well as team members. Today, after nearly 14 years of work in the corporate world straddling various sectors and working in the area of recruitments, Hari is back for a second innings in the world of entrepreneurship with Param.ai that he has set up along with his partner Ashish Kumar Sahoo. The startup uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help corporates recruit talent in a hassle-free and transparent manner. Stating that there is a lot of innovation taking place in the HR technology space in India, he says, ""We have built a talent intelligence platform that can be deployed by multiple users in the organisation, such as recruiters, hiring managers, CHROs (chief human resources officers), decision makers and influencers, to make databacked hiring decisions."" Hari explains that the USP of its platform is that it can throw up top five applications for the job role for which the company is hiring and also state the rationale behind choosing these candidates over others. Param.ai is able to do this task as its platform analyses the previous recruitment data of the company and understands the 'hiring pattern' based on multiple criteria, such as educational qualifications, compensations and experience, among others. ""This not only helps save time for the recruiter but also leads to better conversion rates and candidate experience,"" he says. The startup has been sectoragnostic and its customer base includes the likes of Maruti Suzuki, IndiGo and Kotak Mahindra Bank. While the HR tech startup has been helping firms in the recruitment area, in the coming days it intends to build solutions for 'internal mobility' within a firm that will help companies hire talent for a particular job role from within the organisation. ""There are many companies that have a large employee base in the country with over 10,000-12,000. While they have the concept of internal job postings, it doesn't always lead to desired results and is not transparent. We want to build an AI-based solution that can help a company engage with an employee to figure out what his or her goals are, which area they would like to work in, what are the new skills that they would like to acquire… and offer them new job roles,"" he says, adding that the idea is to build talent pipelines instantly using AI to find top prospects from the existing database. Besides, it is also using analytics not only on the recruitment data but also the overall HR data to have better insights into questions, such as what kind of people are hired for a particular job role? How is compensation benchmarked? What are the skills in demand, and whether existing employees are in tune or not?",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/startups/companies/this-startup-uses-ai-to-make-hiring-hassle-free-for-companies/articleshow/70388299.cms
2019-07-25,Seeking AI help to find Geeta’s parents,Sagar Choukse,"INDORE: For deaf and mute Geeta, the girl who had strayed into Pakistan and later returned to India after 14 years, hope of finding her biological parents seems to have kindled once again… thanks to a mobile application that uses artificial intelligence to generate ‘highly realistic transformations’ of faces to make a person look younger or older. Sign language expert, Gyanendra Purohit, who has been helping Geeta communicate with others, has used this application to create Geeta’s image of early teens. “After returning to India in 2015, efforts were made to reunite her with her biological parents but they failed. We have however not lost hope and have decided to help the deaf and mute girl through this mobile application, ” Purohit, told TOI. He said that with the help of this application, they had tried to create a ‘younger’ image of Geeta by using her photograph taken in 2011. “In the ‘transformed’ image, Geeta looks around 12-year old. The image has been posted on a Facebook page – ‘Reunite Geeta, a deaf girl, with family’ two days back. We have started receiving queries and clues from people across the country,” Purohit said. The sign language expert said that help would also be sought from district administration and police to popularize the social media page to get any information that can lead to finding the girl’s biological parents. In last three years, over 50 couples had claimed that Geeta was their missing child but none of these claims could be verified. Sometime back a matrimonial advertisement was also posted on Facebook, to help Geeta get married but that effort too yielded no result. ==",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/seeking-ai-help-to-find-geetas-parents/articleshow/70369693.cms
2019-07-21,The next big frontier: Using AI to solve social issues,Armaan Bhatnagar,"TOKYO: From revolutionizing how we communicate with our smartphones to ushering in a new era of personalization, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been at the forefront of technological innovation for the better part of the last decade. But the next big frontier in AI technology lies in combining machine learning with human skills to drive a positive change in society and resolve some of the biggest environmental challenges of our time. Google has already started tapping artificial intelligence to tackle various social and environmental challenges across the world and is betting big on some of its ongoing pilot projects being tested across the world, including in India. ""AI can help solve some of the most difficult social and environmental challenges in areas like healthcare, disaster prediction, environmental conservation, agriculture, or cultural preservation,” Google's AI head Jeff Dean said at the company's ' Solve with AI ' event in Tokyo. Dean said that Google recognized how AI systems can benefit the society at large and started its AI for Social Good programme with two areas of focus - research & engineering and empowering others to solve big problems. Since data fuels all AI algorithms, the US-based internet giant has identified several areas where machine learning can be used to analyze large data sets to help drive solutions. For instance, in the field of healthcare, the use of AI technology to detect Diabetic Retinopathy has already started showing positive results. ""Diabetic Retinopathy or DR is a complication of diabetes which can lead to blindness. The key to preventing the disease is through early screenings. However, in many places such as India, there aren’t enough specialists to do these screenings,"" Google's Health Product Manager Lily Peng said at the event. Lily Peng Peng demonstrated how Google, with the help of its sister firm Verily, has developed a machine learning system that can detect the disease in the images of the patient's retina with a high level of accuracy on par with human specialists. The technology has already been tested in partnership with healthcare professionals in India and the initial results ""have been encouraging"", she said. Aside from diabetic retinopathy, Peng said that Google is using machine learning models in two other areas of medical imaging - analyzing CT scans to predict early signs of lung cancers and detect lesions in pathology images to assist doctors with breast cancer metastases. Besides, Google is also working on developing AI algorithms to help offer communication support to people with speech and hearing disabilities. The company recently rolled out Project Euphonia, which aims to make communication easier for people suffering from speech impairments caused by neurological conditions such as ALS and Parkinson's disease. The project's aim, Google said, is to use AI models that can understand diverse speech patterns, such as impaired speech, to help people communicate with the world. ""The first step of our research effort is to ask volunteers to record voice samples that we can use to improve our speech recognition models. Once we have enough recordings from someone, our team builds a personalized communication system that works specifically for people who recorded their voice,"" said Google AI Product Manager Julie Cattiau. The goal is to transcribe in real-time what people say which can allow a variety of application, such as composing an email, speaking to other people and using assistive technology, she said. And it's not just Google that is driving these innovations. Wadhwani Institute for AI, a Mumbai-based non-profit organization that was recently shortlisted for a grant from Google, is helping apply AI innovation in agriculture and has developed technology to reduce crop loss in cotton farming. The institute's AI algorithm aims to help small farmers in India who struggle with the issue of pest damage and are unable to receive timely advice from experts to prevent damage to the crops, Wadhwani AI's VP (Products and Programmes) Raghu Dharmaraju said. The system enables farmers and extension workers to take photos of pest traps and use image classification models on their smartphones to count and identify the pests and receive suggestions such as what pesticides to spray and when. ""The goal at Wadhwani AI is to find gaps in large agriculture systems and fix them using AI,"" Dharamraju said. Rainforest Connection (RFC), a US-based firm that uses Google's open-source machine learning software TensorFlow to help reduce deforestation, is another such example. Topher White, CEO of Rainforest Connection, said that deforestation caused by illegal logging is the second largest contributor to carbon emissions. ""A single square kilometer forest we protect is equal to taking 1,000 cars off the road,"" he adds. How is RFC using AI to help conserve the environment? RFC has built a real-time detection and alert system for logging and environmental conservation in the rainforest. The system records the sounds of the rainforest with old cell phones installed high up in the trees. Once the audio goes to the cloud, the system uses Google TensorFlow to analyze the auditory data in real-time to listen for chainsaws, logging trucks, and to better understand the behavior of endangered species. ""Rainforest Connection’s (RFC) technology is already deployed in 10 countries on 5 continents protecting over 2000 square kilometers of forest area,"" White said. Google has rolled out several other AI research and engineering projects across the globe to stop illegal fishing, forecast floods, preserve ancient languages and conserve native bird species. Dean said that AI is now becoming a tool that can be used in a variety of fields that can significantly affect society, and not just in computer science. ""We are also providing tools like TensorFlow and training to empower more and more people and help them solve societal problems with the help of AI,"" Dean said.

2019-07-17,AI solves Rubik’s Cube in a fraction of a second,PTI,"LOS ANGELRS: Scientists have developed a new AI-based algorithm that can solve the Rubik’s Cube in a fraction of a second, without any specific domain knowledge or ingame coaching from humans. It was invented by a Hungarian architect in 1974. DeepCubeA, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm programmed by researchers at the University of California , Irvine (UCI) in the US can find the solution in a fraction of a second. This is no simple task considering that the cube has completion paths numbering in the billions but only one goal state — each of six sides displaying a solid colour — which apparently can’t be found through random moves, researchers said. The study, published in the journal ‘Nature Machine Intelligence’, demonstrated that DeepCubeA solved 100% of all test configurations, finding the shortest path to the goal state about 60% of the time.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/ai-solves-rubiks-cube-in-a-fraction-of-a-second/articleshow/70254940.cms
2019-07-16,"Banks use AI everywhere, from chatbots to validating cheques",Rachel Chitra,"NEW DELHI: In Axis Bank , cheque authentication today is largely done not by a human teller, but by an artificial intelligence (AI) system. It has multiple advantages. When someone tries to forge a signature, there are minute fissures, blots or anomalies that may not be visible to the human eye, but will become glaringly obvious to a trained bot (software robot). And if the account holder signs in a hurry and it’s not quite the same as in the bank’s system, the bot understands it’s actually a genuine signature. Only in instances where old age or disability has altered a person’s signature significantly does the bot pass on the query to a human. “But this is becoming rare, as our AI gets better with handling cheques and learns more,” says Ratan Kesh, executive VP and head of process transformation and customer experience at Axis Bank. “And because we handle millions of cheques every day, if we relied only on human tellers, it would result in fatigue, more mistakes and higher chances of fraud,” he says. Globally, banks are the biggest buyers of technology and among the fastest adopters of new tech. Indian banks are no exception. For them, AI is both about scale (for a large number of retail customers needing a common solution) and about customisation (for corporate customers having specific requirements). AI is being employed across divisions — in reconciliation (ATM reconciliation where balances are settled between different banks and their ATM networks when one bank customer uses another bank’s ATM), in treasury (to predict the possible direction of India’s bond market based on historical data), in fund management (for more data driven, parameters-set trading for wealth management clients), in fraud management (to prevent identity theft, money laundering using deposits or loan fraud) and in regulatory compliance (to assist bank employees, who may not know the entire labyrinth of rules and regulations the RBI has for banks). One of the biggest use cases for Indian banks is the deployment of chatbots. ICICI Bank ’s AI-powered virtual personal assistant iPal, launched in 2017, today addresses over 1.5 million queries a month. The bot not just answers questions, but can also pay bills, do fund transfers or recharge your mobile on your behalf. The bot can also handle complex queries on GST, government digital initiatives, service requests, ATM locations, branch details and IFSC codes. Say you have exhausted your credit card limit or missed a payment and want to know your options, the bot will provide them. Today, it’s accurate 90% of the time. “Where our bots sometimes fail is in detecting human emotions like sarcasm, anger or humour. And usually we have human assistants to take over if the bot cannot handle a query,” says Madhivanan Balakrishnan, chief digital officer at ICICI Bank. A big part of AI in chatbots is natural language processing (NLP). When bots have insufficient information on a query such as “I want to recharge my <mobile number>”, then the bot knows it needs to get details such as recharge amount, bank account number, etc. Bots are also handled to adjust for human error. Like for a person wanting to ‘recharge’, the bot will even accept text variations like ‘recharg’, ‘rchrg’, ‘re-charge’, ‘refill’, ‘add balance’, ‘load mobile’, and ‘topup’. HDFC Bank’s e-virtual assistant Eva has been programmed to work with multiple channels such as the bank’s website, app, Google Assistant and Alexa. Eva – which like so many other chatbots follows the industry norm in being female – can handle 7,500 FAQs and has till date had more than 16 million conversations. She has been integrated with online travel aggregators and service providers, so she can book bus tickets or chart out trips for you. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s Keya can talk in both English and Hindi. The bank’s senior executive VP Puneet Kapoor says Keya can recognise customer intent in 75% of cases and can independently conclude over 11% of all calls serviced by the voicebot without any human intervention — a 5x increase over the earlier self-service rate. “This amounts to over 1.7 million customer calls per month that Keya executes on her own,” he says. Talent hunt Large-sized Indian banks today have IT teams of more than a hundred each, while mid-sized ones have 20-40 each. They look for talent that knows programming languages, mathematical concepts, networking, have an aptitude and interest in banking and finance. “We build many of our automation solutions inhouse,” says Madhivanan Balakrishnan, chief digital officer at ICICI Bank.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/banks-use-ai-everywhere-from-chatbots-to-validating-cheques/articleshow/70237317.cms
2019-07-15,"Now, Artificial Intelligence to decode Gandhian literature",Parth Shastri,"AHMEDABAD: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced formation of ‘Gandhipedia,’ an online repository about Mahatma Gandhi, during her budget speech, citing the initiative as a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi in 150th birth anniversary this year. The project is comprises of a team consisting of experts from IIT Kharagpur (IIT-K) and IIT Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn). Three primary members of the team include professor Animesh Mukherjee from the Complex Networks Research Group (CNeRG), IIT-K, as primary investigator (PI), professor Mayank Singh from IIT-Gn Lingo group as co-primary investigator (Co-PI) and Dr T S Kumbar, librarian, both from IIT-Gn. The project is supported by National Council of Science Museums (NSCM) under the ministry of culture. “Gandhipedia is an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled tool to access the works of the Mahatma Gandhi in a completely indexed and digitised form. It will support natural language queries, strong visualisation support to observe how the social network of the Mahatma changed over his lifetime spatially as well as temporally,” said professor Mukherjee. In run-up to the 150th birth anniversary celebration, Gandhi Heritage Portal (GHP) has already put a huge database on Gandhian literature in digital format. The repository includes 100 volumes of Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi. Professor Mayank Singh explains that how Gandhipedia plans to take the work forward. “We are leveraging AI for searching, indexing and visualization of data based on the text. Result of the initiative can be answer to queries such as how Mahatma interacted with different personalities over a period of time, how many times a specific person or place finds mention in the texts, preparing graphs on the basis of time and location,” said professor Singh. “We are collaborating with various Gandhian institutes for the same as a number of texts come under copyright purview.” The project also aims at digitizing resources such as doctoral works which are not included in conventional Gandhian literature. “The end-result would be fully-searchable texts like Google books ,” he added. The budget or duration of the project is not yet fixed, the researchers aim at long-term association to take Mahatma Gandhi to the new audience in new format. The entire database generated would be available in public domain, added researchers.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/now-ai-to-decode-gandhian-literature/articleshow/70220239.cms
2019-07-13,Govt to use AI to curb frauds in Ayushman Bharat,Sushmi Dey,"NEW DELHI: The rapidly increasing popularity of the government’s flagship health insurance scheme Ayushman Bharat has also made it equally vulnerable to frauds. This has prompted the government to put in put in place extra layers of protection by using artificial intelligence , monitoring utilisation trends, and forming standard treatment protocols to check irregularities including overcharging, wrong billing, over testing, beneficiary duplication and abuse in referral mechanism. While the scheme has touched almost 30 lakh beneficiaries within 10 months of its launch in September last year, the anti-fraud unit of the National Health Authority (NHA) - the government’s implementing agency for the scheme – is proactively detecting potential fraud cases and conducting detailed investigation before taking action. The NHA has issued show-cause notices to 48 hospitals across the country so far, out of which 31 hospitals have been suspended following detailed investigation, a senior official said. “For three such cases that were confirmed as fraud, first information report (FIRs) have been filed by the State Anti Fraud Unit and they have been de-empanelled already. Action has been initiated to recover the amount claimed falsely by the hospitals and additional penalties have also been imposed as per the anti-fraud guidelines,” the official said. The irregularities detected by the anti-fraud wing of NHA includes cases like abuse of referral mechanism in a few hospitals where doctors in certain public hospitals were illegally issuing referral slips for a private hospital in return for pecuniary benefits. In another such case, the anti-fraud wing of the agency observed the treating doctor in a public hospital was referring the case to his own private clinic even as there was no specialist available to treat the patient in the private clinic. “These cases were detected because of strict gatekeeping. We investigated these cases without any delay and disciplinary action was initiated immediately,” another official said. Fraud cases also include billing of services not provided or wrong coding of packages to charge a higher amount etc. To keep a check on such tendencies of hospitals to overcharge and other related issues, NHA has introduced all-inclusive package rates. Hospitals were also found abusing the pre-authorisation norm, which is actually meant to keep a check on claims. The pre-authorisation needs to be approved within six hours of admitting and treating patients under the scheme and if the authority concerned does not approve within six hours, it is deemed to be approved . Some hospitals were found initiating the process late at night when there would be no one to approve. To address this loophole, now regular requests are being entertained only between 10 am and 5 pm. At other times, only emergencies will be looked into. Besides, all pre-authorisation and claims transactions are carried out on-line basis for efficiency and complete transparency. NHA has also designed IT systems and processes with checks and balances for all processes – beneficiary identification, transaction management system, funds flow, claims payment etc. NHA maintains it is walking a tightrope to strengthen the system by tightening the noose around private hospitals and insurance companies while ensuring a smooth access of health care services for beneficiaries of the scheme.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-to-use-ai-to-curb-frauds-in-ayushman-bharat/articleshow/70200019.cms
2019-07-11,Nivruti Rai’s AI engine is now used across Intel,Shilpa Phadnis,"About six years ago, when Nivruti Rai travelled to Folsom in California on work, she happened to fall sick. She was then an engineering manager driving IP development for Intel from India. She wanted to check her temperature, but her hotel didn’t have a thermometer. Phones, laptops are all readily available to us, why not a thermometer, she wondered. Her team was then responsible for building temperature sensors for computers. The sensors would determine when to exercise the cooling solution, depending on how hot the computer had become. Building a temp sensor for a computer was way harder than building one to monitor human skin temperature. So Rai thought of building a sensor for the latter, but she wanted to build some intelligence on top of that. It was outside her area of work, but she succeeded in convincing her manager to give her four software engineers, to supplement her team of hardware ones. And with a set of interns, they built a sensing and then an artificial intelligence solution. Initially it was like a health tracker, which she called Persona. Put a finger on it, and it would tell the temperature. “I used to have acid reflux and I would really suffer. If I fed into this smart engine that I have this problem, that I have low blood pressure, and this is what I’m eating, it actually advises that Nivruti stop, you need to sleep, or that my problem is going to kick in, be prepared,” Rai says. As the team developed the product, it became a general-purpose inferencing engine, useful in a variety of instances. However, few outside the team realised what it was capable of. Rai, who is now Intel’s India head, recounts how senior architects initially laughed off her idea. But her audacity and persistence paid off. About two years ago, when Intel was looking for an inference engine, it discovered that the solution developed by the India team could be that. Intel called it Spring Hill. Today, it goes into many of Intel’s global products. “The kind of energy, the hunger we have, the complex problems we deal with, the amount of data India has, I honestly think a lot of Intel’s innovations in the coming decades will come from India,” Rai says.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/startups/people/nivruti-rais-ai-engine-is-now-used-across-intel/articleshow/69951676.cms

2019-07-09,Software robots are taking over many manual processes,"Sujit John,Shilpa Phadnis&Swati Bharadwaj","Software robots — or bots as they are called — are doing to business processes what automation did to manufacturing decades ago. For HR divisions dealing with hundreds of resumes, there are bots today that can go through resumes against job descriptions, figure out the most relevant ones, and even schedule interviews with those candidates. For contact centre agents, there are bots that can quickly identify, catalogue, and analyse a caller’s intent and help get the answers customers want, fast. For those in finance & accounting, there are hundreds of processes between the moment someone places an order, and till the cash is received. The invoice needs to be taken, looked into, followed up on multiple systems, reconciled, the payment needs to be followed up, and when the payment comes, that needs to be locked, and a reconciliation undertaken again. The entire process can today be done by bots. Robotic process automation (RPA) is one of the biggest disruptions happening at the workplace. RPA itself uses a variety of technologies. Such as document recognition, screen scraping — which is the process of collecting screen display data from one application and translating it so that another application can display it — handwriting recognition , and optical character recognition (OCR), which allows a computer to distinguish, for instance, a B from a D, even if the size or font is different. In combination with technologies like natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI), the possibilities are infinite. Where companies deal with hundreds of invoices, these invoices could be coming in different formats — pdf, tiff, jpeg. One can use AI systems to train bots to understand for each invoice, which is the invoice number, which the due date, which the total. And as it trains with more and more invoices, the better it gets. The ANZ Banking Group was one of the early ones to adopt RPA aggressively, and the lead for that was taken by its shared services centre in Bengaluru. “They automated lots of processes, created thousands of bots across HR, technology, finance,” says Ankur Kothari, co-founder of Automation Anywhere, one of the three biggest RPA companies in the world, alongside UiPath and Blue Prism. In 2017, SSON Analytics, a provider of data insights into the outsourcing industry, said ANZ had reduced manual processes by 85% (equivalent to 400 full-time employees). It said customer processes that used to take up to five days to execute, had come down to 24 hours. Errors had reduced. And if the marketing team planned a new campaign to promote credit card sign-ups, they could use bots to quickly deal with the process involved. Previously, they had to plan this months in advance in order to hire enough new (often temporary) staff to deal with the influx of new credit card applications. Suman Reddy Eadunuri, MD of RPA service provider Pegasystems India, says Radial, which runs a 9,000-person contact centre for many retail brands, reduced common customer service processes from minutes to seconds, reduced call handle times down to 30 seconds, and improved first contact resolution up to 6 percentage points following RPA implementation. Blue Prism’s managing director for India, Peter Gartenberg, says digital workers (bots) are faster, more accurate, and ensure more compliance & security. In credit checks for loan approvals, where lots of data need to be pulled in, digital workers can do many things parallely, unlike humans who can do it only sequentially. “Digital workers are more accurate because humans don’t like to do repetitive work and get bored (leading to mistakes). They also ensure compliance, because they do what they are told, unlike humans who make intentional and inadvertent errors,” says Gartenberg. RPA is also highly cost-effective, says Raghunath Subramanian, CEO of UiPath India. “We have seen customers getting massive returns in three months, six months. No other project can promise this,” he says. This is to a great extent because RPA companies have developed platforms that have made it very simple for even nonprogrammers to create bots. But RPA also means a lot of today’s manual work will disappear. Inevitably, those doing the work will have to upskill to take on roles that are more creative. “People have also become supervisors of bots and people. If I was running a 20-people team, doing x amount of transactions, now with 20 people and 30 bots, I’m doing x plus y transactions,” says Kothari.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/software-robots-are-taking-over-many-manual-processes/articleshow/70136475.cms
2019-07-02,AI will tell the police if suspect is lying or not,Bloomberg,"American psychologist Paul Ekman’s research on facial expressions spawned a whole new career of human lie detectors more than four decades ago. Artificial intelligence could soon take their jobs. While the US has pioneered the use of automated technologies to reveal the hidden emotions and reactions of suspects, the technique is still nascent and a whole flock of entrepreneurial ventures are working to make it more efficient and less prone to false signals. Facesoft, a UK start-up, says it has built a database of 300 million images of faces, some of which have been created by an AI system modeled on the human brain, The Times reported. The system built by the company can identify emotions like anger, fear and surprise based on micro-expressions which are often invisible to the casual observer. “If someone smiles insincerely, their mouth may smile, but the smile doesn’t reach their eyes — micro-expressions are more subtle than that and quicker,” co-founder and chief executive officer Allan Ponniah, who’s also a plastic and reconstructive surgeon in London , told the newspaper. Facesoft has approached police in Mumbai about using the system for monitoring crowds to detect the evolving mob dynamics, Ponniah said. It has also touted its product to police forces in the UK. The use of AI algorithms among police has stirred controversy recently. A research group whose members include Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. , Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc published a report in April stating that current algorithms aimed at helping police determine who should be granted bail, parole or probation, and which help judges make sentencing decisions, are potentially biased, opaque, and may not even work. The Partnership on AI found that such systems are already in widespread use in the US and were gaining a foothold in other countries too. It said it opposes any use of these systems.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/ai-will-tell-the-police-if-suspect-is-lying-or-not/articleshow/70035274.cms
2019-06-30,This startup is solving restaurants’ woes in Tricity through artificial intelligence,TNN,"PantryDash is a one-stop shop for restaurants to purchase all required supplies By: Hardik Anand CHANDIGARH: PantryDash, a startup founded by former PU student Anirudh Arora with help of the university’s Centre for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, is helping solve restaurants’ problems in Tricity through artificial intelligence (AI). The startup is a one-stop shop for restaurants to purchase all required supplies, including fruits and vegetables, poultry, meats, packaging and housekeeping material, groceries, dairy etc. The restaurants are provided with a point of sale (POS) system by PantryDash, which through AI keeps a record of their daily sale of items and then creates an order of raw materials for them on its own. “From production, logistics to supply, our startup takes care of it all. We have our own farms where we grow raw vegetables that we deliver to restaurants. Our technology saves restaurants’ time because they don’t have to make orders again and again from different vendors everyday. As per their requirements, their orders are made and delivered to them fresh everyday from one place,” said Arora, who passed out from UIET in 2017. The idea to start Pantry-Dash came from Arora’s previous startup, DND (daily nutritional diet), which was also incubated at Panjab University’s entrepreneurship centre. “DND is a chain of restaurants that promotes healthy eating. To run our restaurant, we used to face problems in ordering supplies everyday from multiple vendors. So we thought we should create an online marketplace that solves this problem,” Arora said. Within two months of the launch, PantryDash has partnered with more than 30 restaurants in Tricity. “We partnered with farmers in Haryana and Punjab, wherein we took a share of their land to practice farming through aeroponics and hydroponics . We have also partnered with poultry farms. The biggest challenge was the logistics that required a major funding. We secured it through another entrepreneur, who was an initial investor in a cab-aggregator service,” said Arora.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/this-startup-is-solving-restaurants-woes-in-tricity-through-artificial-intelligence/articleshow/70008998.cms
2019-06-29,On 'course': BTech in artificial intelligence makes IIT-Hyderabad a hot pick for students,Preeti Biswas,"(Representative image) HYDERABAD: The newly-introduced course of BTech in artificial intelligence (AI) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, (IIT-H) has emerged as a hot pick among qualified candidates. For the first time, 60 of the top 1,000 rankers across India chose IIT-H over others. “We had expected this trend of many students choosing IIT-H as the quality of education is now on par with the older IITs. Flexibility and dynamic programmes being offered in newer technologies is making students prefer IIT-H,” said Prof UB Desai, director of IIT-H, adding that this year students from other disciplines will also get to have an opportunity to learn minor in AI. IIT-H became the first institute in the country to offer an exclusive BTech in AI course from the academic year 2019-20 with an intake of 20 students. The opening rank for the new course was 478 in general category and it closed at 657. The opening rank for CSE also saw a massive improvement from last year’s 443 to 203 this year. “What surprised us was that many students this year chose BTech course in AI as against regular CSE despite having a better score. It’s a sign that students have realised the potential of AI as a career-prospect considering the scope of research and jobs in the industry,” said Vineeth N Balasubramanian, associate professor, department of computer science engineering, IIT-H. In the first phase, 319 seats were allotted at IIT-H, up from last year’s 294 with most of the top rankers opting for electrical, mechanical and civil engineering apart from CSE. According to the figures, 49 seats were allotted in computer science engineering, 48 in mechanical engineering, 47 in electrical engineering , 40 in civil engineering and 35 in chemical engineering among others. Aiming to fill 14% of the seats in every course with girls, 50 seats were allotted to female candidates with an opening rank of 1,026 in computer science and closing rank of 1,586 in computer science.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/on-course-btech-in-ai-makes-iit-h-a-hot-pick-for-students/articleshow/69998300.cms
2019-06-26,"AI, IoT fuel new chip designs, and India is at the centre of it","Swati Bharadwaj,Akhil George&Sujit John","• Google, Facebook, Amazon, Alibaba, Apple, Samsung and Microsoft are all accelerating efforts to design chips • Most are poaching talent from traditional chip designers like Intel, Qualcomm, Nvidia, and from each other • Google’s setting up a team in Bengaluru for chip design, and the majority of its 66 job openings in the city are for this function • Qualcomm has 263 job openings now in India (130 in Bengaluru, 107 in Hyderabad), second only to California at 458. Only other country with a three digit figure is China • Intel’s city-wise job openings has Bengaluru at the top, with 403, followed by Hillsboro (Oregon, US) at 244 Put all of that together, and what we have is a picture of something dramatically new happening in chip design, and India, alongside the US, being at the centre of it. That new is an effort to integrate new digital technologies such as AI, machine learning, and internet-of-things (IoT) with silicon. The more tightly software and hardware features are integrated, the better the applications run. Apple did it for iPhones, and is now increasingly doing it for other products. Google’s doing it for its Pixel phones and AI-controlled gadgets. Amazon’s created a chip focused on AI, and is working on one for its cloud infrastructure. The traditional chip giants, at risk of losing business from some of their biggest customers, are on the same path. “Silicon has come back into vogue. There’s this big resurgence of specialised hardware, of chip design,” says Anirudh Devgan, president of Cadence Design Systems, one of the world’s biggest suppliers of software tools to the semiconductor industry. He says specialised AI chips can beat the traditional CPU by orders of magnitude. “You will see more of the car companies designing their own chips, cloud providers doing it, mobile phone companies and systems companies doing it,” he says. Vincent Roche, CEO of Analog Devices, which designs chips that sense real-world phenomena like temperature, vibration, and air quality, says such analog chips integrated with AI algorithms can analyse and interpret data much better, and have a variety of applications, including predicting machine failure in factories. Pradip Dutta, MD for India of semiconductor tools company Synopsys, says IoT-driven chips are going into the sensors on big turbines and aircraft engine blades to instantly communicate data about how they are functioning. “Security is another big area that’s being integrated into hardware design,” he says. The US and China both have excellent chip design talent. But the US talent is just not enough for US companies, and it is to India that they typically look for the talent they need. Bipin Pendyala, managing committee member of the Hyderabad Software Enterprises Association (HYSEA), says new developments in chip design has spurred a huge demand for skillsets in analog design, physical design, digital design, ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) design and ASIC verification. “Electronics engineers with these skillsets command a 20-30% premium over their software counterparts in the IT industry,” he says. Fathima Farouk, HR head for India at semiconductor company AMD, says they plan to add over 350 engineers in 2019, and there are a variety of openings, including for performance architecture, physical design, performance verification, machine learning, drivers and compiler development, and in embedded. Dasaradha Gude, whose Hyderabad-based chip design company Ineda was bought by Intel earlier this year, says China is falling out of favour globally because of issues like the trade war. So India is becoming a particularly favoured destination for chip design. “Every major semiconductor player is looking at India, which is why the number of jobs in this space, which currently stands at around 40,000, is poised to double over the next five years,” he says.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/startups/trend-tracking/ai-iot-fuel-new-chip-designs-and-india-is-at-the-centre-of-it/articleshow/69951739.cms
2019-06-22,Kotak Bank upgrades voicebot with AI capability,TNN,"MUMBAI: Kotak Mahindra Bank has upgraded its voicebot’s capabilities to include artificial intelligence (AI) based conversational banking. This has been made possible by boosting the software’s library with 1.5 lakh utterances captured over the past year. The AI capability, which was already introduced in a beta version, has increased customer fulfilment in self-service mode by more than six times. The bank is also using the library of queries it receives at the call centre to power the ‘ Keya ’ chatbot, which is available on all three platforms — net banking, mobile banking and the website. With the voicebot, customers can now complete simple transactions such as ordering a cheque book or paying bills through voice instructions. “In the first phase, the focus was on making it easier for the customer to navigate the interactive voice response system. Instead of negotiating through six levels of validation to get the requisite answer, the customer could get a response after two levels and we were able to shave off 50-56 seconds from the navigation queue,” said Kotak Mahindra Bank senior executive VP Puneet Kapoor . The new AI version autonomously fulfils customer requests without reaching out for human assistance. “In the pre-voicebot phase, only 2% of customers were concluding the request on their own and the rest were coming to the call officer to conclude their call. This has gone up to 13%,” said Kapoor. “After moving to a conversational bot, the intent recognition has gone up to 1.2 million out of an average monthly volume of 1.7 million calls,” he added. The AI-enabled chatbot is a text+voice-based bot that can answer a range of queries related to bank accounts, debit & credit cards, fund transfers, home loan, personal loan and fixed deposits. “The launch of the Keya chatbot gives our customers one more platform through which they can conveniently interact with their bank, leading to superior outcomes. Since its launch, Keya chatbot has handled over 3.5 million queries from over 1 million unique users with 93% accuracy,” said Kotak Mahindra Bank chief digital officer Deepak Sharma . In addition to responding to a customer’s query, the chatbot also provides actionable buttons that enable customers to complete the action associated with the query at that very instant.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/kotak-bank-upgrades-voicebot-with-ai-capability/articleshow/69898089.cms
2019-06-21,Artificial Intelligence courses a bigger draw for experienced techies,Swati Rathor,"The first Times Techies report that was carried on Tuesday spoke about artificial intelligence (AI) being one of the biggest opportunities today. India will need a lot more talent in the space. ""Only 1-2% of India's workforce in the tech and financial sectors have AI/ ML ( machine learning ) and data science knowledge,"" says Santanu Paul, CEO of Hyderabad-based edtech player TalentSprint, which launched an executive programme in AI/ML in association with IIIT-H last year. Top Picks For You Times Techies: Artificial intelligence has become so simple and affordable that anyone can use it LinkedIn said last year that seven out of 10 emerging jobs in India are tech-focused roles hinged on AI/ML, with ML engineer being the top job in the list. Nasscom says emerging job roles in AI include that of data architect, applied scientist, ML speech vision, analyst BI, and DevOps Engineer. Ajay Shah, head of recruitment services at HR solutions provider Teamlease, says the average hike being commanded by AI professionals while switching jobs would be 40-50%, compared to 20-30% for other skills. Paul said he is seeing more techies with 7-15 years of work experience going for the programme. ""When we started, we thought the course would get working professionals with 5-7 years of experience, as they are early in their career. But surprisingly, the average is much higher. Sometimes we think that people who will want something are the people who have the most to gain, but actually people who want something are the ones who have the most to lose. These people have resources, but also have mortgages, children in schools/colleges and cannot afford to lose the lifestyle they have built over the years,"" he says. Hari Krishnan Nair, co founder of training provider Great Learning, agrees. He says the rising interest from senior professionals looking to understand more about AI and its applications across industries has persuaded them to work on crafting a programme specifically for them. He says a lot of professionals are enrolling for such programmes because there are significant projects happening in their organisations around AI and they want to be a part of them. Another trend, Nair says, is the increase in enquiries for programmes in AI from school and college students. ""While their numbers aren't significant, they are clearly aware of AI playing a big role in their careers and want to be prepared,"" he says. V Rajanna, global head of the technology business unit in TCS , says technological advancements have historically reshaped skill requirements, but the pace at which today's next-generation technologies are developing and disrupting the global talent market is unprecedented. ""Continuous competency enhancement at scale and speed is more paramount than ever before and has become a key success factor in this digital age,"" he says.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/artificial-intelligence-courses-a-bigger-draw-for-experienced-techies/articleshow/69883603.cms
2019-06-19,India needs better math talent to lead today’s AI-driven world,Shilpa Phadnis&Sujit John,"The world’s biggest companies are coming to India for data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) skills. But renowned mathematicians believe the country needs to significantly improve its mathematics capabilities to be able to use these technologies to create really innovative and robust solutions – both for itself and the world. Manjul Bhargava, mathematics professor at Princeton University and winner of the Fields Medal, one of the highest honours in math, says India can’t hope to lead the fourth industrial revolution, “if we don’t have strong mathematical talent coming up very soon.” Srinivasa Varadhan, mathematics professor at New York University, agrees. He says if you want to provide some guarantee that a certain machine learning algorithm will work the way it’s supposed to, then you have to do the math. “Without the math, the procedures may be just experimental, may work sometimes, sometimes not. Only mathematics will tell you under what circumstances it would work,” he says. As the last issue of this page said, AI and ML have become so simple and affordable that they can today be applied in a variety of areas. To improve medical diagnosis, to create highly effective chatbots and voicebots, in automating insurance claims handling, in matchmaking. But ensuring they work effectively in all circumstances and to create more complex solutions, math is seen to be crucial. A very important application of math and machine learning in Indian cities can be to programme traffic lights and public transport systems to reduce traffic and improve traffic flows, says Bhargava. Varadhan says how well weather is predicted depends on how good the mathematical modelling of the atmosphere is. India invented the zero, but math is seen to have suffered a decline here for several reasons. The first is a global phenomenon. In the 1970s, there was a big separation between pure and applied math, says Nalini Anantharaman, chair of mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study in the University of Strasbourg, France, and last year’s winner of the Infosys Prize in Mathematics. “It wasn’t like that at the beginning of the 20th century. Now in France it’s getting better. But in India, still not quite,” she says. Bhargava describes it as a “very artificial separation,” because all pure science and math eventually get applied. A second reason for math’s decline is seen to be India’s big focus on engineering from the time of Independence. “The fact that IITs became the most prestigious place to go to put engineering on a pedestal, in a way that prevented pure science from coming up. The moment parents see their children doing well in math, they say you are going to become an engineer,” says Bhargava. Yet another mistake that happened after independence, Bhargava says, was the separation of teaching and research in India’s higher education system. India has some fantastic research institutions like Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS), Indian Statistical Institute (ISI). But they are little islands of excellence. And then there’s the whole teaching sector, state universities, where no research happens. “How can you have excellent higher education in an environment where no knowledge creation takes place! The best education happens in places that combine these, like in the Ivy Leagues, or earlier in India in Takshashila and Nalanda,” he says. The US, he says, is using its advantage in wholistic learning to develop, for instance, self-driving cars, where “we have to have computers that understand the human perspective of what they see, computer vision, that artistic, visual aspect, as well as mathematics.” In India, there’s some correction happening. A number of Indian Institutes of Science Education & Research (IISERs) – dedicated to science – have been established, and many have excellent faculty. The Chennai Mathematical Institute (CMI) has grown in stature. “It’s so good that some are turning down IITs to go there,” says Bhargava. Varadhan notes that CMI and ISI do both research and teaching. “And after all these years, IISc (Indian Institute of Science) is starting to have some undergraduate students,” he says.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/startups/trend-tracking/india-needs-better-math-talent-to-lead-todays-ai-driven-world/articleshow/69852077.cms
2019-06-18,Times Techies: Artificial intelligence has become so simple and affordable that anyone can use it,Werner Vogels,"There has never been a better time than now to develop smart applications. Users across the globe are capturing data digitally, whether this is in the physical world through sensors or GPS , or online through clickstream data. This means there is a critical mass of data available, and there is also enough affordable computing capacity in the cloud for companies and organisations of all sizes to use it effectively. Furthermore, an algorithmic revolution has taken place, because of which it is now possible to train trillions of algorithms simultaneously, making the whole machine learning process much faster. During the past 50 years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) were fields that were only accessible to an exclusive circle of researchers and scientists. That is now changing, as packages of AI and ML services, frameworks, and tools are today available to all sorts of companies and organisations, including those that don't have dedicated research groups in this field. Startups are using AI algorithms for amazing tasks, like searching for tumours in medical images, helping people learn foreign languages, or automating claims-handling at insurance companies. Entirely new categories of applications are being created, where a natural conversation between humans and machines is taking centre-stage, including building chatbots for everyday consumer requests, such as accessing the latest news updates, game scores, or weather. At Amazon , we work with billions of historical order information data, which allows us to create AI/ML-based models for many different kinds of functionalities. For example, programming interfaces that developers can use to analyse images, recognise faces and objects, or convert text to speech. Ultimately, there is something to be found for everyone who wants to define models, train them, and then scale. Matchmaking site Shaadi.com uses Amazon Rekognition, which adds image and video analysis to applications by identifying objects, people, text, scenes, and activities. Great photos are critical in helping Shaadi.com users find their right match. Amazon Rekognition helps the company quickly and affordably automate its highly complex process of identifying incorrect photos and inappropriate content.Shaadi.com estimates this has cut the team's manual work by half. One of the most advanced areas of application is e-commerce . AI supported pre-selection mechanisms help companies to remove complexity from their customers' decision-making. The more possibilities there are, the more difficult it becomes for the customer. Our best-known algorithms come from this field: filtering product suggestions based on one's purchase history of products with similar attributes, or on the behaviour of other customers who were interested in similar things. In B2B and B2C businesses, it is critical that goods are available quickly, so there are algorithms today that can predict the daily demand for goods. This is particularly complex for fashion goods, which are available in many different sizes and variations, and for which reorder possibilities are very limited. Amazon retail tackled this issue and has now made the technology available to other companies as a web service. Applied in robots, AI can free people from routine activities that are physically difficult and often stressful. For example, letting intelligent robots learn from humans how to identify the right goods, take on various orders and navigate their way autonomously through the warehouse on the most efficient route. In medicine, AI supports doctors in analysing X-ray CTs or MRT images. The World Bank uses AI to implement infrastructure programmes, development aid and other measures in a more targeted manner. What we need is a pragmatic optimistic view of the emerging possibilities. AI enables us to reduce tasks in our work where machines can do a better job than us. Not with the goal of making ourselves redundant. Rather, to refocus our skills on more meaningful tasks and projects in the workplace and for everything that we humans can do better than machines. That is what we should strive for. If we don't, we will ultimately forego the economic and societal opportunities that we could have grasped.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ai-has-become-so-simple-and-affordable-that-anyone-can-use-it/articleshow/69834351.cms

2019-06-16,Oslo firm to use AI to help architects,Bloomberg,"OSLO: A startup based in Oslo has been using artificial intelligence to try and cut down the time it takes for architects and developers to formulate new designs. Spacemaker said it had raised $25 million to develop its software and target new markets. The round was led by venture capital firm Atomico, with participation from Northzone. Danish property developer NREP, property developer OBOS, and UK real estate tech fund Round Hill Ventures also invested. “Construction is one of the least digitized industries left next to agriculture and hunting,” said Havard Haukeland, co-founder and chief executive officer of Spacemaker. The startup is built on the premise that construction is dominated by meetings rather than software. Spacemaker’s product lets architects and developers weigh various parameters, such as how much sunshine a building should get, the minimum noise allowed from passing traffic, and the number of rooms that could be fit within a plot. The software will then spit out a number of possible development layouts depending on how the inputs are weighted. Rather than the architect having to spend time consulting sound and layout specialists, Spacemaker will use publicly available data, such as congestion, to show potential design schemes in a matter of hours. Like nearly all AI startups, the company’s software is only as good as the input data, but in the Nordics, large swathes of information are publicly available. Haukeland, a former architect, said part of the capital raised will be used to obtain appropriate data sets as it expands to new markets. The number of property startups using AI has been increasing. Dutch firm Geo-Phy, backed by Index Ventures, collates satellite images, sales data and property records with crime rates, green spaces and the density of nearby independent coffee shops, to determine property valuations.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/startups/global/oslo-firm-to-use-ai-to-help-architects/articleshow/69809459.cms

Students seeking admission in IITs have several new courses to choose from after the declaration of the Joint Entrance Examination (advanced) results on Friday. For the first time, IIT-Hyderabad has introduced a BTech course in AI with an intake of 20 students. As part of the course, students will learn algorithms from the computer science department, signal processing from electrical engineering department, robotics from mechanical engineering department and mathematical foundations. “The idea is to create a complete ecosystem for AI academics and research at IIT-H,” said Prof UB Desai, director.

2019-05-24,"Artificial intelligence is the next big thing, to change world: IIITB chief",TNN,"Artificial intelligence BENGALURU: Artificial intelligence is all set to change the way one thinks and work in the coming years, says Prof S Sadagopan , director, International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore (IIITB). “Any course that a student opts for in any college is good enough as long as one learns the subject well. One needs to know something well than trying to do everything in bits. The willingness to adapt, adjust and accommodate new skills is all that a student must have,” says Sadagopan. The IIITB director will be one of the speakers at TOI’s higher education expo, Mission Admission 2019 , to be held on May 25-26. Prof Sadagopan will throw light on Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Big Data. “Engineering was unheard of centuries ago. Similarly, AI will take decades to evolve, but it will have a much larger impact. Like the way mechanical engines changed the way we work decades ago, artificial intelligence will do the same to brain power. We are entering into an era where one can have multiple careers in one generation,” Sadagopan explained. The Mission Admission expo will have 18 sessions and feature 28 speakers from different backgrounds, including civil services, science and sports. The speakers will throw light on several courses and career options for students. Chetan Kumar, actor-activist, will throw light on the opportunities in filmmaking courses after class 12. “Acting is larger than the film industry. It is theatre, street plays, puppetry, webseries and a lot more. Each requires a different approach,” Kumar said. Though Chetan says there are several possibilities for someone who wishes to enter the film industry, constant involvement in the craft of acting through ground work, studying the art and attending workshops are some small steps to become a successful actor. Chetan, who graduated from Yale University in South Asian studies with an emphasis on comparative theatre, will speak at the expo about his trajectory and process in acting as well as his journey in the film industry.

2019-05-20,"Now, AI to help government gauge crop yield",TNN,"NEW DELHI: In order to speed up claim settlement of farmers under the existing crop insurance scheme, the agriculture ministry has decided to use specialised agencies to carry out pilot studies to estimate crop yield at village/gram panchayat level using innovative technology. The move will help in quickly arriving at an “accurate” yield estimation figure. The studies will be conducted during the upcoming ‘Kharif’ (summer sown crop) season and the findings will be submitted by mid-February 2020. The technological tools to be used in estimating crop yield include high spatio-temporal remote sensing data, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle , machine learning , advanced intelligent crop simulation models and artificial intelligence . According to the ‘Expression of Interest’ issued for inviting experienced agencies for pilot studies, the ministry has initially identified eight crops — paddy, soybean , cotton , bajra, maize, sorghum, groundnut and guar. “Once the agencies come out with yield estimation figures, it will be adopted in the ‘Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana’ (PMFBY) for speedily settling claims insured farmers,” said an official. Currently, the PMFBY uses ‘crop cutting experiments’ (CCEs) to determine the yield loss suffered by farmers due to natural calamities and adverse weather conditions. The CCEs are, however, a time-consuming method which results in delay in settlement of claims. “Use of technology will speed up the entire process. The findings of the pilot projects will be assessed for taking a decision for accurate yield estimation at village/gram panchayat level,” said the official. The implementation of pilot project would be overseen by the Mahalanobis National Crop Forecast Centre (MNCFC), the agency which is currently carrying the yield estimation exercise at district level covering more than 80% of the agriculture area in the country.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/now-ai-to-help-government-gauge-crop-yield/articleshow/69404589.cms
2019-05-19,Govt plans introducing artificial intelligence system in MCA 21 portal,PTI,"New Delhi, May 19 () Corporate affairs ministry plans to introduce artificial intelligence system in the MCA 21 portal as it seeks to make compliance process easier as well as ensure routine enforcement activities are done round-the-clock on autopilot basis. MCA 21 is the electronic backbone for dissemination of information to all stakeholders, including the regulator, corporates and investors. All filings under the companies law are submitted to the ministry through this portal. Corporate Affairs Secretary Injeti Srinivas has said the ministry would look to ""introduce Artificial Intelligence in MCA 21 when version 3 of the portal is rolled out in about a year's time"". ""It will look to rationalise all the forms, follow the principle of single source of truth so that one is not required to fill in known details again (as it will get filled automatically) and also interlink databases, so that routine enforcement is done 24x7 on autopilot basis,"" he said. In the ministry's monthly newsletter, Srinivas also said that MCA 21 allows electronic filings of various documents under Companies Act, 2013 and has fully automated all processes related to enforcement and compliance monitoring under the Act. Earlier this year, the ministry sought applications from service providers to develop as well as operate the upgraded version of MCA 21 system. MCA 21 system was started in 2006. The first phase of the e-governance initiative of the ministry was implemented by Tata Consultancy Services and the second phase is being implemented by Infosys for the period from January 2013-July 2021.

2019-05-15,IIT-Madras develops AI-powered drones for rescue operations,U Tejonmayam,"Indian Institute of Technology Madras In December 2015, when fishermen took their boats on to flood ravaged streets of Chennai to rescue those stranded, the city police deployed a drone fitted with a camera in several inaccessible neighbourhoods and rescued more than 200 people after images captured by the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were processed in a control room. Now, a team from Centre for Innovation, Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT-M), has designed and developed a 3D printed drone that can fly, automatically detect human being and recognize indviduals in need of immediate medical care in a disaster affected site before it sends the location details to the ground station in real time for rescue operations . For this, the team has equipped the drone, its components including cameras and the ground station servers with artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning and computer vision skills. While the drone is powered by artificial intelligence, the camera is programmed with face and activity recognition software to quickly identify people injured, stranded or covered in debris, and waiting to be rescued. “The lack of resources and the time required to scan all locations after any disaster are limitations faced by rescue teams deployed by the armed forces or local authorities. We are trying to address these issues with artificial intelligence and computer vision,” said Pranav Pawar, who was initially part of the team. According to the team members, the camera attached to the drone, a hexacopter, is programmed with an algorithm that can detect people and send the GPS location along with images and videos of the spot to the ground station. The camera can identify the existence of people in a location from a maximum height of about 30m. “Ground level object detection can also be done to confirm that people are actually there by manoeuvring the drone lower,” Pawar said. As the camera detects, it sends the images or videos to a processor in the drone to process the data before it is transmitted to the ground station along with location details. The members said that besides face recognition, the cameras are also programmed with activity recognition system to identify people who need to be rescued first and given immediate medical care. “This way, we can prioritize the rescue mission,” the team said. While the drone is 3D printed at the IIT-M lab, components like camera, processor and gimbal — used to stabilize the camera during drone movement — are bought and attached. “We are now optimizing the drone with obstacle avoidance system to make it autonomous,” they said. Ayush Maniar, another team member, said he is now representing the team at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, US, after winning the Codefundo++ National Challenge, organized by Microsoft India that encouraged students to developed AI-powered drones. “We also demonstrated the drone in the technology seminar conducted by the Indian Army in January this year. We hope to soon demonstrate our technology with the NDRF,” he said. Prof K Senthil Kumar of department of aerospace engineering from Madras Institute of Technology, Chennai, who has developed drones which are now being used by the Tamil Nadu police, said, “Drones being used now by police for surveillance are not equipped with cameras using activity and face recognition technology, but implementing such technology in the field may, however, be challenging.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/iit-m-develops-ai-powered-drones-for-rescue-operations/articleshow/69332813.cms
2019-05-10,"Now, Artificial Intelligence creates fashion models",Business Insider,"The same kind of AI technology that has wowed the internet with computer-generated cats, faces, and Airbnb listings has now been used to create completely fake fashion models. Japanese tech company Data-Grid made the AI using a Generative Adversarial Network (or GAN). GANs work by essentially pitting two algorithms against each other, with one trying to generate fake images and another trying to spot that they’re fake. GANs have come into the public eye partially because they’re popular in “deep fake” technology, which has produced eerily convincing videos transplanting one person’s face onto another. DataGrid released a video showing off the technology, showing a multitude of generated models. Although looking very closely at the model’s faces might tip you off that they’re not real, the results are spookily realistic. DataGrid said in a press release it wants next to generate models capable of movement. “We will further improve the accuracy of the whole-body model automatic generation AI and research and develop the motion generation AI. In addition, we will conduct demonstration experiments with advertising and apparel companies to develop functions required for actual operation,” said DataGrid, as reported by Dazed. DataGrid presented this demo without many details, but noted that its tech could find use in creating virtual models for advertising and displaying apparel. If it’s widely adopted, it could reduce the need for brands and online stores to invest in photo shoots to showcase their products. The company previously developed an AI to spit out images resembling Japanese celebrities using GANs. When you feed them a large amount of data, they can learn from it to create content similar to what it saw. The technique was developed in 2014, and it’s come a long way since then",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/now-artificial-intelligence-creates-fashion-models/articleshow/69261490.cms

2019-05-07,A trader’s dilemma: Who to sue when a robot loses millions?,Bloomberg,"NEW DELHI: Robots are getting more humanoid every day, but they still can't be sued. So a Hong Kong tycoon is doing the next best thing. He's going after the salesman who persuaded him to entrust a chunk of his fortune to the supercomputer whose trades cost him more than $20 million. The case pits Samathur Li Kin-kan, whose father is a major investor in Shaftesbury, which owns property in London , against Raffaele Costa, who has spent much of his career selling investment funds. It's the first-known instance of humans going to court over investment losses triggered by a robot and throws the spotlight on the ""black box"" problem: If people don't know how the computer is making decisions, who's responsible when things go wrong? ""People tend to assume that algorithms are faster and better decision-makers than human traders,""said Mark Lemley, a law professor at Stanford University . ""That may often be true, but when it's not, or when they quickly go astray, investors want someone to blame."" It all started in March 2017 when 45-year-old Li, first met Costa, the 49-ye ar-old Italian who's often known by peers in the industry as ""Captain Magic."" Costa described a robot hedge fund his company, London-based Tyndaris, would soon offer to manage money entirely using artificial intelligence (AI). Developed by Austria-based company 42.cx, the supercomputer named K1 would comb through real-time news and social media to gauge investor sentiment and make predictions on US stock futures. It would then send instructions to a broker to execute trades, adjusting its strategy as it learned more. Costa shared simulations with Li showing K1 making double-digit returns, although the two now dispute the thoroughness of the back-testing. Li eventually let K1 manage $2.5 billion - $250 million of his own cash and the rest leverage from Citigroup. The plan was to double that over time. But Li became unhappy with K1 almost as soon as the computer started trading in late 2017. By February 2018, it was regularly losing money, including over $20 million in a single day, which Li's lawyers argue wouldn't have happened if K1 was as sophisticated as Costa led him to believe. Li is now suing Tyndaris for about $23 million for allegedly exaggerating what K1 could do. Lawyers for Tyndaris, which is suing Li for $3 million in unpaid fees, deny that Costa overplayed K1's capabilities. They say he was never guaranteed the AI strategy would make money. The legal battle is a sign of what's in store as AI is incorporated into all facets of life, from self-driving cars to virtual assistants. When the technology misfires, where the blame lies is open to interpretation. And it could get worse when AI begins selling products to customers. Even suing the salesperson may not be possible.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/a-traders-dilemma-who-to-sue-when-a-robot-loses-millions/articleshow/69209830.cms

In fact, they are now the buzzwords in the tech industry. A report from global tech firm Intel says around 70% of Indian firms expect to deploy AI-related solutions by mid-2019. At the same time, more than three-fourth of the companies feel they will face a shortage of skilled workforce when they implement these new technologies, which is an opportunity for students. Prof S Sadagopan, director, International Institute of Information Technology-Bangalore (IIIT-B), says it all boils down to the basics. While these terms look suave and sophisticated, the changes can be attributed to two things: Faster processing power and increased connectivity. ""These tools give us the ability to more data analysis, while students' efforts should be concentrated on gathering insights,"" he said. On the collaboration between industry and academia on the development of latest technologies, he said the synergies are definitely there. ""But academics have a more long-term vision, whereas the industry is forced to look into the needs of the immediate future."" Sadagopan will interact with students and parents in a session, 'The hottest courses for the coolest tech jobs,' on May 18 at Mission Admission 2019.

The students who want to get placed in IT companies need to clear artificial-intelligence based auto-proctoring tests in the future. The test, which will gain prominence in future recruitment drives, was conducted for the first time by Cognizant along with Anna University in January. “So far, auto-proctoring test was only used by IT product companies for jobs with higher packages. Now, Cognizant has successfully used it for mass recruitment. We expect all the IT service companies to follow suit,” said T Kalaiselvan, additional director, Centre for University-Industry Collaboration (CUIC), Anna University. “The entire process went without any glitch. Only 22 of 10,017 students who took the test were disqualified for violations, which shows that the students have adapted to the new test,” Kalaiselvan added. Companies like TCS are already conducting national level tests for recruitment. “The competition will be a national level. But, students from rural areas and those with limitations in language skills will also get an opportunity with this test. But they still have to clear the interview to get job offers,” a principal said. “The web-based test will help complete the recruitment process within a month compared to the three or four months it takes in a conventional way.

2019-04-30,AI and IoT are now taking over our lives. Are we over-dependent on them?,TNN,"Technology is the fastest growing man-made phenomenon, which affects almost all the world's population. From urban cities to rural villages, you are likely to find gadgets and gizmos in every space. The next step is Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the use of Internet of Things (IoT) — internet and connectivity in everyday objects. Like the growth of technology, AI is also growing rapidly, and a growing number of people are relying on it in their daily life. From using it to navigate, to controlling the temperature at houses, AI is making its presence known. What is the Internet of Things? The Internet of Things (IoT) is an extension of the internet into everyday objects. It runs lights, fans, geysers, robots, doorbells, etc., by being connected to the internet and is controlled by the internet. IoT allows a person to set their lights to a desirable colour or get their robot to clean at a specific time with the use of the internet on their smartphones, computers or tablets. Internet of things at home These days, you can use smartphones to tell a robot back home to dust and mop the floor by the time you reach back in the evening. And it doesn’t stop there, smart homes are fast becoming a reality. Fans, lights, doorbells, refrigerators, microwaves and security systems are all being made to be controlled by smartphones. But this is not just about luxury living. Vinay Mullapudi, a software marketing engineer, says, “The IoT and gadgets that use AI have never been a luxury for me. My mother's illness and my allergies to micro dust particles made it a necessity to use robots and connect smart devices around my house. No human being can clean micro particles that float around the house, but robots are capable of doing that. I have even installed air purifiers and programmed them to feel the climate and change accordingly.” Vinay adds that he can also connect all the robots around his house, so once the robot has finished cleaning and mopping, the air purifiers can start their work. “I don’t think that it’s a bad thing to be dependent on IoT or AI, because they are capable of doing much more than a human being can do. For me, technology is a tool that helps make life easier.” Using personal assistants for daily tasks For some people, it’s all about making life just that much better and having lesser things to juggle. Personal assistants and IoT can carry out the mundane tasks that we may not have time to do, which is why actress Meghana Gaonkar prefers using them. “All these devices add to the lives of people, especially lazy people like me. When I’m rushing to go somewhere or have my hands full, I can ask my AI assistant to play music or something like that. I don't think that I am completely dependent on these gadgets, however, they do help remind me to exercise when I'm sitting for too long, and other little things like that,’’ she says. Are we becoming too dependent on AI? The dependency on AI is a growing phenomenon that is spreading throughout the world. It shows itself in small ways and expands to bigger things. By not wearing a watch, we depend on our phones to tell us the time. And we feed into this dependency when we ask Siri to call a contact. But AI is not evil; it is, after all, being developed to make our lives easier. It’s the dependence we have in AI that becomes the problem, and studies have shown that more of us are doing this. A common example of over dependency on AI is the use of map apps. A huge percentage of people in urban areas use map apps to commute, but in case the route is misleading, several people have found themselves stranded, without literally knowing which way to turn. AI doesn’t mean forgetting our own capabilities This is why it is important for us to always fall back on our natural abilities. AI allows us to do countless things already, and it will only grow to do more. But we have to keep in mind that AI does not mean forgetting our own capabilities, but using our capabilities and enhancing them with AI.

2019-04-28,Adobe bets on AI to change customer interactions,Sajeev Kumarapuram,"Once the realm of science fiction, AI is transforming how big and small businesses around the world operate. At the annual Adobe Summit in Las Vegas, tech head honchos reiterated one important thing: AI will amplify human productivity, not replace humans. “Nahi suna hai saab, woh AI kya hai,"" Jaswant admits to not having heard of artificial intelligence, as he loosens the lug nuts of a flat tyre with greasy hands. It's a sweltering day in Noida, and a busy highway is not the ideal place to spend a Monday morning ruing over a puncture. And you probably won’t, a few years from now. Standing next to another car, or at least a model of it, a young, software consultant from Bangalore is holding a phone and the gazes of some 17,000 people attending the annual Adobe Summit at Las Vegas, US. “This app shows real-time information regarding the fuel that you've consumed, the running cost, and even the number of times you've overshot the RPM,” said Deepthi Amirthagadeswaran, part of the team that developed Car Smarts , a potential future tech at Adobe. The cloud-based app prototype can map car health information, predict breakdowns, and recommend service requirements; and the data will be available to both consumers and manufacturers for analysis and optimisation. That means before the battery is down, or a tyre is flat, your car manufacturer will give you a call and extend a helping hand. Well in advance, thanks to AI. AI is going from the pages of science fiction to a real role in our daily lives, courtesy smartphones, smart home devices, social media, and media streaming services. It is also finding use in every kind of business, be it healthcare, retail, data security, security and surveillance, manufacturing, banking and finance, and even adding a personal touch to customer interactions worldwide. Adobe, the California-based company best known for Photoshop and Acrobat, recently unveiled its next-generation Sensei, which makes AI and machine learning capabilities widely accessible to any business, including to those that lack or only have limited data science resources. Its Experience Platform stitches together data from across the entire enterprise to deliver personalised experiences in real time. “Every business has to transform itself to be maniacally focused on the customer experience,” said Shantanu Narayen , Adobe Chairman and CEO, in his opening keynote at the world’s largest customer experience conference. “The trick is to know every customer as if they are your only customer. This takes data and intelligence.” “Building a great experience sounds like a simple idea, but delivering it is so much harder. The challenge we have are that the legacy systems most enterprises rely on can’t keep up with these high customer expectations for personalisation,” Narayen added. Breaking the Data Silos “The greatest asset and most important asset everyone in this room has is data, which is yours. Except it’s often locked up in silos,” said Satya Nadella , Microsoft CEO, at the recent summit. Last September, Adobe, Microsoft, and SAP had joined hands for an open data initiative to connect data and gather insights fuelled by AI. “The partnership was to unlock this data and help each of you enrich it… It’s not about our customers being dependent on us -- it’s about us enabling customers to build their own independence with us,” Nadella said. Based on PwC research, 72% of business leaders believe AI provides a market advantage. Adobe data reveals top-performing companies are twice as likely to harness this technology for marketing than their lower-ranked peers. Automation of data analysis and research reports ranks high among areas where AI is expected to make the biggest impact. Shantanu Narayen with Satya Nadella Will algorithms replace you? Judith Donath, author of The Social Machine, Designs for Living Online and faculty fellow at Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, writes: “By 2030, most social situations will be facilitated by bots – intelligent-seeming programs that interact with us in human-like ways. At home, parents will engage skilled bots to help kids with homework and catalyse dinner conversations. At work, bots will run meetings. A bot confidant will be considered essential for psychological wellbeing, and we’ll increasingly turn to such companions for advice ranging from what to wear to whom to marry.” The early rumblings of AI as a true change agent are already being felt – be it Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, Amazon’s Alexa, or personalised Google suggestions and Facebook ads. Some people are eager to adopt and integrate the new tools and ways of working AI makes possible; others are wary and even oppose the likely changes. The great fear about cognitive technologies is that they will put masses of people out of work. As smart machines take over certain tasks traditionally done by humans, some job loss is likely. But cognitive systems perform tasks, not entire jobs. Business drudgery in every industry and function—overseeing routine transactions, repeatedly answering the same questions, and extracting data from endless documents—could become the province of machines, freeing up human workers to be more productive and creative. Sensei is only taking care of mundane and repetitive tasks so that marketers and practitioners can focus on the more creative storytelling and high-value activities, Narayen said. “It will only amplify human productivity, not replace humans.” So instead of losing jobs, Jaswant and his ilk will soon have one advantage: they’ll know in advance when to prep the wrench and spanners.

2019-04-22,Conversational AI goes mainstream now,Sindhu Hariharan,"CHENNAI: 2019 is on the path to be an inflection point for conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) as the technology moves from being considered to be a futuristic novelty to a value-add for enterprise marketing. As businesses embrace real-world applications of AI-based chatbots and voice-powered assistants, investments and acquisition action in the space has seen an uptick this year. Data from Tracxn shows 2019 has already clocked deals valued at over $6 million in the segment till date, compared to $13 million investments raised by startups in 2018, across 11 deals. Frontdesk.ai, an AI assistant for the health and wellness segment, raised $2 million in a pre-Series A funding round led by pi Ventures, and AI-led conversational customer engagement platform Yellow Messenger raised $4 million last month in Series A from undisclosed investors. Voice interactions, chatbots, AI-supported human concierges, and digital assistants largely make up the conversational AI market in India. While such solutions are gaining rapid adoption in financial services for sales and service needs, industries like hospitality and travel are also embracing conversational AI to keep consumers engaged and satisfied. Conversational analytics is another growing segment, where companies evaluate service levels by reading into consumer sentiment using AI. 2019 also saw two major startup acquisitions in the segment in a span of two weeks. Haptik was acquired by Reliance Industries (by subsidiary Rel Jio) in a deal worth Rs 700 crore (including primary capital investment) earlier this month. The acquisition is being touted as Reliance’s move to rival Amazon’s Alexa and will give Jio an opportunity to leverage Haptik’s tech in building consumer solutions. Marketing automation platform Netcore Solutions acquired Quinto.ai last week, securing access to startup’s AI engine and talent. Veer Chand Bothra, chief entrepreneur and evangelist, Netcore says the conversational AI market is in a “close to maturity” stage in India, and adoption by conventional sectors has “truly taken off ” in the past two years. “More acquisitions and tech partnerships will help this form of AI become mainstream in the next couple of years,” he said. Uniphore, a Chennaiborn AI enterprise backed by Cisco’s John Chambers, is among few Indian AI players to taste global success. “We are seeing real use cases and adoption both in India and in other global markets we serve. In the customer service domain, conversational AI is becoming a mainstream platform to deliver differentiated CX,” Samith Ramachandran, VP and head of products, Uniphore, said. Ramachandran expects to see more investments and corporate-startup partnerships as organisations strive to master customer service and experience. Deep tech investor and pi Ventures founding partner Manish Singhal is bullish on the space and judges conversational AI by its use. “The ‘human + AI’ model is interesting when it has deep problem-solving abilities, and we look out for such specific and deep uses of conversational AI.” D D Mishra, senior director analyst, Gartner, notes that over 40% of Indian entities have either adopted or are in the process of adopting conversational platforms. “Culture often stands as a barrier; procurement departments in India are driven by traditional mindset of headcount, which goes against automation and revolves around creating efficiencies,” he added.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/conversational-ai-goes-mainstream-now/articleshow/68983524.cms
2019-04-21,"Now, artificial intelligence to enhance safety in petrol pumps",Binu Karunakaran,"KOCHI: Don't be surprized if you receive personalized offers based on your vehicle profile, the next time you pull into an Indian Oil petrol pump. Neuroplex, a startup that emerged from Future Technologies Lab an initiative by Kerala Startup Mission has signed an agreement with Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) to use artificial intelligence (AI) to qualitatively improve customer interaction and safety in their petrol pumps across the country. Their signature product 'Eyes Age' uses deep learning to empower video surveillance with AI capabilities. It creates visual relationships between objects in the video which allows for a logical analysis of video data. ""The system can identify customers by analysing the number plate of the vehicle and give them unique offers,"" said Keerthi, a developer with Neuroplex. The AI-powered video content analysis modules developed by Neuroplex can enhance security in petrol pumps, which has to follow several protocols to avoid fire hazard. Petrol pumps would be able to manage entry and exit of vehicles using automatic number plate recognition (ANPR), keep count of attendees at venues and send out alerts in the event of protocol violations like use of mobile phones. The startup co-founded by two youngsters from Thiruvananthapuram was shortlisted from 1,300 applications under the business process re-engineering (BPRE) category of the Indian Oil Open Innovation Challenge held in August last year. Initially, the Indian Oil is planning to install the system in 20 pumps in a span of 12 months. ""It is an honour to be part of the Indian Oil's journey into digital transformation of retail outlets. We believe this project will act as a catalyst to this transformation,"" said co-founder of Neuroplex Savio Victor. The agreement with IOC was signed on April 18 at Indian Oil R&D Centre, Faridabad .",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/now-artificial-intelligence-to-enhance-safety-in-petrol-pumps/articleshow/68973217.cms
2019-04-17,CBSE plans artificial intelligence course in Class IX syllabus,TNN,"Ranchi: The Central Board of Secondary Education ( CBSE ) is set to introduce new optional subjects for the students of upcoming batch from Class 9 onwards which will include courses on Artificial Intelligence , early childhood care and yoga . Students have been advised to choose any one of these three subjects as their optional paper as per their interests. Abhishek Reddy, a student of JVM Shyamli said, “The course on Artificial Intelligence is going to be extremely helpful for students like me who are interested in pursuing engineering.” Educationists believe that to keep pace with changing times, the students’ curriculum should also be redesigned. Anant Kumar, professor of social science at Xavier Institute of Social Services (XISS), said, “This is a marvellous initiative, which, in the long run will help students who want to pursue a career in the field of information technology.” He added,“With the upswing in the number of teenage depression cases, introduction of subjects like yoga and early childhood care is a wise decision and must be made mandatory in all schools in order to help children lead a healthy life.” Unfortunately, there are a few schools in the city which are not adequately prepared for the introduction of these new subjects. Ranchi Ram Singh, DPS principal, said, “ How we can we start teaching these subjects if the CBSE itself has not prescribed any books on them.” However, Bridgford school, Ranchi, has flat-out refused the idea of introducing the new optional subjects with principal Seema Chitlangia stating that the school does not plan to include Artificial Intelligence as a subject in the near future. On the other hand, DPS Greater Ranchi is already prepared for the subjects’ introduction even before the CBSE’s notification. Rajesh Shrivastava, director, said, “We were already prepared for the subjects’ launch even before the CBSE notification. We have also included machine language and ethical hacking courses through our cyber range. Also, from May 1 we will open our cyber forensic laboratory for students of other schools, engineering colleges as well as institutions”.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cbse-plans-artificial-intelligence-course-in-class-ix-syllabus/articleshow/68912286.cms
2019-03-31,Chunar stn first to get AI software for rly track safety,tnn,"Allahabad: Months after the unmanned crossing along Chunar Chopan section of Allahabad division of North Central Railway (NCR) became the last to be eliminated in the nation, Chunar railway station became the first in the country where the ‘ Hanging Part Detection System’ (HDPS) was installed. Comprising an extremely sensitive camera with an artificial intelligence-based software, the system detects any object found to be hanging 155 millimetre above the railway track and avert accidents like derailment. The system is so designed that it can detect any object hanging from a wagon running at a speed of 130 km/hour, the maximum permissible speed for trains running in Allahabad division including India’s fastest train Vande Bharat Express. Public relation officer of NCR’s Allahabad division, SK Gupta, said, “Among several features, this system alerts officials when a hanging part is detected. Any object detected above up to 155mm of the railway track will be treated as a hanging object except the wheel.” The HDPS system was installed along the yard at Chunar railway station in November, 2018 by senior divisional mechanical engineer Ajit Kumar Singh and his team. However, the authorities started recording the system’s performance only from March 15. Gupta said that on March 18, the system had sent out alerts although it was later found that the hanging object was actually a plastic bottle. “If the system detects any object hanging it sends out alerts to a number of officials through SMS. After receiving the SMS, the authorities can check the report generated by HDPS for any unusual readings. These readings also include data like temperature of the wheel and axle (as it is integrated with existing hot box detector), speed of the train and number of wagons,” said Gupta. The hot box detection system records the temperature of the wheel and the axle of the train. Moreover, the HPDS collects images of the tracks, performs an imaging analysis and sets a continuous communication with controller of hot box detection system. After receiving the alert, NCR officials would be able to access the recorded video feed of the railway track.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/chunar-stn-first-to-get-ai-software-for-rly-track-safety/articleshow/68651116.cms
2019-03-31,"'Hindu epics are full of AI, robots. Legend has it that they guarded Buddha’s relics'",Manimugdha S Sharma,"A research scholar at Stanford University, Adrienne Mayor is a historian of ancient science and also a folklorist. In her latest book, Gods and Robots: Myths, Machines, and Ancient Dreams of Technology, she explores how ancient cultures imagined futuristic technologies and left behind those imaginations in epics and scriptures. She tells Sunday Times how Ashoka battled robots, and other tech tales from the past. There is a belief in India among Hindutva circles that ancient Indians had invented everything from spacecraft to missiles to the Internet. How do you see all this with your research? My research into the first inklings of the scientific impulse took me into the world of mythology, where ancient people first envisioned making artificial life, automatons (or robots), self-moving devices, and other marvellous things long before the technology made them possible. These stories about robots and other machines in ancient oral traditions were first written down in the time of Homer, about 2,700 years ago. But the Greeks were not the only people to imagine automatons and machines in antiquity. Similar stories exist in the Ramayana, Mahabharata , and other epics. In Hindu myths, automatons are made by the engineer god Vishwakarma and the sorceress Maya; in Greek myths they are made by the god of technology Hephaestus and the brilliant artisan Daedalus. I consider such myths to be the world’s first science fiction stories. No single civilisation had a monopoly on ancient dreams of advanced technology. Whether one looks at Greek, Etruscan, Egyptian, Hindu, Islamic, Chinese, or any other ancient cultural myths about artificial life, they all contemplate what wonders might be achieved if only one could possess the divine creativity and abilities of the gods. But it’s not possible to draw a direct line of development from mythology over millennia to modern scientific knowledge. You say that Indian and Hellenistic cultures borrowed from each other when it came to imagining technologies. How? Indian and Hellenistic cultures borrowed and influenced each other beginning in about the fifth century BC, and syncretism intensified after Alexander of Macedon and King Porus began relations in the fourth century BC. Jain texts mention that Ajatasatru’s engineers invented armoured war chariots with spinning blades, which may have inspired later Persian scythed chariots, and he had powerful machines to hurl massive boulders before Philip II of Macedon obtained torsion catapults. India was known for perpetually burning oil lamps, suggesting knowledge of naphtha, unknown to the Greeks and Romans until much later. The travelling Greek sage Apollodorus of Tyana observed automated servants and self-propelled carts in the court of a ruler of India, and India was centuries ahead of Europe in the technologies of distillation and hydraulics. There was probably more give and take than we can know. Which other cultures have their own cosmic weapons, robots and flying chariots? Myths featuring flying chariots and synthetic swans, animated servants, giant robots, machines, and the like appear in the Mahabharata, Ramayana, Kathasaritsagara, Harivamsa, and other works. Self-navigating ships appear in Egyptian texts and Homer’s Odyssey; android and animal automatons are described in Homer’s Iliad and in Chinese chronicles. Further examples are myriad. Please share the story of android warriors guarding Buddha’s relics. The most detailed account is in the Lokapanatti, a complicated compilation of tales from Burma. After Buddha’s death, the story recounts that King Ajatasatru preserved his bodily remains in a hidden chamber under a stupa. The precious relics were guarded by bhuta vahana yantra (spirit movement machines). These were robotic warriors with whirling swords — reminiscent of the king’s novel war machines with spinning blades. Greek myths tell of automaton guardians in human and animal form defending palaces and treasure, but the historical and technological details of this legend make it unique. The story says the robots were constructed from plans secretly transported to Pataliputra from Roma-visaya, the Greek-influenced West, by a yantrakara, a robot maker who was originally from Pataliputra. The automaton soldiers guarded Buddha’s relics until the great Indian emperor Ashoka heard about the secret chamber. Ashoka battled the robots and after he defeated and learned how to control them, they obeyed him. Historically, we know that Ashoka did unearth and distribute long-hidden relics of Buddha across the land. Did anyone in ancient times build any automatons as imagined in the scriptures? By third century BC, craftspeople and engineers in the Greek world, Alexandria , Arabia, India and China began making self-moving devices, flying bird models, animated machines, and automatons like those described in myths. Some were miniature and some monumental, some had simple mechanisms and some were quite complex. These contrivances were powered by springs, levers, pulleys, water, air, heat, and so on.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/hindu-epics-are-full-of-ai-robots-legend-has-it-that-they-guarded-buddhas-relics/articleshow/68648962.cms
2019-03-28,"Liberal arts, humanities shine in the age of AI",Sindhu Hariharan,"CHENNAI: If you had taken the humanities route to stay away from the tech world, get ready to head down the latter path. The growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has opened up opportunities in the tech industry for those from liberal arts , humanities, and related areas, as companies strive to make their AI and chatbots as human as possible. Globally, Microsoft has an entire ‘content experiences’ team designing a personality for its virtual assistant Cortana, with Hollywood screenwriter Jonathan Foster heading the effort. Foster told TOI that liberal arts is a key requirement for the team, and not just a nice-to-have. “It’s a mindset, not a checklist box, and technology needs a lot more of that,” he said. Indian conversational AI startups TOI spoke to said it takes more than just tech prowess to enable human-machine interactions, and thus almost 10% of their core team consists of creatives and humanities specialists. Mumbai-based Haptik, one of the earliest conversational AI platforms, hires content writers, creatives and linguists to complement its tech team. “We have a team of around five conversational UI specialists augmenting our bots with understanding of human conversations, and we also just hired a psychology professional,” says Aakrit Vaish, co-founder and CEO, Haptik, noting plans to ramp up such talent. AI and big data firm Crayon Data currently has close to 10-15% of its core team coming from liberal arts and humanities backgrounds. “Few of our key resources and front line managers have a background in humanities. We are looking at a 25% growth in hiring individuals from these streams, in the next two years,” Aarti Ramakrishnan, director and CMO, Crayon Data, said. Pune’s Light Information Systems, a maker of enterprise NLP (natural language processing) bots, works with consultants in the field of psychology, sociology and linguistics to help craft most appropriate bot responses for human queries. Gartner’s VP analyst Arup Roy says knowledge of semantics and sentiment analysis is critical for companies working on AI and voice-based virtual assistants. “There is a need to pair engineering talent with skillsets around humanities and sociology, and this will require a culture change on the part of Indian enterprises, who are used to hiring tech minds,” Roy said. Industry insiders say Google and Amazon, two other global leaders in the space, also rely on a global team of creatives to power their virtual assistants Google Assistant and Alexa. Google did not share details of this team, but Arpita Kumar, South Asia lead, Google Assistant Personality, said they focus on ensuring the AI interactions are “conversational, culturally relevant, and linguistically accurate.” Educational institutions in the humanities realm also note increased industry-academia interaction in recent times, a rarity in the field. IIT-Madras’ humanities department is in final stages of collaborating with tech giant TCS for memory studies, and expects this to open up internships and employment opportunities for their students. For Deborah Harrison, an architect of Microsoft Cortana’s personality, this trend is a major opportunity for those pursuing liberal arts. “For me, the tech world was an opportunity to be paid to write, which was a completely unexpected turn of events for someone who’d recently gathered a liberal arts degree,” she said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/liberal-arts-humanities-shine-in-the-age-of-ai/articleshow/68604955.cms
2019-03-24,"IISc Open Day: Lightning simulation, AI-powered robot catch eye",TNN,"Bengaluru: From learning about 79-million-year-old Cretaceous fossils to understanding how rockets work, a host of models, lecture topics, posters and demonstrations marked the 2019 Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Open Day. Among the plethora of things that caught the eye were the lightning simulation and ‘Stoch’. The lightning simulation demonstrated how to create lightning (the lab is charged with high voltage and currents), while researchers also explained various scientific details like why lightning does not affect people travelling by a plane. ‘Stoch’, an artificial intelligence-powered robot drew the young and old alike. While the machine itself can walk on different terrains, the team’s primary goal is to learn deep-reinforcement learning algorithms that can help develop robots of future with specific walking behaviours. The team comprised Bharadwaj Amrutur, Shalabh Bhatnagar, Ashitava Ghosal and Shishir Kolathaya. Further, from explaining the Coanda effect — tendency of fluids to follow, in certain conditions, curved profiles — to showcasing various uses of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), there was plenty for students and other science buffs to explore. Prof Y Narahari, chairman, IISc Open Day , said: “An event like this allows our students to showcase their work to outsiders and also helps generate interest in science among visiting students.” If rocket demonstrations enthralled children, adult science buffs were found engrossed in lectures. For Dyuthi R Raju from Baldwin’s Girls High School, the priority was to see a rocket demonstration. While Dyuthi, who will be soon be going to class 4, was too shy to speak, her mother, Soumya Nandaraju, said: “She has always been fascinated by rockets. When she was younger she had made a paper rocket and named it Gowri.” Soumya, an engineer herself, did her project work at IISc, although she studied elsewhere. “As a teacher I’d tell my students to visit IISc. During our college days, entering the institute and accessing its library was easy. All you needed was a student ID,” she said. Among the highlights of the day was ‘Roshni’, a workshop which helped kids learn about creating effects of lighting using ‘end of life’ material and low-cost simple solution to overcome harmful radiation from commercial LEDs. Sai Smaran, a fourth semester engineering student from PES College, said: “While we do a lot of practical stuff ourselves, coming here gives us a first-hand understanding of several new research projects, while also exposing us to newer techniques.” Some interesting projects • Drone for farmers • Smart stick for the visually impaired • Voice-controlled vehicle • Floating waste cleaner * Fireworks ignited by ice",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/iisc-open-day-lightning-simulation-ai-powered-robot-catch-eye/articleshow/68541556.cms
2019-03-22,Google celebrates Johann Sebastian Bach's birth anniversary with first ever AI-powered doodle,TIMESOFINDIA.COM,"NEW DELHI: Google Doodle on Friday celebrated the birth anniversary of renowned German composer and musician Johann Sebastian Bach with its first ever AI-powered doodle. Bach was born in a small German town of Eisenach in 1685. He grew up in a large musical family: his father played multiple instruments and also worked as director of the town’s musicians. His eldest brother, also a musician, raised young Bach from the age of 10 after his father’s passing. Primarily known as an exceptional organist during his lifetime, Bach also understood how to build and repair the complex inner mechanisms of pipe organs (which are depicted in today’s interactive Doodle). Bach could compose music at a prolific pace (sometimes at the rate of one cantata per week!). Google Doodle in its note on Bach said,""He was a humble man who attributed his success to divine inspiration and a strict work ethic. He lived to see only a handful of his works published, but more than 1,000 that survived in manuscript form are now published and performed all over the world."" Bach’s reputation soared following the 19th century “Bach revival,” as the music world gained new appreciation for his innovative use of four-part harmony. But musicians weren’t the only ones affected by Bach’s music. After the Voyager 2 deep space probe launched, scientist and author Lewis Thomas suggested that the human race broadcast its music to the outermost reaches of the solar system. “I would vote for Bach, all of Bach,” he wrote. “We would be bragging, of course.” Explaining the first ever AI-powered doodle, Google said that it made it in partnership with the Google Magenta and Google PAIR teams. The Doodle gives an interactive experience encouraging players to compose a two measure melody of their choice. With the press of a button, the Doodle then uses machine learning to harmonize the custom melody into Bach’s signature music style. Machine learning is the process of teaching a computer to come up with its own answers by showing it a lot of examples, instead of giving it a set of rules to follow as is done in traditional computer programming. Today's model behind the Google Doodle was trained on 306 of Bach’s chorale harmonizations to harmonize the custom melody that users create. In another Doodle first, the Doodle is also served with Google’s new Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), a way of quickly handling machine learning tasks in data centers. The doodle facilitates machine learning within a web browser. Generally such applications run utilizing tons of servers, as machine learning traditionally does.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/google-doodle-celebrates-bach-birth-anniversary-with-first-ever-ai-powered-doodle/articleshow/68515963.cms

Today's doodle is an interactive experience which is encouraging users to compose their own notes and create a melody of their choice. In order to create your own melody, you have to click on the play button placed on the doodle. After this with the help of machine learning you marked notes will be harmonised with the melody of Bach's signature music style and your own melody will be created. The model used in today's Doodle was developed by Magenta Team AI Resident Anna Huang, who developed Coconet: a versatile model that can be used in a wide range of musical tasks—such as harmonizing melodies or composing from scratch. Specifically, Coconet was trained on 306 of Bach’s chorale harmonizations. His chorales always have four voices, each carrying their own melodic line, while creating a rich harmonic progression when played together. This concise structure made them good training data for a machine learning model. Bach is known for his instrumental compositions such as the Art of Fugue, the Brandenburg Concertos, and the Goldberg Variations. Born in 1685 in Eisenach, Bach's father was the director of the town musicians, and all of his uncles were professional musicians. His father taught him violin and harpsichord.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//gadgets-news/googles-first-ai-powered-doodle-celebrates-musician-johann-sebastian-bach-birth-anniversary/articleshow/68516576.cms
2019-03-20,‘Just 3% of desi techies have AI skills',Manash Pratim Gohain,"NEW DELHI: The seventh annual report on employability by Aspiring Minds, one of the largest employability assessment and job credentialing companies in the world, sounds a tocsin for governments and administrators of our technical institutions: The US has a much higher proportion, almost four times, of engineers who can code than India. The report shows that only 3.84% of our engineers have the technical, cognitive, and language skills necessary for software related start-ups. Additionally, a mere 3% of engineers have new-age skills in areas like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, data science, and mobile development. Varun Aggarwal, co-founder and CTO of Aspiring Minds, says: “We found that only about 3% of engineers have new-age skills in AI, data, mobile, and cloud. This is a situation which must be immediately remedied — both for the sake of Indian industry, and our relevance to the world at large.” The employability of Indian engineers continues to be low with over 89% of them unemployable for any job in the knowledge economy . This data came up in an employability survey of 1.7 lakh engineering students and 70,000 engineers seeking jobs in the US and China. The first large-scale study on employability was done in 2010 and the “stubborn unemployability” numbers seem to have held ground ever since; the report further shows that on aggregate, the employability for new-age jobs is 1.7%, on average. While around 18.8% of engineers applying for IT jobs in the US can write correct code, only 4.7% of the engineers can do so in India. Whereas Indian engineers show better potential than Chinese students in writing correct code, a much higher proportion of Indian engineers, around three times, write code that do not even compile (computer program that transforms code written in a programming language into the machine code ). For the first time, the report quantifies the reasons for low employability in India: Only 40% of engineering graduates do an internship and only 36% do projects beyond coursework. While 47% engineers attended industry talks, 60% of the faculty doesn’t talk about the industrial application of concepts, which makes engineering disciplines in India very theoretical. Worse, only about 7% of the candidate pool did multiple internships. “Engineers learn by doing and not reading. We found that the proportion of engineers taking up projects beyond curriculum and doing internships is low. Further, the faculty barely talks about industrial application of concepts in class, even as the exposure of students through industry talks is also wanting,” Varun said. The report recommended employability assessments and training programmes from the first year of university study, including all incoming students to be assessed on basic skills and, based on the results, three to six months training programmes in students’ gap areas. It also recommended private colleges and universities to start building niche research programmes, reform college examination system, and encourage internship programmes and push project-based learning.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/just-3-of-desi-techies-have-ai-skills/articleshow/68489793.cms
2019-03-12,Students develop AI-based surveillance software,TNN,"Kochi: After winning multiple awards at various innovation expos, a group final year computer science students from University Engineering College, Thrissur, is awaiting an opportunity to prove their merit before cyber cell sleuths. Their brainchild, a cloud-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) software, offers multifarious solutions in surveillance analytics. Christened CloudVU, the software helps precise facial recognition, person tracking, traffic and civil violation detection and violence detection. “The AI video surveillance and analytics is a fairly new and blooming industry, where CCTV footages are fed to an online server and by using video analytics and machine learning, threats are identified and reported. Our software will help analyse video footage more quickly and it has the ability to spot troubling behaviour without human supervision. This will take police investigation to a different level,” said team leaderMohamed Zakeer. CloudVU works on an algorithm named ‘MultiAnalytica’ developed by the students, which offers maximum accuracy in minimum time. The makers, who have approached the cyber cell of Palakkad police with the software, claimed that it was a safe choice for law enforcement agencies. With the software,the existing CCTV and surveillance camera infrastructure can be converted to a more intelligent and responsive one thus helping the law enforcement agencies detect violations on real-time. Former chief of Palakkad district police Debeshkumar Behera said the software would be helpful in redefining the existing surveillance system. “Also, the current method of static recording of visuals could only help in post-crime analysis and not in preventing a crime. AI-based surveillance already exists in foreign countries and has greatly contributed to crime deterrence by making the police aware of a possible situation in advance,” he said. The students submitted the proposal when Behera was at the helm of the district and the cyber cell has been checking its viability. The technology can turn any camera into an intelligent security appliance without requiring separate hardware. It could be a breakthrough in accuracy and especially in facial recognition as it can recognize a person even with face half covered by cross-matching the facial mapping with available images in database. The team has also approached the railways offering AI based assistance in surveillance in ladies compartment of trains. “The CCTV visuals of a women’s compartment can be continuously monitored and any kind of suspicious activity such as presence of a man or struggles can be immediately notified to authorities,” Zakeer. The students are gearing up to launch a startup, named Lares, for the commercial production of the software.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/students-develop-ai-based-surveillance-software/articleshow/68365675.cms
2019-03-10,"To bring humanness to tech, we need talent from humanities and not just coders, say creators of Microsoft's AI assistant",Sonam Joshi,"Voice assistants may be getting smarter, but behind every quip and joke there are still flesh-and-blood human beings doing the hard work. Microsoft content managers Jonathan Foster and Deborah Harrison craft responses and design personalities for the company’s personal assistant Cortana and chatbots. They talk to Sunday Times about the thrill of bringing AI closer to us What goes into designing a personality for artificial intelligence ? We think about archetypes or personas. As part of our Personality Chat project, we have created three bot personalities: the professional, the friend and the comic. The professional is rather formal, the friend is more comfortable sharing likes and dislikes and making jokes, and the comic is more sarcastic and less likely to answer seriously. Yet, we still have boundaries in place. The comic isn’t mean either, so if somebody tells the comic they’re sad, we don’t make fun of the person. But what do you do when the person with the query is using abusive language or saying something racially problematic? In these cases, we won’t differentiate in the responses because the best way to handle that is to avoid making a game out of it and set clear boundaries. And we can’t not answer because not answering will feel like an answer. Tech firms are now hiring people from liberal arts. Jonathan, you have screenwriting experience yourself. Can this make tech more humane? In UX or user experience writing, we have to make the language in the products feel more human because the era we’re in now is about bringing humanness to technology. So there are opportunities for folks like me who have no technical background. Before this, we needed people with computer science degrees. Now, we’re looking at people from the humanities — artists, philosophers, journalists and playwrights. As long as we believe the person has the capacity to meet the technical requirements, we feel confident we can train them. What we can’t teach is empathy, we need someone who already has that. Most voice assistants have female names and speak in female voices by default. Deborah, can you tell us how you tackle gender stereotypes? For me, this was an area of passion long before I ever got into tech. When we started on Cortana, we talked a lot about the fact that the name had a gender associated with it. It was also decided that the first voice talent we hired would be a female voice. We were aware that it played into certain gender stereotypes, and we crafted some principles to counter the negative stereotypes: If you ever ask Cortana about her identity, she is going to answer she’s not a woman, she’s not a girl. Six years ago, we decide to use a female coded pronoun, she/her, because at the time the only other viable option was ‘it’, which felt very impersonal and problematic. One model we talked about was Star Trek, where the computer has a woman’s voice. At the time, in the 1960s, that was considered insane because men are the ones who “know stuff”. Cortana is confident, Cortana does not apologise when Cortana hasn’t done anything wrong. For women, the pressure to apologise is very strong in our culture, so we crafted the personality and expression to counter any obvious biases. AI is writing novels, and AI-generated art is fetching thousands of dollars. Is that the future? Anything’s possible, but if AI’s writing novels and someone is selling them, it is pure commerce. People are buying it because a bot wrote it. It has nothing to do with content. Henry Ford invented the manufacturing line where people stand doing the same thing over and over — that’s not a very human experience, it’s just a job. But when machinery begins to take over human jobs, that’s going to force us to reflect on what it means to be human and if a novel is meant to be a personal expression, then there will be people who will reject the AI-written one and want the one written by the person slaving over a typewriter eight hours a day. The media can be replicated but art is a human experience. Google Assistant got about 4.5 lakh marriage proposals from users in India. Have you encountered this as well? Yes. We have a playful response like ‘okay, you work on being more digital, and I’ll work on being more human.’ If it moves into deeper territory, for example when someone says ‘I love you’, that could be someone expressing affection or a kid testing out what happens. But if someone asks for a kiss, it crosses into problematic territory and we draw a line. Do you foresee deeper human-AI bonds? We know people form relationships with their devices. We saw it long before computers, when people named their cars, sewing machines and other inanimate objects that don’t interact in any way. Now you have a thing that is interacting with you so you are going to form a relationship. But are devices going to replace people? We would say no, but we are doing our work predicated on the idea that people are forming a connection.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/to-bring-humanness-to-tech-we-need-talent-from-humanities-and-not-just-coders-say-creators-of-microsofts-ai-assistant/articleshow/68337645.cms
2019-03-07,IIIT-H turns game-changer as AI makes inroads into badminton,tnn,"HYDERABAD: Artificial intelligence ( AI ) has now made inroads into badminton with the International Institute of Information Technology’s ( IIIT-H ) prototype analysing the sport by tracking a player’s every stroke broadcast on television or internet. While other sports such as cricket and soccer had adopted emerging technologies for analytics, a team of researchers from IIIT-H’s Center for Visual Information Technology (CVIT) felt that tennis analytics was stuck in the dark ages. With Hyderabad making it big in the badminton circuit, the CVIT attempted to extend usage of AI to racquet sports. “We picked sports analytics as our first business case. Application of computer vision in sports is an upcoming area. We zeroed in on badminton because not only has there been a fairly deep amount of work done but there is also an excellent badminton ecosystem in Hyderabad,” said Prakash Yalla, head of technology transfer office and Product Labs. Sports video data is recorded for nearly every major tournament but remains archived and inaccessible, thereby restricting its viewing sequentially or manually. The prototype developed by CVIT provides an end-to-end framework under which a large corpus of badminton broadcast videos can segment the points played and track and recognise the players’ each point and annotate their respective strokes. “The algorithms can identify when a rally has started or ended and who won the rally (player identification). It provides segmentation of the shots played (backhand, forehand, smash) thereby revealing the style of the player. By generating heat maps based on how fast the player(s) moves on court, one can also deduce the dominant player,” said Yalla. The algorithm, developed over a period of two to three years, now has takers from the broadcasting industry. “After the success of the pilot project, we’ve had multiple requests from former students who wish to be involved in setting up sports-analytics-based startups. There lies an entrepreneurial opportunity for anyone who can build a business around this,” said Yalla.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ai-makes-inroads-into-badminton/articleshow/68294464.cms
2019-03-07,"AI is the most profound tech of this era, says Salesforce",Shilpa Phadnis,"Bengaluru: As machines make deeper inroads into the workplace, tectonic shifts are taking place in the job market. The Future of Jobs report 2018 presented at the World Economic Forum identified some roles that are declining and others that are emerging. The job roles losing the race to machines and algorithms include data entry clerks, assembly and factory workers, business services and administration managers, and stock-keeping clerks. Jobs that are emerging include data analysts and scientists, AI and machine learning specialists, big data specialists, new tech specialists and organisation development experts. Between 2018 and 2022, 75 million current job roles are expected to be displaced by machines and algorithms, the report said. On the sunny side, 133 million new jobs are expected to emerge during the same period. “Social, mobility, analytics and cloud (SMAC) is table stakes. We are talking about distributed ledger, AI, 3D printing, mixed reality and other amazing new tech,” Vala Afshar, chief digital evangelist at Salesforce told TOI on the sidelines of the Nasscom India Technology Forum held in Mumbai recently. Afshar described AI as the most profound tech that he has ever worked on. “Companies are appreciating the power of data. Data is the oil of the 21st century. But oil is just useless thick goop until you refine it into fuel. AI is your refinery,” said Afshar. An Accenture report said that AI has the potential to add $957 billion to India’s economy by 2035. Accenture has 20,000 AI professionals and over 6,000 deep AI experts implementing 11,000 client engagements and filing over 600 patents in AI. Paul Daugherty, chief technology & innovation officer in the company, says the word `artificial’ in artificial intelligence is a misleading word. “It’s actually about taking the best human intelligence and combining it with machine intelligence and applying it to a business problem. So we call it applied intelligence,” Daugherty said. On the robotic revolution, the WEF report said stationary robots would be the most widely adopted by 2022. This, it said, would be followed by non-humanoid land robots, and then humanoid robots, and aerial and underwater robots. The first adoption of stationary robots would be in automation, aerospace and supply chain. The oil and gas sector is expected to adopt aerial and underwater robots, while humanoid robots are expected first to be used in financial services. Afshar, like his boss Marc Benioff, believes AI is a human right. “We are risking a new tech divide, between those who have access to AI and those who don’t. Those without AI are going to be weaker and poorer, less educated and sicker. We must ask ourselves, ‘Is this the kind of world we want to live in?’” Afshar said Salesforce has hired a chief ethics officer to help understand what design needs to go into its products and services to ensure ethical use of AI. “Maintaining trust perhaps is the hardest and most rewarding thing a company can do,” he said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ai-is-the-most-profound-tech-of-this-era-says-salesforce/articleshow/68294406.cms
2019-03-03,AI centre planned at MSU to check financial frauds,Prashant Rupera,"VADODARA: If things go as planned, MS University will house an artificial intelligence (AI) centre. A proposal to set up AI centre at the university campus has been moved by country’s leading multinational bank - the Bank of Baroda (BoB). Coming from the top brass of BoB, the proposal that will be placed before the university’s syndicate members on Sunday is expected to get an instant green signal. BoB’s managing director and CEO P S Jayakumar has written a letter to MSU vice-chancellor professor Parimal Vyas to set up the AI centre. “Having a fortune of the shared history, we would like to deepen relationship with MSU to create a better future for our society,” the letter states, adding that the proposed centre is aimed to further research in AI, develop transformative applications and prepare the student-faculty body to be future-ready. “Success of the AI centre will depend on the four key pillars – attracting bright students for building AI skills, setting up a state-of-the-art AI lab and communicating success of the centre to the larger world,” the letter further states. BoB has proposed that it will raise the corpus of funds for running the centre. Sources in the university said that the proposed centre will work on problem solving related to financial and banking sector as well as help the bank deal with financial frauds which are on the rise. It is worth mentioning here that many Indian banks have started deploying AI in a big way to improve efficiency, detect human behaviour and reduce operational costs since last year. BoB has evolved an innovative concept by setting up of hi-tech digital branch equipped with advanced gadgets like AI robot named Baroda Brainy and digital lab with free Wi-Fi services. AI is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines and has become an essential part of the technology industry. “Research associated with AI is highly technical and specialised,” the concept note for the centre states, adding that the core problems of AI include programming computers for certain traits such as knowledge, reasoning, problem solving, perception, learning, planning and ability to manipulate and move objects.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ai-centre-planned-at-msu-to-check-financial-frauds/articleshow/68237622.cms

2019-02-19,AI researcher named next director of IIT-Bombay,Yogita Rao,"IIT-Bombay. (File photo) MUMBAI: Fifty-six-year-old Subhasis Chaudhuri, professor and artificial intelligence (AI) researcher from the electrical engineering department of IIT-Bombay, will soon take over as the new director of the institute. Appointed by the Centre, he is likely to take charge on April 15. He will replace Devang Khakhar, who is in his second consecutive term, having first been appointed in 2009 and getting an extension in 2014. Chaudhuri, whose appointment is for five years, has already held several administrative positions in the institute, including deputy director (academic and infrastructural affairs), dean ( international relations), head of the electrical engineering department and wardenship of hostels. He is currently the Kamalnayan Bajaj Chair Professor in the department and the professor in charge of IITBombay Monash Academy at IIT Bombay. Recipient of the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for excellence in research, Chaudhuri is known for his work in image processing, computer vision , machine learning and computational haptics, all of which broadly fall under AI. He has been associated with the institute for almost three decades. “We have already shown that we can do good research and teaching and now we have to take it to the next level.

2019-02-16,AI is getting really good at writing fake news,Bloomberg,"The use of fake news stories for political disinformation has become a major concern for governments around the world in the wake of the 2016 US presidential election. The FBI concluded Russia used false news reports, spread through social media, to try to sway voters. Writing these stories still needed someone to sit behind a keyboard. Now OpenAI , a non-profit artificial intelligence research group in San Francisco , has unveiled a machine learning algorithm that can generate coherent text, including fake news articles, after being given just a small sample to build on. The algorithm can be tuned to imitate the writing style of the sample text. Here’s an example of the system at work that OpenAI provided. The system was only given the first two sentences, which were written by a human: A train carriage containing controlled nuclear materials was stolen in Cincinnati today. Its whereabouts are unknown. And this is the rest of the news article that the AI wrote, with no human guidance: The incident occurred on the downtown train line, which runs from Covington and Ashland stations. In an email to Ohio news outlets, the US department of energy said it is working with the Federal Railroad Administration to find the thief. “The theft of this nuclear material will have significant negative consequences on public and environmental health, our workforce and the economy of our nation,” said Tom Hicks , the US energy secretary, in a statement. “Our top priority is to secure the theft and ensure it doesn’t happen again.” The stolen material was taken from the University of Cincinnati’s Research Triangle Park nuclear research site, according to a news release from department officials. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission did not immediately release any information. According to the release, the US department of energy’s office of nuclear material safety and security is leading that team’s investigation. “The safety of people, the environment and the nation’s nuclear stockpile is our highest priority,” Hicks said. “We will get to the bottom of this and make no excuses.” Because of its potential to be misused for creating disinformation, OpenAI said it had chosen not to make the most powerful versions of its algorithm available for public nor was it publishing the source code and training data used for the software.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/ai-is-getting-really-good-at-writing-fake-news/articleshow/68019023.cms
2019-02-12,AI-toting Gujarat cops still brandish scrapped IT law,Ashish Chauhan,"Picture for representational purpose only. AHMEDABAD: Gujarat Police , which is using artificial intelligence to trap traffic offenders, is jumping constitutional signals in merry ignorance. The tech-savvy police force uses an IT law rendered obsolete by the highest court of the land. On March 24, 2015, the Supreme Court had passed a judgment striking down Section 66A of Information Technology (IT) Act, holding it unconstitutional as the law hit the root of liberty and freedom of expression. But Gujarat Police has continuously been slapping the law on people. Police had registered 20 cases when the law existed between February 5, 2009 and March 23, 2015 which has almost doubled to 37 after it was held null and void. It has been gathered through an RTI application dated December 17, 2018, that Gujarat Police booked 33 persons in 20 cases under Section 66A of the IT Act, which deals with punishment for sending offensive messages through communication services, between February 2009 and March 23, 2015, at eight police stations in Rajkot, Bharuch, Nadiad , Vadodara, Tapi and Morbi districts. But, since March 24, 2015, when a SC division bench comprising Justice J Chelameswar and Justice R F Nariman held the section null and void, Gujarat Police has arrested 43 persons in 37 cases. Complaints will be withdrawn in a phased manner: CID But, since March 24, 2015, when a SC division bench comprising Justice J Chelameswar and Justice R F Nariman held the section null and void, Gujarat Police has arrested 43 persons in 37 cases. These cases were registered in 16 police stations of Kutch, Bharuch, Rajkot, Mehsana, Surendranagar, Valsad, Morbi, Nadiad, Vapi, Surat and Banaskantha districts. Two police stations — Langhnaj in Mehsana and Wankaner — did not register a single FIR when the law was in force but registered one case each after the section was scrapped. A senior police official of Gujarat Police said that the police department does not hold regular training sessions to make the cops aware of the changes in law. “Even a police inspector of Gaekwad Haveli police station of Ahmedabad had filed such a case against a lawyer in August last year,” said a source. Senior advocate S V Raju said cops cannot file cases under section 66A. “If this section is invoked by police in an FIR, the charges pertaining to it will be quashed by the court. A person can initiate contempt of court proceedings also against responsible officer not following the apex court’s order.” Gujarat DGP Shivanand Jha did not comment on the issue directing the query to DGP, CID (crime) Ashish Bhatia. Bhatia said that cops would begin to withdraw complaints filed under Section 66A in phase wise manner. “We would file C summary in all such cases. Wherever cases have reached the courts and chargesheeted, the same will be withdrawn after taking permission from concerned courts,” said Bhatia.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ai-toting-gujarat-cops-still-brandish-scrapped-it-law/articleshow/67951215.cms
2019-02-10,ISI looks to set up research unit for artificial intelligence,Suman Chakraborti,"KOLKATA: The Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) has applied for 4 acres of land at Bengal Silicon Valley in New Town, where they plan to set up a Centre of Excellence on artificial intelligence . ISI director Sanghamitra Bandyopadhaya said the centre would provide facilities for research and training on emerging technologies. “It would be a large-scale research-cum-training facility for students, researchers and industry people on emerging trends, such as artificial intelligence and data science with application of statistics,” she said. Besides ISI, a number of IT companies and research and development institutes, including Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS), have shown interest in getting land at the New Town IT hub in the second phase of land allotment process. According to a source in the state IT & E department, Cognizant have asked for 25 acres under the government’s new land value exchange policy, framed to relocate all IT companies from Bantala to New Town. Cognizant currently has two campuses in Bantala. Society for Applied Microwave Research (SAMEER), an autonomous research and development laboratory, set up in Mumbai in 1984 under the ministry of electronics and information technology, has also applied for three acres of land, where it plans to expand its existing research and development unit in the state. SAMEER’s Kolkata centre was set up in 1994 for conducting research in millimetre wave technology. Capgemini, that had earlier applied in the first phase and then pulled out of it, has again submitted application for seven acres. Of the 200 acres of land in Silicon Valley, 107 acres are in the allotment process. Hidco had floated the expression of interest for allotting 74 acres of land in the first phase, of which Reliance Jio applied for 40 acres, TCS 20 acres and FirstSource 4 acres. The authorities floated the second expression of interest last month, to allot another 90 acres.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/isi-looks-to-set-up-research-unit-for-artificial-intelligence/articleshow/67923636.cms

2019-02-06,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), internet of things power student projects to manage disasters",TNN,"BENGALURU: Artificial Intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT) and mixed reality powered drones, applications and projects targeted at predicting or managing natural disasters in a more effective manner emerged as winners of the Codefundo++ National Challenge, organised by Microsoft India. Over 5,000 students from 21 top engineering colleges participated in the challenge, which kicked off in September 2018 under the theme, “Building state-of-the-art technology to predict or manage natural disasters better”. These were then whittled down to the 21 top projects, with IIT Madras ultimately emerging as the winner, followed by IIT Guwahati and IIT Jodhpur as the first and second runners-up on Tuesday. The teams won cash prizes of Rs 5 lakh, Rs 3 lakh and Rs 1 lakh respectively, and received credits for the AI for Earth programme launched by Microsoft. IIT Madras: UAVs for Disaster Management (Ayush Maniar, Rajat Singhal, Pranav Pawar) “When a disaster strikes, it’s extremely important to be able to identify the affected people, who may need emergency medical care. This drone powered by AI, fitted with a camera and using activity recognition software, will be able to transmit real-time information on the locations of the people who may either be injured, stranded or covered in debris. Since a single drone may not be able to cover an entire city, a swarm of them can be used,” said Ayush Maniar. IIT Guwahati: DUBG (Pavan Kumar, Ekagra Ranjan, Vivek Raj) “DisasterUnknown’s Battleground (DUBG) is a mixed reality app for efficient post-disaster management. During rescue operations, time is of the essence, and so we have built this app based on mixed reality, to ensure that rescuers don’t waste additional time on operating communication devices. The augmented reality (AR) navigation functionality will allow users to view their route to the victims even at night or in storms, through AR. Through AR notification, messages can be projected in AR on the location of the sender, allowing receivers to view important messages, like informing other rescue teams of road blockages or the state of the victims,” said Ekagra Ranjan. IIT Jodhpur: Disaster Chain (Anshul Ahuja, Aksh Chordia, Ayush Saxena) A distributed IoT-based solution, our project can be deployed in different rooms of a building and will act as an early warning system and takes precautionary measures on detection of disasters. For instance, if an earthquake is detected, it will kill the water, gas and power supplies, all of which could be the cause of hazards. The data will also be recorded and can be analysed later. The second part of our project, works with an app, which can predict skin diseases, that could potentially be contracted by survivors of disasters like tsunamis, floods and earthquakes and will assist in a faster diagnosis,” said Anshul Ahuja.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ai-iot-power-student-projects-to-manage-disasters/articleshow/67858079.cms
2019-02-03,"Year of the Post, Influencer or AI? Here are the ‘frontrunners’",TNN,"Shivanand Mohanty Shivanand Mohanty For the UN, 2019 is the year of indigenous languages. For keen participants in the world’s largest democracy, 2019 is Election Year. For cricket fans, 2019 is World Cup year. For true George R R Martin fans, 2019 looks like another year of waiting, never mind all the hype about the Game of Thrones season finale on TV. And for us in advertising? Our profession is famous for being unpredictable. In fact, it’s one of the reasons many of us joined this business and still stick around; you never know what tomorrow will bring. But, heart in mouth and tongue firmly in cheek, let me gaze into the crystal ball and try to understand what I see. (“But the year is already four weeks old,” you say, ‘You’re late!” Yes, but did anything good from Creative ever come on time?) The Year of the ‘ Influencer ’ We’ve all seen the presentations. Guaranteeing us, and our brands, a gazillion views and likes, shares, and subscriptions beyond measure — if we ride the ‘influencer’ wave. Then along comes a picture of an egg and it gets more views than the most famous Instagrammer. So, if like me, you don’t completely get the social media ‘funda’, maybe it’s all an ‘anda’? The Year of the Post For clients and creatives alike, our waking hours are increasingly spent on crafting quick posts. After all, most of our customers are ‘screenagers’. Take a ride on the metro — regardless of age and gender, almost everyone’s attention is fixed on a mobile screen. In fact, Goafest will add a new category: ‘Post of the Year’ (and get an egg to chair the jury for that one). The Year of the Specialist The advertising agency has splintered into creative, media, BTL (below the line), digital, social media, and more. And 2019 will see newer specialisations. The crystal ball is opening up unheard-of possibilities — an agency that only focuses on creating Tamil hoardings, that only does tent cards for electronics shops, that only ‘hacks growth’ for mobile app companies, that only does films and videos for less than, let’s say, Rs 20 lakh… the opportunities are endless. Some might even be profitable. The Year of AI I’m not talking about artificial intelligence that will crunch numbers and produce never-before consumer insights. AI has already helped write (yes, write!) a Toyota Mirai campaign. Now, I’m thinking an AI programme that will read your AV (audiovisual) script, understand key words, search through stock footage on the net, and craft three edits overnight. For all AI people reading this and saying, “I could do that!” – could you also make a programme that will help make briefs understandable? Thanks in advance. The Year of Instant Our industry is famously known to respond to most questions with, “I’ll get back to you”. Earlier, that meant, “I’ll go back to office, talk to my colleagues, understand your problem, then come back with a response”, in a few weeks, which came down to a few days. Today, expectations are fixed at hours. In 2019, this will come down even further. We will all be online, responding to clients as fast as we respond to friends on instant messaging (shudder!). The Year of the Unexpected This is something we all await with eager anticipation. Year after year of going through the grind of increasing demands and shorter response times has convinced us that the turnaround is near. Maybe 2019 is the year. The year of exponentially increasing media and production budgets. The year of burgeoning retainers. The year of more effective advertising creatives. The year of even more efficient media buys… But now, the crystal ball is getting cloudy. Or is that the world-class Delhi-NCR pollution?

2019-01-27,"India is losing the AI battle to China, one app at a time",Pankaj Mishra,"A year ago, there were only 18 Chinese mobile apps among the top 100 apps on Google Playstore in India, and only two of them among the top ten. The number, as my FactorDaily colleague Shadma Shaikh wrote earlier this month, has now doubled. TikTok , a short video-hosting social platform, already counts India as its biggest market with 39% of its 500 million global users based here. And it’s not the only app being touted as a potential YouTube killer in India. LIKE and Kwai, apart from other live-streaming apps such as LiveMe and BigoLive, are other contenders for the position of the top video app in India. Quietly and steadily, China’s app factory has been conquering India, far away from the mainstream noise about e-commerce and telecom. And very soon, these Chinese apps will have more data and insights about the next billion Indian internet users than any other platform, including Facebook and Google. Why does that matter? China wants to dominate the AI world and fast-pace its transition from being a factory of the world to becoming a high-value destination for smart machines that mimic the human brain. Acquiring more data and throwing it all at the machines so they learn faster and deeper, is the holy grail for AI dominance. Consumer apps such as TikTok and BigoLive that have massive engagement with their users and capture hundreds of millions of data sets everyday feed into China’s big data arsenal. And while India will retain its status as the world’s battlefield for acquiring the next billion users, it will be about the American and Chinese internet companies looking to conquer the final frontier. Already, two of India’s biggest e-commerce companies — Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart — are US enterprises. Let’s look at how China’s app factories carefully put together their own playbook. It is all about pushing the boundaries, focusing obsessively on the vernacular market and doing whatever it takes to go viral (including soft porn). Kwai, for instance, is a breeding ground for child pornography. The app encourages users, especially underage girls to perform vulgar gestures and lip sync to suggestive songs, among other acts. Chinese platforms are beginning to realise the dangers of pushing soft porn content for achieving virality. LiveMe, for instance, had to delete 600,000 accounts of children under 13 after Fox11 news channel in Los Angeles talked of the dangers of paedophiles exploiting children. To be sure, these apps are well-designed products in terms of technology sophistication and user interfaces. ByteDance, for instance, has designed and launched Helo, a regional entertainment content platform specifically for India. If you haven’t heard of Helo yet, it’s only because the app only targets small-town, first-time, vernacular users. Helo is not even available in English. It is available in 14 regional languages including Hindi , Marathi, Gujarati and Bhojpuri. The strategy is already paying off. In fact, for some of these Chinese apps, India is the only market of focus. SHAREit, a social content platform, believes it will have to shut down if there’s no India market for the app. They have watched the India market closely for years and learned from the failures too. WeChat , which failed to make any dent, is a case study for any new Chinese app entrant to learn what not to do. And then, there’s India’s homegrown Sharechat, which was launched in 2015 and has over 50 million downloads. Sharechat demonstrated how savvy and first-time internet users in India’s tier 2 and tier 3 towns can be tapped with vernacular content. Chinese apps such as ByteDance’s Helo have been really quick to learn from Sharechat’s playbook. For its part, the US is already planning to clamp down on China’s investments in Silicon Valley with the Congress passing the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (Firrma) last August. Several startup founders and investors have been talking in hushed tones about the need for India to look at similar tactics. The stakes are high. Already, Chinese companies have invested more than $2 billion in Indian startups in 2017 alone. Meanwhile, India’s classic love-hate affair with China is already catching up with the country’s fledgling startup ecosystem. Startup founders and investors in India are beginning to feel increased government scrutiny, often caught in the middle of “Doklam-like” confrontations. A board member at one of the top Indian startups backed by a Chinese fund decided to quit, sensing upcoming “complexities”. ""This year is going to be about economic nationalism,"" he told me. “And I would rather not be seen as being on the other side.” ( Mishra writes on technology’s intersection with society in India )",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/india-is-losing-the-ai-battle-to-china-one-app-at-a-time/articleshow/67704593.cms

2019-01-19,"AI helps track cows’ fertility cycle, maximise yield",TNN,"Bengaluru: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and wearable technology have reached a dairy farm in Karnataka. With many health-conscious Bengalureans turning to organic milk, a startup in the business has gone hi-tech to maximise production. Happy Milk, a Bengaluru-based organic milk startup, which has set up a stall at the ongoing Organics and Millets 2019 International Trade Fair, monitors the daily activities of 400 cows in its 30-acre Tumakuru farm through wearable technology devices strapped on to the cows’ legs. Developed by international technology group GEA, the precision livestock farming technology device gives farmers a complete insight into the animal’s health, well-being and fertility. Through round-the-clock monitoring, the device even tells the farmer when the animal is in heat, when the time is right for insemination and whenever there is an unexpected drop in the amount of time spent walking or standing — which may indicate lameness. The cows can be monitored through mobile devices and PCs. Speaking about their tech-driven farm, Mehal Kejriwal, co-founder, Happy Milk, said, “A group of 15 people handle the entire farm. With the help of technology, we’ve cut down manpower and time while enhancing efficiency.” “With many realising that a majority of dairy products in the market are adulterated, the demand for organic milk has gone up in Bengaluru. Today, we sell close to 4000 litres per day in Bengaluru alone with delivery to homes and through supermarkets. The cows are fed 100% organic food. Organic milk is most in demand in Whitefield, Koramangala, Sadashivanagar and HSR Layout,” she added. KC Raghu, managing director of Pristine Organics, which has set up a stall at the fair, pointed out how the demand for organic and millet-based baby food is on the rise in areas like Indiranagar, Jayanagar, Basavanagudi and Rajajinagar. “There is a renewed interest in old grains, which were once part and parcel of every diet in Karnataka. Baby cereal made with organic ragi, organic mixed millet flakes and organic whole rice supplement for children are especially in demand in certain areas of the city,” said Raghu.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ai-helps-track-cows-fertility-cycle-maximise-yield/articleshow/67592337.cms
2019-01-19,IIT-M incubated One Fourth Labs to offer low-cost AI training,TNN,"Chennai: A team of faculty members from IIT- Madras have launched One Fourth Labs, an edtech startup that wants to skill Indian workforce in the areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI) at almost one-tenth the industry upskilling prices. One Fourth Labs’ flagship course PadhAI will provide India-specific courses on AI, and is open to all students, faculty, and professionals with a basic background in mathematics and Python. The course fee for students and faculty is Rs 1,000 and it will cost Rs 5,000 for working professionals. The startup is also offering a full fee waiver for women who are getting back to work after a break and would like to get updated in AI. Founded by Mitesh M. Khapra and Pratyush Kumar, assistant professors, department of computer science and engineering at IIT-Madras, and incubated at IIT Madras’ Incubation Cell, the venture will also create AI-powered apps in collaboration with SMEs and the larger industry. “There are several courses on AI available online and through universities, but most of these courses are not designed keeping Indian students in mind in terms of technical background. Amongst those that do, several are highly priced, with fees running from few tens of thousands to lakhs of rupees,” professor Pratyush Kumar said. According to Kumar, the objective of the course is to solve complex challenges that are specific to India using AI. “For instance, we want to bring students together to build an AI solution such as Google Lens but for Indian languages and Indian contexts,” he says. The course will be imparted online to reach a critical mass, but it also has an offline component, wherein every year, top performing students will be picked for an AI residency program at IIT Madras Research Park where they can create solutions that have social impact and commercial value. The four-month course comprises 80 hours of lecture content and requires equivalent time in solving assignments.

2019-01-15,Artificial Intelligence and Python in school curriculum to make students future-ready,Rajlakshmi Ghosh,"Familiarising students with new technologies will make the teaching-learning process fruitful, say academicians In a bid to have a useful modern-day curriculum, the CBSE decides to include Artificial Intelligence (AI) as an optional skill subject in classes VIII, IX and X from the next academic session. Schools are waking up to the fact that students need to be future-ready where AI is the reality, and are making efforts to use this technology to fill the gaps in teaching and learning. Artificial Intelligence has already come into our lives, and hence it is important to introduce older students to concepts around this. ""Introducing such topics at the right age helps the students understand the impact, both good and extreme, about technology that is still in its nascent stage but being researched and tested rapidly. Same students will pick careers in AI and hence equipping them with the right information and perspective as part of their school curriculum is imperative,"" says Mona Seervai, head of school - Mount Litera School International, Mumbai. ""Technology has made things easier by introducing faster channels of communication between students and teachers. In our school, we no longer have to only rely on hard paper copies for our homework or test, and in that sense, AI integrated technology is a big help. Our Grade X examinations are now e-assessments, hence it requires students and teachers to be comfortable with the use of technology,"" adds Seervai. Mount Litera School recently organised a workshop with machine learning expert Jehan Shams where students were told about the complex world of AI and its ethical implications. But then, the occasional workshop and seminar on AI may not be adequate to formally incorporate AI as part of the school learning cycle, says Mark Nelson who heads the IT department at Shiv Nadar School. ""There is a need for overall information literacy at the school level where the induction of AI is not happening organically. Teachers need to be equipped with AI learning as an application tool and also as a subject."" ""Besides, schools need to invest in resources, time and infrastructure to enable students to become tech leaders of tomorrow,"" adds Nelson, as his school has integrated machine learning (sub-set of artificial intelligence), robotics, deep learning , graphic designing, 3D printing as part of its technology programme and got students to develop projects to solve societal problems. Chalk and board vs AI-aided learning Nelson observes that AI is being heavily used in the online tutoring segment so the debate is not between the traditional chalk and board system of pedagogy and AI-aided learning but more between online and offline (physical) classrooms. He also feels teachers need to be better equipped with AI learning if they are to address students' individualised educational needs since a one a size fits all formula of teaching is no longer effective. Talking about AI's benefits, Beas Dev Ralhan, founder and CEO of Next Education India says, ""The time and cost that an AI-application would take to accomplish a task would be miniscule as compared to that of a human meditator. AI-based devices can save a teacher's time by doing routine jobs such as taking attendance, presenting study material on connected display screens as per the instructional schedule, and helping teachers navigate through the displayed content with ease. It can also assist in evaluating tests for Science, Math and Social Studies besides providing links to learning materials (videos and articles) to mitigate the learning gaps."" AI apart, CBSE also plans to introduce Python language in the Class XII Computer Science examinations from the academic year 2019. Such initiatives, feels Nelson, will get the stakeholders thinking and finding ways to integrate technology into the curriculum and classroom.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//education/news/artificial-intelligence-and-python-in-school-curriculum-to-make-students-future-ready/articleshow/67535741.cms
2019-01-13,"CT bag scans, AI gadgets to power hi-tech shield for IGI",Jasjeev Gandhiok,"IGI Airport. NEW DELHI: IGI Airport in the capital may soon see introduction of a number of technologies to bolster its security. Central Industrial Security Force ( CISF ), which is in charge of the airport’s security, is looking at technologies like CT baggage screening , artificial intelligence-driven gadgets and even a biometric-based entry system. The need to introduce these technologies was discussed recently at a Global Aviation Security Symposium (AVSEC 2018) in Canada and officials say they are checking a number of aviation gadgets, which are already being successfully used abroad. One of the technologies is computerised tomography (CT)-based screening for cabin baggage — a technology that was recently tested at London’s Heathrow Airport. In addition to generating a comprehensive image that can be rotated to check each individual item inside a luggage, the technology can also improve efficiency with passengers not requiring to take out liquid items for manual checking. A CISF official said its images are also clearer than those generated by an X-ray scanner, allowing security personnel to spend less time on a bag. “We are looking at a number of technologies, some of which can be adopted this year. The first stage is to carry out testing and once we do that, we will send reports to Bureau of Civil Aviation Security and the civil aviation ministry. We have been keeping them updated and these new features have been in the works for some time,” said Hemendra Singh, assistant inspector general, CISF. CISF also plans to utilise automated tray return systems (ATRS) across airports in the country, similar to what is being used abroad, to reduce the time personnel spend in manually collecting trays during the security check. In this case, the tray will automatically return to the starting point, increasing passenger thoroughfare substantially, CISF says. The symposium, organised by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), also looked at artificial intelligence , with CISF planning to test new gadgets that can reduce human intervention. Among those options are robotic dogs. “While dog squads will continue to be a part of our security, robot dogs are also an option,” said a CISF official. Last year, CISF tested a biometric-based entry system at both Bengaluru and Hyderabad airports and its successful implementation is likely to reduce problems of fake ticket entry. “The barcode system on the ticket will provide information immediately and allow entry to people only with a valid ticket. In cases of fake tickets, the system will reject it immediately,” said Singh. CISF had last year incorporated body-worn cameras as part of its security at IGI Airport after testing it out at both Delhi Metro and the airport. The camera is worn with the uniform and generally attached around the torso, letting CISF personnel use the footage in cases of an argument due to suspicious passenger movement.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ct-bag-scans-ai-gadgets-to-power-hi-tech-shield-for-igi/articleshow/67506856.cms

Chakrabarti said the courses, which will begin from March this year will be offered at IIT KGP's Kolkata facility, at IIT KGP's Kharagpur campus and at a rented premise at Bengaluru. He said thousands of new jobs were being created in AI sector every year with AI growing at 10-15 per cent on annual rate and there was need to have more skilled people in the AI sector. ""AI is the future which will more invade our lives in the coming days,"" Chakrabarti said. Head, Centre for Artificial Intelligence, IIT KGP, Prof Sudeshna Sarkar said, the course with 300 students will consist of 16 modules - each having 12-hour duration. Around 2 lakh jobs in AI are expected to be created by 2020 in India, Sarkar said. She said the classes will be taken by IIT KGP faculty, reputed academic institutions and industry experts. There will be 60 per cent from the IIT KGP faculty and academics and 40 per cent from industry who will be teaching the students in the 16 modules, Sarkar explained. She said the demand is getting higher in AI in the country than the total number of AI-skilled professionals and there was need to bridge that gap. The course modules have been carefully designed to cover mathematical and algorithmic foundations, AI fundamentals and statistical and machine learning methods. ""The courses will have a blend on fundamental theoretical principles as well as hands-on component and industry use cases and students will have the opportunity to work on live projects. ""Every course module will be based on assignments and exams and a certificate will be awarded based on successful completion of the modules. It will be rigorous,"" she said. The students will be selected competitively from working professionals and senior students. Tools and platforms will be introduced to make the students, from working professionals and senior students, technologically competent and ready for jobs.

2018-12-19,"Artificial intelligence, robotics part of hi-tech Army warfare strategy",Rajat Pandit,"NEW DELHI: The 1.3-million strong Indian Army is now sharpening its entire war-fighting strategy, ranging from creation of agile integrated battle groups (IBGs) and expansive cyber warfare capabilities to induction plans for launch-on-demand micro satellites, directed-energy weapons, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and the like. India is currently faced with a “No War, No Peace” scenario due to the management of the “complex and active” unresolved borders with China and Pakistan, coupled with “hybrid warfare” or “state-sponsored proxy war and acts of terrorism from across the border”, says the Army’s new Land Warfare Doctrine-2018. “A concerted effort is being made by our adversaries to shrink the space for conventional wars, through prosecution of unconventional operations at the lower end of the spectrum, and threats of early and irrational use of nuclear weapons at the other,” warns the doctrine. While stressing the need to prepare for multi-faceted security challenges ahead, the doctrine says “any adversarial attempt to alter the status quo along our borders will be dealt with in a firm and resolute manner”, in a clear reference to the 73-day Doklam troop stand-off with China near the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet trijunction last year. The Army will take steps to resolve “deliberate transgressions” along the 4,057-km long Line of Actual Control with China to “our advantage with minimum escalation” in consonance with existing agreements and protocols. But there is “a need to be prepared for any escalation”. Turning to Pakistan, the doctrine says the Army will continue to prosecute effective counter-terrorism operations, like the “surgical strikes” of September 2016, to “ensure deterrence through punitive responses” against the ongoing proxy war. While further strengthening operational capabilities on the western front, the Army will also enhance its “punitive response options to greater depth, effect, sophistication and precision”. In terms of conventional war, the Army will strive to achieve integrated planning and conduct of “networked theatre battles” through synergized application of land, air and maritime components. “All combat operations will be as IBGs,” it says. The Army brass has already given the go-ahead for IBGs or integrated composite brigades, with five to six battalions each and a mix of infantry, armoured, artillery, air defence, signals and engineers, backed by attack helicopters, under the command of major-generals. The Army currently has 14 corps (led by lieutenant-generals) and 49 divisions (major-generals) under its six operational commands. Each division has three brigades, which in turn have three battalions each. “The IBGs, to be test-bedded in field exercises, will be self-contained, highly mobile and flexible,” said a senior officer. The doctrine, in turn, states the “response along the western front will be sharp and swift with the aim to destroy the adversary’s centre of gravity and secure spatial gains.” In the event of a collusive China-Pakistan threat, the primary front will be dealt with “all the resources in our arsenal” and “a strong strategic defensive balance will be maintained” along the secondary front. Dwelling upon “human-machine teaming”, it says: “At the core of our future military planning will be the effective integration of soldiers, AI and robotics into war-fighting systems that exploit existing capabilities for success in battle.” “Development of micro satellites, lighter and greater capacity transponders, manoeuvrable and intelligent outer space satellites, with short life spans which can be launched on demand, will be the essential future requirements for the Army,” it adds.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/artificial-intelligence-robotics-part-of-hi-tech-army-warfare-strategy/articleshow/67153564.cms
2018-12-15,300 experts brainstorm at int’l meet on AI at BU,TNN,"New Delhi: More than 300 experts took part in the 8th IEEE International Advance Computing Conference (IACC) hosted by Bennett University (BU) on its campus in Greater Noida on December 14 and 15. The key speakers included professor Hong Shen from University of Adelaide, professor Madhavan Swaminathan from Georgia Institute of Technology, professor Ajay Gupta from Western Michigan University and professor Sartaj Sahni from University of Florida.

2018-12-14,Sleepy at the wheel? AI to keep eye on drowsy drivers,Swati Rathor,"Hyderabad: Srinivas Reddy spends long hours on the wheel as a cab driver and often drives all night. His day usually begins at 6am and more often than not, he gets to sleep only the next day at around 8am. On an average, the 42-year-old clocks some 450 kms daily, leaving him fatigued and perennially sleep deprived. But he has to remain awake as even a brief state of drowsiness can be fatal. Each year, around 1.5 lakh people die in road mishaps in India, some of them due to ‘drowsy or sleep driving’. Alarmed by these statistics, a trio of Hyderabad-based techies are trying to harness the power of latest technologies such as Artificial Intelligence to devise an early warning mechanism to prevent such mishaps. “We are working on preventing road accidents by analysing driver behaviour by leveraging AI, mainly machine vision, to detect what happens inside the vehicle and send alerts accordingly,” says Dhushyanth Dachiraju, co-founder and CTO, Eyedentify Systems Pvt Ltd. He explains that the new system under development digitizes video data and creates models that help analyse driving behaviour. Dachiraju explains that the major shortcoming with the current safety solutions available in the market is that they are ‘reactive’ in nature and come in handy only when an accident is about to happen or any untoward incident has happened, whereas his startup’s solutions will be pre-emptive in nature. While Eyedentify is betting big on AI for its latest offering, in the last two years of existence it has built two safety devices for automobiles and has sold nearly 650 units of these mainly to fleet owners. Its first product – Voss -- was an advanced telematics device with a GPS system, sensors and camera that could send images even on low bandwidth. Anirudh Injeti, co-founder and COO, points out that the cost of building this device was higher and the idea behind building it was to ensure better safety of the passengers as the device could monitor the vehicle cabin and send pics of the activity to the central monitoring room of the fleet owner. “In most emergencies, the panic button on the app is the last thing that is accessible to the commuter. Instead of another app or SOS button, this device acted as a major deterrent of crime,” he said, pointing out that the monitoring device failed to take off as the price of the device was high at around Rs 15,000 per unit. Gradually, Eyedentify Systems upgraded Voss to come up with its second security tracking device -- Voss Live – that could live stream and provide a real-time monitoring solution.This product saw a better traction in the market but the team realised that it was sitting on a pile of data (which was being collected via this device) which it could analyse and offer value to customers. “Now we are upgrading it further and building a video analytics platform that can analyse video data being captured on the go and provide insights,” Dachiraju says, adding that the startup intends to launch this product early next year and will target bus, truck and cab fleet owners. This device will not only monitor but also study the driver’s behaviour to prevent accidents. He points out that such products exist only in foreign markets currently but are mainly used in autonomous vehicles. “We have incorporated companies in Singapore and Hong Kong as in the future we plan to sell our products in the south east Asian markets as well. But for now, we are focusing on India,” he said adding that the startup is only going to focus on the enterprise segment and remain a B2B player in the near-term. It has recently raised an angel funding of $135,000 from Brinc and in 2019 it plans to utilise it for marketing activities and to reach out to fleet owners for its solutions. Along with fleet owners, it also intends to tap state transport departments. The startup is currently importing components from US and China and assembling the product in the city near ECIL at Cherlapalli, the city’s electronics hub. “For a small number of devices, we are assembling it here. If the numbers go higher, it makes sense to do it in China,” he adds.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sleepy-at-the-wheel-ai-to-keep-eye-on-drowsy-drivers/articleshow/67098413.cms
2018-12-09,This startup uses AI algorithms to crack down on fake products,Satyanarayan Iyer,"Cheap substitutes and fake products are a real problem across sectors, and companies usually resort to raids to seize counterfeits. A team of techies based in Pune, Nitin Gupta, Yogesh Miharia and Abhishek Agarwal, have built an AI-based solution to find an affordable and efficient fix to this problem. The three, who have worked in the tech and startup sectors, founded NeuroTags in January 2017 with their saving of about $300,000. Gupta, NeuroTags’ CEO and CTO, tells TOI how his company’s technology tells the real from the fake. Edited excerpts from an interview: How does the technology work? NeuroTags provides algorithmically coupled tags, one is open and the other protected. The open tag is visible on the product and can be scanned by anyone with a smartphone to get the information about the product and its authenticity. Once a product is purchased, the buyer has access to the protected tag, which is kept inside the product seal. After scanning the protected tag, the user gets the authenticity information with certainty and the product is registered to the customer. The tags are connected, monitored and protected by algorithms and artificial intelligence on the cloud in such a way that if anyone tries to replicate the tags, it is recorded and the copied product gets invalidated. How is this technology better than existing methods like RFID tags and holograms? The problem is that existing technologies are ineffective in eliminating counterfeits and discouraging counterfeiters. RFIDs and holograms are used extensively but can be replicated easily. We have seen cases in the pharma industry where the packaging of fake medicines is as good as the real ones, including the holograms. RFID technology is expensive too. Ours is a digital solution that lets brands track their products as they travel through the supply chain and till they reach the consumer. How does your technology help the consumer? Is it just for the back-end and the brand or can a buyer track a product and check its authenticity? When the consumer scans the open tag with a smartphone, the product’s genuineness is displayed with a certain degree of detail. Other details from the manufacturer also come up — photos, videos, constituents of the product, how to use it, warranty, date of expiry. Once the protected tag is scanned, the consumer gets more details about the authenticity and the product. We also provide a way for users to communicate with the manufacturer via feedback forms. The user can also avail loyalty and referral points after scanning this tag. How many products and companies has NeuroTags tied up with? We are associated with around eight companies in various sectors in India, including Syska LED, Global Auto Implex and HyperExchange. We have one global brand on the verge of coming on board with more than a billion items a year. Five other international brands are in the sales pipeline. Is NeuroTags profitable? Not yet, but we look forward to turning profitable in a couple of years. Right now, our focus is on scaling the business. Currently, we are a team of around 18 members. Are counterfeit products a large enough problem in India for this to be a viable business model? The problem of counterfeiting is more than $1.6 trillion worldwide, as per the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition. It’s accelerating very fast, partly due to an increase in e-commerce. The counterfeiting figures in India are very high too. A study by FICCI found that 30% of automobile components in India are counterfeit. An AC Nielsen study found that 30% of FMCG business is lost to counterfeit products. That’s a large number. From toothpaste to aspirin and to high-end luxury brands, counterfeiting is everywhere. Customers are unknowingly purchasing these products, which can seriously affect their health and well-being in the long-term. For companies, counterfeiting affects the brand value and reputation. Sectors like FMCG, auto components, pharma, computer hardware, alcohol and electronics are the most affected by counterfeiting. The most dangerous, of course, is counterfeiting in the pharmaceutical industry — Assocham did a study and found that 25% of medicines available in the Indian market are fake or counterfeited. Delhi and NCR are the largest markets for fake drugs. The government is making efforts to curb counterfeits, and has introduced ‘track and trace’ technology for medicines. They’ve also decided to put all medicines on blockchain so the customer can track the journey of the medicine he is about to consume. Technology like ours will also help contain this problem.

2018-12-08,"Make use of AI to censor objectionable posts, MHA tells social media firms",Bharti Jain,"NEW DELHI: The government has asked social media companies to exercise self-censorship of objectionable content by deploying aggressive artificial intelligence-based tools to detect posts that are obscene, can generate mob frenzy or incite people to violence or terrorism . Stating that social media firms active in India deploy similar methods in the West, the Centre in its interactions with representatives of firms such as Twitter, Facebook and Google has called for replication in India of UK-based arrangements with NGOs for flagging content such as child pornography . These interactions have seen swifter compliance with requests, with action often being taken in 24 hours instead of the more common 72 hours earlier. Apart from asking for a dedicated grievance redressal officer for India, the home ministry has insisted they share identity of persons behind an objectionable post or content if a “(legal/criminal) case is made out” so that they can be prosecuted. Home secretary Rajiv Gauba has held meetings with social media platforms in June, October and November. A senior official on Friday said the sustained dialogue with social media firms has resulted in the rate of compliance with lawful requests for removal and blocking of content in India going up to around 80%.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/make-use-of-ai-to-censor-objectionable-posts-mha-tells-social-media-firms/articleshow/66996020.cms
2018-12-05,"Artificial Intelligence to help CCTV network detect crimes, mishaps",Anjaya Anparthi,"NAGPUR: The 3,698 CCTVs installed across the city under the Smart and Safe City project will soon get a ‘brain’ with Artificial Intelligence (AI). It will alert the respective police station, ambulance and hospitals in case of a major road accident at any of the city’s 665 junctions. Similarly, an alert will go out if a bag or any object is lying idle for a long time at any junction. Smart City special purpose vehicle — Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited ( NSSCDCL ) — in association with traffic police department have planned the AI initiative. Directives have been given to the project’s private operator L&T to develop AI and incorporate it in the system developed for CCTVs. L&T will be paid additional cost to be incurred for this additional work. NSSCDCL official told TOI the city will be the first to introduce AI functionality. “Detection of crimes, road accidents and traffic violations will become very easy once AI is developed,” he said. If any person or vehicle is involved in any offence or crime, the police would get all movements of the person or vehicle automatically from the CCTV feeds across the city. If a person wearing a red shirt commits a crime, a single click will show all people wearing the same coloured shirt in the particular area, so that the concerned person can be identified. NSSCDCL official added the plan is to incorporate helmet violations automatically in AI. “Any motorcyclist not wearing a helmet will be photographed by the system automatically, along with his two-wheeler, and the photo will be sent to the respective traffic police branch. Currently, this is being done manually by traffic policemen deployed at City Operation Centre developed at NMC, where CCTV feeds can be seen live,” he said. A list of police stations, traffic police branches, ambulance services, hospitals etc will be incorporated in AI to facilitate the alert mechanism. The Smart and Safe City project already comprises a couple of AI systems. Special recognition system allows police to scan a picture of any person into the system, and the person’s location can be traced whenever he appears in any of the 3,698 CCTVs. The current infrastructure also comprises of automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) and red light violation detection (RLVD). All these systems, including AI, will be monitored and controlled from City Operation Centre at NMC, and Command and Control Centre being constructed at police headquarters. Supposed to be completed by October 20, 2017, the project has been delayed due to some reasons, including addition of AI in the system. L&T will also operate and maintain the systems for five years after executing the project. CCTVs removed from 35 locations Various development projects in and around the city have forced the removal of CCTVs from 35 locations. Under Smart and Safe City project, 3,893 CCTVs were supposed to be installed at 700 locations. CCTVs were installed at given number of locations. Later, CCTVs were removed from 35 locations due to Metro Rail works, under construction flyovers on Bhandara Road and Sadar, and Kamptee Road widening project. Till completion of the works, these CCTVs cannot be re-installed, delaying the project. A NSSDCL official said the project will be inaugurated without these CCTVs. “All CCTVs will be installed as soon as the works are completed,” he said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/artificial-intelligence-to-help-cctv-network-detect-crimes-mishaps/articleshow/66944285.cms

2018-11-22,Researchers decode xenophobia using AI,Paul John,"AHMEDABAD: For the first time, the root causes of religious violence were probed by researchers using artificial intelligence (AI). Oxford University collaborated with four leading institutes and universities in the research. The study delved into two instances of xenophobic conflict — the three intense days of Godhra riots of February 2002 in Gujarat , India, and the Northern Ireland conflict which had lasted for almost three decades. The research has interpreted social conflict and cognitive psychology theories like terror management theory, social identity theory, and identity fusion theory into computer models to create an AI system which is able to mimic people’s religious feelings or belief systems, allowing scholars to better understand the conditions, triggers, as well as patterns of religious violence. The research team first programmed rules for cognitive interaction within the AI software to correlate how an individual’s beliefs match up with a group situation, both when they are least anxious and when their anxiety levels are increasing. The researchers claim that their latest computing models show how even mild events increase anxiety and eventually lead to average overall anxiety levels that can exceed a threshold and reach a tripping point. The research involved Justin Lane from the Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology, Oxford University, F LeRon Shults of the NORCE centre for modelling social systems in Norway, Ross Gore and Christopher Lynch from the Old Dominion University , US; Wesley Wildman from Boston University and Monica Duffy Toft from Tufts University in US. Oxford University’s Justin Lane in a press statement to journal Science Daily said, “Ultimately, to use AI to study religion or culture, we have to look at modelling human psychology because our psychology is the foundation for religion and culture, so the root causes of things like religious violence rest in how our minds process the information that our world presents it.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/researchers-decode-xenophobia-using-ai/articleshow/66741642.cms
2018-11-04,"India poses unique challenges for social networks, some that even artificial intelligence can’t solve",Rachel Chitra,"When a 15-year-old was trying to commit suicide on Facebook Live in Bengaluru in December last year, the social network didn’t cut the streaming mid-air. They let it go on, though they alerted the police and the friends of the teen who was self-harming. Situations such as these are tricky but Facebook made this call only after consulting with mental health professionals. “We didn’t want to escalate the situation before help reached. Cutting a person off while they are venting or expressing suicidal thoughts might be detrimental,” says Varun Reddy, public policy manager, Facebook. They managed to save the teenager, and have intervened successfully in a dozen other cases of self-harm. Facebook has a 2.2 billion user base globally, more than 200 million of that in India. It sees one billion photos being uploaded monthly. So it’s not surprising that it faces unique challenges. While some can be dealt with by using artificial intelligence (AI), others like hate speech and even humour need human watchdogs and public discussions. One hot-button issue they had to deal with in India was the video of a beheading of a Muslim in Rajasthan by one Shambhulal Regar last December. Recalling their decision to delete all videos of the incident, Reddy says, “The perpetrator gives a long hate speech at the beginning of this gruesome video. If posted without a comment, it could be interpreted as glorifying the incident. How do we allow this?” But then, news channels approached Facebook, saying this was a matter of public debate and interest. “We let them upload after editing out the most graphic parts,” says Reddy. The company says AI is good at detecting fake accounts, spam and adult nudity. Just between January and March 2018, Facebook’s AI was able to detect 99% of 583 million fake accounts before they got reported by humans, identify 100% of 837 million pieces of spam, and spot 21 million items of adult nudity and sexual activity with an accuracy rate of 96%. But in 2.5 million cases of hate speech, AI was able to spot only 38%. Sheen Handoo, public policy manager, Facebook says this is where they rely most on the FB community. India has been a constant learning curve. “For instance, globally, while we tackled racist content, it was much later that we developed the ability to combat caste slurs in India,” says Handoo, adding that Facebook constantly engages with academics and activists to ensure that the platform is on the right side of the caste debate. Today, those posting on FB will find they cannot get away with statements like “Dalits are scum” or “No bhangis allowed in this temple.” But identifying keywords like chamars and bhangis didn’t help much when it came to the surname `Chutia’. “Now, if there is a comment on FB like ‘Hi Varun Chutia’, I don’t know if that’s a real name or a slur. This is where we need human beings to give us context. And if we remove content erroneously, our doors are now open for all to appeal our decisions (earlier, the right was restricted to pages and groups),” says Handoo. Another element that AI finds difficult to categorise is humour and satire. “One of our most reported pages in India is ‘Humans of Hindutva.’ Some of their posts got taken down and they appealed. That’s when we realised that their satire wasn’t spreading hate against any community, but doing just the opposite,” says Reddy. AI often finds vernacular text a challenge. For instance, ‘chumma’ could mean ‘just like that’ in Tamil but ‘kiss’ in Hindi. “A perfectly innocuous word like ‘thambi’, meaning younger brother in Tamil, can heighten racial tension in conflict-torn Sri Lanka, where it means someone hailing from the Muslim community. So here again we rely on humans for context,” says Handoo. But algorithms can spot Hindi slurs even when people type in English. “We trained our systems to identify vernacular slurs even if these are written in a different script. Today, we’re able to support clean content in 16 Indian languages,” says Reddy. When it comes to hate speeches by politicians, Facebook takes them down if they originate on its platform. “But if the speech is made elsewhere and there are reports on it, then we permit them as it would be part of a national debate and of public interest,” says Reddy. Another issue Facebook has to tackle is code words for racist ideology like Trump’s use of euphemisms like ‘inner-city areas’ for ‘black ghettos’, or ‘globalist’ — an anti-Semitic slur used by white supremacists. “In India, the code word for sexual solicitation on the platform is escort services. And new code words are constantly evolving. So we find ourselves having to keep a close tab on cultural trends,” says Reddy.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/india-poses-unique-challenges-for-social-networks-some-that-even-artificial-intelligence-cant-solve/articleshow/66491903.cms

2018-10-27,Artificial Intelligence can hike agri production: Mande,Manka Behl,"Sudeep Kumar (from left) Scientist H of CSIR-Delhi, Shekhar Mande, CSIR director-general and Rakesh Kumar, Neeri director, at the press meet, on Friday Nagpur: For the next 10 years, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) will play a major role in implementation of Artificial Intelligence in different sectors, stated Shekhar Mande, who has recently taken over as director-general of CSIR, headquartered in New Delhi. A structural biologist, Mande completed his graduation and post-graduation from Nagpur University following which he pursued a PhD in Molecular Biophysics from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. Having worked as a scientist in Centre for DNA fingerprinting and diagnostics, Hyderabad and director of National Centre for Cell Science, Pune, Mande is the first outsider who has been appointed as director-general of CSIR since 1984. While interacting with the media during his city visit on Friday, Mande stated that Artificial Intelligence can make a big difference in the field of agriculture. “The agricultural productivity of farmers living in remote areas of the country depends on amount of rainfall, soil, seeds and other parameters. A technology like Artificial Intelligence can optimize agricultural production,” said Mande. Prominent agendas of the council will include tackling pressing environmental issues of the country. The National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri), a research institute under CSIR, has initiated cleaning and rejuvenation of Ganga river. “Till now, we were mainly studying and testing the water quality but now our focus will be on the implementation part. In six nullahs, Neeri will be using it’s in-house in situ drain cleaning treatment. The work in the first nullah will be completed by December 15,” said Rakesh Kumar, director of Neeri. In April this year, TOI was the first to report about the unique technique which uses a combination of technologies to clean the drains in a natural way. The pilot project of this technology was carried out in Nagpur. To ensure effective adoption of its technologies at a large scale, the council plans to join hands with the government. “CSIR has done a lot of fundamental work in different fields. But to make it reach to the public, a team of senior officials from the council will be preparing a list of available technologies and present it to the relevant ministers and secretaries of relevant ministries. We want to tell the government how beneficial these technologies can be for societal development,” said Mande.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/artificial-intelligence-can-hike-agri-production-mande/articleshow/66383122.cms
2018-10-26,‘AI a refinery to extract info’,Sharad Kohli,"With all that data out there, how do you make sure it’s relevant and useful for the end user? By Artificial Intelligence (AI), that’s how. “The idea behind Staqu was about processing the data,” says Atul Rai, CEO and co-founder (along with Chetan Rexwal, Anurag Saini and Pankaj Kumar Sharma) of AI startup Staqu Technologies. From recommendations (in the fashion e-commerce space) to success stories in law enforcement, Staqu is seeking to bring AI closer to people. Making sense of Big Data We are the second largest country in terms of producing data, after China. But extracting information — or meaningful information — from the data is where AI is needed. Data is image, speech and text; when you want to extract information, you have to use AI, which works on all these three. Data is becoming bigger and bigger, and fundamentally, AI is important to extract the information from this kind of big, non-linear data — for example, finding criminals from speech, image or biometrics, from FIR numbers or crime records. Otherwise, you won’t be able to make sense of the data you are collecting. So, AI is a new refinery to extract the information. The crime fighter There is big data on criminals, and these are repeat criminals — 70% of crimes are committed by repeat criminals. But how do you catch them? Of course, police is having data, though that data is offline and it is distributed — districts and states have their own records, intelligence agencies have their own records, crime branches have their own records, even the local ‘thana’ has its own records. Our idea is to integrate all these at one point. We wanted to make our AI be available to the end user, and that end user is the police constable on the ground. We are creating a new database which can match criminals from the crime scenes, (and) currently we have more than 600,000 criminals registered, in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand . To the user’s rescue You need AI to correlate content, and this helps take care of user privacy. Because, there’s a lot of content-to-content mismatch. Most of the recommendations currently in the market, they’re taking user data. Whatever you’re browsing on different kinds of platforms, they’re taking the history, and based on that they’re providing the recommendation. And I don’t see that as a recommendation, (it’s) more like keeping history, and sending it again and again, the same thing. It’s not the right recommendation, it’s just spamming the user. AI in the real world When we started in 2015, people were very sceptical about Artificial Intelligence, they thought it was just a buzzword. (But) I believe we are here in this world to do something better, not to write tags on a daily basis, on a fashion e-commerce website — it’s a repetitive job that can be done by AI. (But) the government also has to play its role in AI because data privacy will create a good support for startups here. (Also), keeping this data in India will create a good atmosphere for the AI ecosystem.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/ai-a-refinery-to-extract-info/articleshow/66370290.cms
2018-10-23,"Tea Board to go mobile, unveil AI-based app",Sovon Manna,"Kolkata: The Tea Board of India is all set to unveil an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven multilingual mobile app — pilot-named as ‘ Chai Sahay ’ — to deliver and disseminate relevant information pertaining to the industry and its stakeholders, especially less-organised small tea growers (STG). The mobile app will help monitor and inspect all tea-based projects, regulatory activities, subsidies, workshops, awareness programmes and advisories in an “easily navigable manner”. It will also multicast weather data (rainfall, sunshine, humidity, temperature) as part of its notification services and suggest suitable time for fertilizer applications on a real-time basis, says a Tea Board document. On October 10, the government-run tea watchdog started the process for hunting a technology outfit that can design, develop, host and maintain an Android-based mobile app in as many as six languages — Assamese, Bengali, English, Hindi, Malayalam and Tamil. “With the surge in smartphone use, we are keen to develop this app. It will help spread information and contact details on various activities and training sessions carried out by field officers in a faster and better manner. We are expecting to come up with the beta version of the app by this year-end,” Soumya Bhattacharya, of the IT cell of Tea Board told TOI on Monday. Functioning under the ministry of commerce and industry, the Tea Board has been implementing a number of financial assistance schemes for STGs, estate gardens and exporters. The official feels that the app will definitely come handy for the producers who are concerned over the business viability of their gardens owing to steep escalation in output cost, erratic weather and dip in price recovery. “The app will be able to advice on micro-level activities like planting, re-planting, rejuvenation, centering, tipping, level plucking, shade regulation and pest management. It will also alert estates about plucking, pruning and spraying rounds, soil sampling and weed management,” a top Tea Board official detailed. The app will incorporate existing database of STGs and introduce the registration process of new STGs via a back-end validation process. Bhattacharya added, “The small growers should be able to post queries with photographs for obtaining advisory on pest and diseases (on the app). The appmaker will also be suggested to capture the journey undertaken by a Board officer daily through a GPS-based system. All solutions will be given within 24 to 48 hours, either by auto-generated AI-based analytics or by the Board experts.” Welcoming the Tea Board initiative, Bijoygopal Chakraborty, president of the largest small tea growers’ body, Cista, said: “This will ultimately turn a small tea grower a smart farmer. It was one of our long-pending demands. Coffee growers have already benefited from such apps.” The Minimum Benchmark Price (MBP) and green leaf price will be uploaded in the app every month. The Coffee Board of India has unveiled as many as two similar AI analytics and Blockchain-driven mobile apps under ‘Coffee Connect’ initiative to provide rich info on plants’ health and solutions on farming issues such as rainfall, pests and diseases. Like the coffee apps, Chai Sahay, too, will be launched by the Union commerce and industries minister, a Tea Board source said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tea-board-to-go-mobile-unveil-ai-based-app/articleshow/66322926.cms
2018-10-06,City’s ‘Dronacharyas’ want to replace old farming methods with AI,Srikanth Godavarthi,"Hyderabad: In the United States and elsewhere, drones are seen as a fast and a cheaper solution for e-commerce giant Amazon and technology biggies like Google and Apple to deliver packages. In Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, drones are likely to be part of an answer to a much bigger problem – an increasingly acute shortage of farm labour. Agriculture in the two Telugu states is the mainstay. But it’s in trouble. Farmers are getting older. Rural incomes are low. Distress migration is high. The next generation finds farming not lucrative. The young are migrating to big metros with the hope of a better pay and a better life that probably isn’t there. As farming faces shrinking labour workforce and low rural incomes, technology players think they have an answer to improve crop management. Drone Farming In Hyderabad, AI and robotics startup Thanos believes the key to fix the problem is replace ‘human hands’ with the ‘wings of drones’. “The dwindling numbers of farm labour is a global challenge, not unique to India. Farming in the global world is increasingly getting automated by the day,” says Pradeep Palleli, founder of drone maker Thanos, an engineering grad from BITS Pilani. His drone, Pradeep, claims could cover an acre of land to air spray pesticides in less than 10 minutes while it takes an hour for 2-3 farmers to complete the same task. “Six to seven acres in an hour, 35 acres of land can be covered in a day, while it takes more than five days with large farm labour to spray pesticides manually,” says Prathyush Akepati who designs and builds aerial platforms for Thanos. The drones, to be controlled via a wireless console, can carry 5 and 10 litres of pesticides. Each of these pest-killing drones is fitted with plastic tanks to be filled with pesticides and fertilisers, 6 propellers for 5 litre drone, 4 propellers for 10 litre drone with 2 nozzles under the propellers that spray downwards. The designs can be flexible as per the requirement, says Pradeep. Expensive There is a hitch though. A drone with a capacity to carry five-litre pesticide can cost Rs 4 lakh, while a 10-litre drone could be priced at Rs 6 lakh. It’s frightfully expensive, not a small investment for marginal farmers. “These drones are worth the price for the amount of time and effort they save. They save labour, cost and time,” contends Pradeep. Thanos drones have been tested in the farmlands of Srikakulam in North Andhra and some districts in Telangana. The drones have been demonstrated in several expos in Vizag, Hyderabad and Maharashtra. Regulations There is another hitch. Currently, drones cannot fly not at least in urban cities. Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had imposed a slew of regulations, including curbs on flying drones near airports, they cannot fly in the night, most importantly cannot be used for hazardous material. Thanos is waiting for December for a greater clarity on guidelines. Pradeep hopes the Telangana and AP governments create a favourable ecosystem for startups in AI and Internet of Things (IoT) space. Once that happens, Thanos drones could soon be buzzing around the farm lands of Telangana and AP to replace manual labour by automated farming. The pesticide spraying drone, Prathyush Akepati, says will reach where human workforce cannot. “In paddy fields, for instance, the drone can reach inside the crop where a farmer cannot due to water-logging. Our pesticide spraying drones go where tractors can’t,” he explains. Buy Or Rent-A-Drone Thanos is working on two models to monetize their drones --- one way is by sale of drones to corporates and agri companies and the other model is to offer drone spraying as a service per acre as majority of farmers may not able to afford the cost of drones. “The farmer doesn’t need to buy a drone as they may not fully utilise it since spraying is a seasonal activity. We are looking at offering per acre service. The farmer doesn’t need to worry how the drone operates. Currently, our drones are not operational but whenever farmers need a drone, all they need to do is make a call on our customer number and set up an appointment for our team to air spray pesticides. The pricing hasn’t yet been worked out, but could be cheaper in some areas where wages are higher,” contends Prathyush. Displace jobs? Some would complain that automated machines and newer technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) are displacing people of their jobs. “The technology is born because there is a shortage of farm labour. Besides, humans are not supposed to spray pesticides as the toxic exposure is hazardous to health. Farmers develop respiratory problems by inhaling the chemicals, it even causes temporary blindness,” argues Prathyush. Recently, in Maharashtra’s Yavatmal 20 farm workers died of exposure to spraying pesticides. Across India, several thousands of workers lose their lives to pesticide exposure. However, conventional thinkers may not like drones replacing the humans, but that is a harsh reality they may have to live with. But for now, the bug-zapping drones will hover over farmlands to air spray pesticides if not today, tomorrow.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/citys-dronacharyas-want-to-replace-old-farming-methods-with-ai/articleshow/66092502.cms
2018-10-06,The ‘whiz kid’ from Wayanad smitten by Artificial Intelligence,Disney Tom,"Jaiden John Bose KOCHI: Standing behind a tall table at the Cyberdome pavilion at Cocon-XI, Jaiden John Bose convincingly explained the functioning of a software in development, which could detect riders without helmet using cameras. Jaiden, has already earned the title ‘wonder boy’ at the Cyber Conference in Kochi as visitors are taken aback when he identifies himself as a 14-year-old from Wayanad. It was at the age of eight that Jaiden became curious about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and for the past six months, he has devoted most of his time to in-depth research in the field. “I was taking computer courses in web development when I turned eight and I wanted to do something different. I googled for futuristic ideas and soon stumbled upon AI,” said Jaiden. Jaiden, along with his partner Navneet K T has been developing a software, Motor Cycle Safety Analyser (MCSA), and are hopeful of handing it over free to the Kerala police with in a period of few months. Jaiden, who had joined Cyberdome earlier this year, while responding to an ad seeking volunteers, met his partner Navneet, an undergraduate student, in a WhatsApp group of cyberdome volunteers. “We were talking about Machine Learning in the group and texted each other privately. Later, we met up during a cyber conference in Kozhikode. We then come up with the MCSA project,” says Jaiden. Jaiden went to CBSE school till 8th and is now homeschooled. “I was attending regular classes till 8th and now I study under the National Institute of Open Schooling. It gives me more time to focus on my projects and other research,” he said. He says that his parents are fully supporting him. “I am getting full support from Cyberdome as well,” said Jaiden. Jaiden said he is also working on a research project on AI-enabled cancer detection, which he wants to submit to to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The software would help early detection of cancer in rural areas where treatment is not easily accessible. Navneet KT, Jaiden’s partner said they coordinate over phone. “I knew he was talented but I didn’t know he was this small,” said Navneet with a chuckle. Jaiden says that people are surprised that he is soyoung. “I have been attending conferences but it is the first time at Cocon. I am quite excited about being here,” he said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/the-whiz-kid-from-wayanad-smitten-by-ai/articleshow/66093855.cms

2018-09-16,Artificial intelligence tech used in stability test for Kolkata Gate,Suman Chakraborti,"KOLKATA: A US-based startup has started testing the stability of the Kolkata Gate’s ring in New Town using artificial intelligence (AI) and internet-of things (IOT) technology that monitors natural vibrations and deflections. Last year, a spherical structure with the Biswa Bangla logo fixed to the Kolkata Gate fell from a height of 40 metres. Since then, the authorities have been looking into all safety aspects of the entire structure, which has a hanging restaurant at the top. Officials said that there is no plan right now to re-attach the globe to the Kolkata Gate. Last week, the startup representatives met senior officials of Hidco . “For the moment, the firm has been asked to conduct tests on the Haldiram’s flyover and on the ring of the Kolkata Gate. The firm may be engaged to conduct surveys of other elevated structures in the township if the demonstration is effective,” said an official. Hidco officials said that special gyroscopic sensors have been fixed on the ring to measure the natural vibrations while vehicular movement occurs nearby. The sensors will then feed the data into a computer. Officials added that the natural vibration rate of the ring has been picking up towards the night. “This may be due to heavy goods vehicles passing by the spot more during the night. The experts will come up with an idea as to what should be the normal vibration rate for the ring,” said a Hidco official. The authorities want to ensure that the structure has the stability to take the pressure after the restaurant opens to the public. “It will be a continuous monitoring process to ensure the safety of the ring,” said a Hidco official.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/artificial-intelligence-tech-used-in-stability-test-for-kolkata-gate/articleshow/65825996.cms
2018-09-15,AI-based system to forecast flood in Chennai week in advance,U Tejonmayam,"CHENNAI: When the sluices of Chembarambakkam reservoir were opened following heavy rain in December 2015, there was no warning from the authorities and the residents had no clue a devastating flood was on its way. This monsoon, artificial intelligence may play a crucial role in keeping the city better prepared. That’s when C-Flows or Chennai Flood Warning System, which can forecast flooding five days to a week in advance, will be put to test. Developed by scientists from National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), it will give authorities sufficient time to plan evacuation. Integrated with numerical models, this GIS-based decision support system will be able to forecast flooding in any locality, ward, street or even building in the city along with evacuation routes. To run the model, scientists require data on weather, surge and tide prediction, hydrology condition, water levels and discharge from rivers and reservoirs apart from basic information on the topography including elevation, moisture and drainage condition. In about 30 minutes to an hour, authorities will get an output in the form of maps, texts and numbers, some of them in 3D visual formats. ""We are in the process of signing an MoU with the state government, and C-Flows will be operated in test mode this northeast monsoon. The prediction from the system will be validated with data collected from the field,"" said NCCR director MV Ramanamurthy. C-Flows comes with a database of more than 700 flood situations based on rainfall for various return periods, tidal conditions, etc. Once data on weather forecast and tide is fed, the system will pick the most relevant situation. Inundation models will also run on a real-time basis to simulate the ground situation based on actual datasets from IMD and NCMRWF, INCOIS. According to NCCR, Chennai is more vulnerable to floods than cities like Bengaluru. ""Compared to Goa and Bengaluru the elevation in Chennai is less. So, water cannot drain into the sea fast. When it rains heavy during high tide, water cannot evaporate and will flood laterally into the land. Adding to this, high precipitation and release of water from reservoirs make the city vulnerable to floods,"" he explained. C-Flows is a culmination of the project initiated by the office of the principal scientific advisor to the Centre and institutes like IIT-B, IIT-M, IRS-Anna University, NCMRWF and IMD. It will be made operational along with the TN government next year. Tune Usha of NCCR said output was validated using more than 400 field points collected during the 2015 flood when NCCR teams mapped flood levels from various parts of the city. ""A mobile-based app has also been developed as a part of the system where the official in-charge of a ward can go to the field, click images and geotag them in the app. This information will be made available online to the city’s administrators table,"" she said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ai-based-system-to-forecast-flood-in-city-week-in-advance/articleshow/65814959.cms
2018-09-13,"Artificial Intelligence will only complement human effort, not supplant it: Adobe CEO",Srikanth Godavarthi,"HYDERABAD: When Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen was a student at Hyderabad Public School here, sailing, sports, debating, theatre and journalism occupied his mind, but there was no career in them. Today, he is “amazed” by the country’s transformation. “If I was a young person growing up in India today, who knows, the path I took might have been very different,” he told TOI in an interview. Narayen is most impressed by the progress “in the business and technology climate.” He said the world is watching how Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s initiatives are building a digital-first economy, and Adobe “remains committed to delivering the latest innovation for Indians.” The company recently signed an agreement with the ministry of skill development to give a million students access to Adobe Spark, a tool for creating high-quality graphics, web pages and video stories. “On the enterprise side, some of India’s biggest brands, including SpiceJet, MakeMyTrip, Flipkart, Taj Group, Airtel, Idea Cellular , and IDFC Bank , are partnering with Adobe for their own digital transformation journeys.” Like Google, Amazon and Microsoft, Adobe is also focusing on artificial intelligence (AI) to make its tools more useful, but unlike Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who regards AI with foreboding, Narayen says it will only complement human effort, not supplant it. “We firmly believe that technologies like AI will amplify — not replace — human creativity... There’s no substitute for brilliant ideas, a compelling story or a creative spark. AI won’t replace the distinct touch that only a human can bring to the art we create and the work we do.” Adobe has its own digital assistant called Sensei to automate routine tasks so that users can focus on ideation and creating. Soon, India will play a role in Adobe’s AI development as the company recently announced plans to set up an advanced AI lab in Hyderabad. At present, it has campuses in Noida and Bengaluru. While India is one of Adobe’s important markets where, Narayen says, it will continue to invest, the Telugu states — Telangana and Andhra Pradesh — have caught its attention because of their aggressive ‘ease of doing business’ pitch. “I’m thrilled to see what minister K T Rama Rao has been doing to promote technology in Telangana and push an entrepreneurial and innovation-friendly agenda. We’re excited to partner with state agencies to bring technologies like Adobe Sign to market and improve the way organisations conduct business.” When Narayen took his masters in computer science from Bowling Green State University, Ohio, and founded the world’s first image sharing site, Pictra, the US was a very welcoming place. As one of Silicon Valley’s top executives today, what does he think of the recent tough immigration policies in the US and the UK? “As an immigrant, US citizen, and CEO of a US company, I am a direct beneficiary of an open, progressive immigration policy,” he said. “Welcoming people from all countries, religions and cultures is not only a hallmark of American values but is critical for our country’s future innovation and economic success. Adobe would not be the company it is today without our rich diversity of employees, and that continued diversity is vital to our future.” Diversity is also a must for cricket fans like Narayen to continue reminding their USborn friends “that cricket is baseball done right.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ai-will-only-complement-human-effort-not-supplant-it-adobe-ceo/articleshow/65791107.cms
2018-09-03,Artificial intelligence system helps successfully treat cancer patient,PTI,"SINGAPORE: In a first, scientists have used a powerful artificial intelligence (AI) platform, to successfully treat a patient with advanced cancer, completely halting disease progression. The research team successfully utilised a platform called CURATE.AI to continuously identify the optimal doses of each drug to result in a durable response, allowing the patient to resume a completely normal and active lifestyle. The patient with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (MCRPC) was given a novel drug combination consisting of investigational drug ZEN-3694 and enzalutamide, an approved prostate cancer drug. ""Dynamic dosing in cancer therapy is not commonly used. In fact, drug dosing changes in oncology are typically performed only to reduce toxicity,"" said Dean Ho, from National University of Singapore (NUS). ""CURATE.AI uniquely modifies drug dosing to increase efficacy. Our clinical study has shown that dosing can profoundly affect the efficacy and safety of treatment,"" said Ho, who led the study published in the journal Advanced Therapeutics. Combination therapy represents a cornerstone in modern cancer treatment. Using this approach, multiple drugs are used to attack the processes that support cancer growth. A primary objective when designing combination therapies is to achieve drug synergy, where the drugs work together to substantially improve efficacy. While combination therapy has generally improved treatment outcomes such as overall survival for many cancers, it is predominantly given at both fixed as well as high doses. The CURATE.AI platform uses the patient's own clinical data — such as their drug doses and corresponding changes to tumour sizes or levels of cancer biomarkers in the blood — to calibrate their unique response to treatment. This calibration is then used to create an individualised CURATE.AI profile, or map, that identifies the drug doses which enable the best possible treatment outcome at any given point in time. ""No two patients' profiles are alike, and as a patient's body and the cancer itself evolve during treatment, the CURATE.AI profile evolves as well, enabling the clinical and engineering teams to optimise care for the entire duration of treatment, an unprecedented advance for combination therapy,"" Ho said. The patient with metastatic prostate cancer was given ZEN-3694 and enzalutamide. Reducing the level of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the patient's blood served as the primary biomarker to determine if the patient was responding to treatment. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the cancer lesions monitored the extent of disease progression. ""Using CURATE.AI to dynamically modify drug doses and successfully treat a metastatic cancer patient represents a landmark breakthrough for the use of AI to truly personalise patient care,"" said Ho.

2018-08-24,Maharashtra colleges to start robotics course designed by IIT,Yogita Rao,"Image used for representational purpose only MUMBAI: The state government will for the first time help colleges start placement-oriented courses in cyber security, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics , product design, among others. Autonomous colleges can offer these interdisciplinary subjects as electives in their curriculum, while others can launch them as value-added courses. Also, an impact study will be done for the first time to understand benefits of the courses on campus placements . The state will conduct a baseline study on campus placements in some colleges this year to understand average salaries drawn, kind of skill sets required by industries and other details. The data will be compared with placement reports at those colleges a year after the courses’ introduction, to understand the impact, said Meeta Rajiv Lochan, the state’s project director for Rashtriya Uchchatar Shikshan Abhiyan (RUSA). The tailor-made courses of 70-300 hours will be offered to students from second and third year of undergraduate programmes. The state has organised workshops in specialised job-oriented courses for engineering and pharmacy colleges, along with arts, science and commerce colleges. “Companies spend a lot in retraining fresh graduates. These courses will increase the efficiency of placements. AI and deep learning will be pervasive in future. All job profiles will require deep learning and machine learning at some level. It is being used in humanities too,” said Priyanka Sharma from Nirma University. She added that industries have started conversational AI too. For students from computer science background, the AI course will span over 75-80 hours, but for those from arts and commerce backgrounds, colleges may have to include 75-80 hours more to train students in basic applied mathematics. The robotics programme, open for science and engineering colleges, will require a little investment in a lab, said Kavi Arya, professor, IIT-B . The institute is helping setting up labs across colleges in the country under a central government initiative. Another resource person who attended the workshop said colleges can choose modules. “They can add or delete topics. Nasscom has designed qualification packs for 11 topics. Cyber security and network security will generate hundreds of jobs on campuses,” she said. St Xavier’s College plans to offer robotics and geographical information system (GIS). Principal-designate Rajendra Shinde said they may modify course content and offer them as electives. The college will also look at courses such as capital market for commerce (night shift) students. HR College has shortlisted cyber security and GIS. “Since our college is not autonomous, we will have to offer them as value-added courses. Students will have to attend courses and lectures. We will work out modalities soon,” said principal Parag Thakker.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/colleges-to-start-robotics-course-designed-by-iit/articleshow/65521997.cms
2018-08-19,AI system could make lip sync dubbing accurate,PTI,"NEW DELHI: Scientists have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can edit the facial expressions of actors to accurately match dubbed voices, saving time and reducing costs for the film industry. Deep Video Portraits, developed by researchers including those from Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Germany and Stanford University in the US can also be used to correct gaze and head pose in video conferencing and enables new possibilities for video postproduction and visual effects. Unlike previous methods that are focused on movements of the face interior only, Deep Video Portraits can also animate the whole face including eyes, eyebrows, and head position in videos, using controls known from computer graphics face animation. It can even synthesise a plausible static video background if the head is moved around. ""It works by using model-based 3D face performance capture to record the detailed movements of the eyebrows, mouth, nose, and head position of the dubbing actor in a video,"" said Hyeongwoo Kim from the University of Bath in the UK. ""It then transposes these movements onto the 'target' actor in the film to accurately sync the lips and facial movements with the new audio,"" said Kim. The research is currently at the proof-of-concept stage and is yet to work at real time, however, the researchers anticipate the approach could make a real difference to the visual entertainment industry. ""Despite extensive post-production manipulation, dubbing films into foreign languages always presents a mismatch between the actor on screen and the dubbed voice,"" said Christian Theobalt, from the Max Planck Institute for Informatics. ""Our new Deep Video Portrait approach enables us to modify the appearance of a target actor by transferring head pose, facial expressions, and eye motion with a high level of realism,"" said Theobalt. ""This technique could also be used for post-production in the film industry where computer graphics editing of faces is already widely used in today's feature films,"" said Christian Richardt, from the University of Bath. A great example is 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' where the face of Brad Pitt was replaced with a modified computer graphics version in nearly every frame of the movie. This work remains a very time-consuming process, often requiring many weeks of work by trained artists. The approach can also be used in other applications, which the authors show on their project website, for instance in video and VR teleconferencing, where it can be used to correct gaze and head pose such that a more natural conversation setting is achieved. The software enables many new creative applications in visual media production, but the authors are also aware of the potential of misuse of modern video editing technology.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/ai-system-could-make-lip-sync-dubbing-accurate/articleshow/65459444.cms

2018-08-13,AI system can adjust dosage to make chemo less toxic,PTI,"BOSTON : MIT researchers have developed an artificial intelligence system that can help reduce toxic chemotherapy dosing for the most aggressive form of brain cancer, potentially improving the quality of life for patients. Glioblastoma is a malignant tumour that appears in the brain or spinal cord, and prognosis for adults is no more than five years. Patients must endure radiation therapy and multiple drugs taken every month. These strong pharmaceuticals cause debilitating side effects in patients. Researchers from MIT in the US detail a model that could make dosing regimens less toxic but still effective. Powered by a “self-learning” machinelearning technique, the model looks at treatment regimens currently in use, and iteratively adjusts the doses. Eventually, it finds an optimal treatment plan, with the lowest possible potency and frequency of doses that should still reduce tumour sizes to a degree comparable to that of traditional regimens. In simulated trials of 50 patients, the model designed treatment cycles that reduced the potency to a quarter or half of nearly all the doses while maintaining the same tumour-shrinking potential. Many times, it skipped doses altogether, scheduling administrations only twice a year instead of monthly.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/ai-system-can-adjust-dosage-to-make-chemo-less-toxic/articleshow/65381382.cms

2018-07-25,IIT-Hyderabad develops AI-enabled software to catch bike riders without helmet,Preeti Biswas,"HYDERABAD: Artificial intelligence (AI) may soon help lawenforcing agencies crackdown on people riding without a helmet in the city. Researchers at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Hyderabad, have developed an AI-enabled detection system which will identify motorcyclists driving without helmet, using CCTV network of traffic police, in real time. After a two-year effort, a team of three researchers — associate professor Krishna Mohan, his students Dinesh Singh and C Vishnu — has developed a software to detect people riding without helmets. The researchers accessed traffic data of the city’s CCTV network to develop the software, which will help police identify violators. “Using video surveillance (CCTV nework), the software will identify riders driving without helmet and send out an alert to the control room within 10-11 milliseconds. Subsequently, the software, connected with RTA database, will be able to generate challans and send out an SMS,” explained Mohan, adding how it would reduce human interface in nabbing such violators on evidence basis. The researchers used machine learning and AI techniques to develop the software, which would be partially installed in CCTV cameras along with an embedded card in respective servers. The technology was tested by the researchers at IIT-Hyderabad and some traffic junctions, wherein it threw up positive results. Violators can be identified in real time The software is capable of identifying violators in real time . We have filed a patent for the software. Also, we are awaiting third party tie-ups to make it commercially available to be installed at junctions, toll booths etc.,” Mohan added. The institute has also held discussions with Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar to make it feasible for the traffic network in the city. Researchers claim the technology could be extended to other traffic violations as well. “The technology can be extended to other violations such as wrong-side driving, triple riding, speeding, zigzag driving etc. We hope it will reduce traffic violations in future,” Mohan said. The team has also filed two separate patents for software which will detect chain-snatchers and accidents.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iit-hyderabad-develops-ai-enabled-software-to-catch-bike-riders-without-helmet/articleshow/65126720.cms

Ambani said the company has been a disruptor in the telecom space. “It is my firm belief that in the next two or three decades, we as a civilisation will achieve more than what it has achieved in the last 100 years,” said Ambani. Ambani said we are in the age of super intelligence - machine intelligence, artificial intelligence. “Many say that machine learning is evil as it will replace humans. In my opinion, machines can prove highly beneficial. We will not be seeking to replace human effort; but to amplify it with intelligence,” he said. He noted that some of the early work on AI was around recognising human speech and understanding the nuances of language. “This meant that we could help people who are illiterate, learning challenged or not conversant with English,” he said. Ambani said AI could be particularly useful for school children. “In a class room setting every one faces the same experience; but we learn differently, we learn at different paces. With AI, it is now possible to pace the delivery of learning, to adapt it, so that it is best suited to the individual learning pace.

2018-07-19,Be intelligent about AI or perish,"Jul 19, 2018, 08:26 IST","Automation capability of AI is scaring a lot of people, but its adoption can happen only when society sees tangible benefits from it, writes academician TV Mohandas Pai Move over spreadsheet warriors, artificial intelligence (AI) is here. In an increasingly digitised economy, managing requires more than simple number crunching. The connected world is producing a lot of data for humans to handle and AI is becoming a necessity for managing business and innovation. Inevitably, managers must learn to work with AI in order to perform in the new world. Connected computing and communication devices have become ubiquitous and, according to McKinsey, these devices are producing more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day; and about 90% of the data in the world has been produced in the past couple of years. A vast majority of humanity has already become dependent on digital devices, services and everybody is creating vast data footprints. Acquiring, storing and transferring data is becoming progressively easier, faster and cheaper and that is allowing automation of even thinking. According to Google’s Sundar Pichai , AI will do more for humanity than what fire or electricity have done. So, no manager can do without some AI knowledge and skills. AI is essentially about using machines to learn from raw information and automating actions and predictions. Broadly, there are two levels of machine intelligence — machine learning and deep learning — and today’s managers need to understand when and how to apply either or both. Machine learning involves creating algorithms that can turn raw data into patterns, predictions and prescriptions. The most common applications of machine learning are recommendations made by digital services to customers based on their expressed interests and past consumption. Deep learning is about creating a network of algorithms to process greater volume and variety of data and solve more complex problems. It is being applied in face recognition, translation, diagnosing diseases, controlling driverless cars etc. The AI is also changing the way people experience business and products. Augmented Reality (AR), a branch of AI, is enabling digitally-assisted performance of complex tasks, such as face recognition, product trials, translation and autonomous driving. In the US, Uber has deployed a face recognition system to allow its drivers to sign in at work by taking a selfie. The education sector is set to be transformed by AI. The world is gradually getting used to online learning using text and videos but with virtual reality and AR, it would be possible to create virtual classrooms and laboratories. Now, AI can read and understand handwriting, thanks to the computer vision technology, and many startups are using it to build apps for education. For example, now there are apps that can evaluate written tests and assignments based on patterns from teachers’ evaluation. Helpfully, managers do not have to learn AI from the scratch. There are many data and machine learning platforms such as Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services , which offer data analytics and AI development services to others. For many CEOs, the chief attraction of AI is reducing labour cost and speeding up operations. However, the greatest value of AI is in creating value through innovation. The automation capability of AI is scaring a lot of people but AI adoption can happen only when the larger part of the society sees tangible benefits from it.

2018-06-25,"AI students steam ahead powered by open access libraries, online courses",Ardhra Nair,"PUNE: When schools treat computer science as a just another subject, curious students like Atharva Joshi find it boring and look at learning that runs deeper. Joshi’s passion to know why the CPU acts like the brain of the computer led him to spend hours on the internet. Soon he discovered computer languages and learned C, C++, Java and Python. In January, he was ranked first in an international competition by YouTube for code-breakers. With the world wide web hosting open access libraries and the advent of low-cost internet in the country, more and more students are taking up programming and coding lessons including machine learning and deep learning courses which eventually help them make algorithms for Artificial Intelligence . “When I realized that the school syllabus won’t teach me what I wanted to know, I started learning C language from online free tutorials. Soon, I learned the next level which is C++, Java and finally Python. I started writing algorithms in Python and that is when this competition came up. It was on data structures and algorithms which I cracked and got one lakh credit points to learn courses in an online portal,” Joshi said. He is a standard XII student of Deeksha College and wants to study engineering and set up his own company to solve society’s problems. Ashish S, an IT professional, is also learning AI via various open courses available online. Ashish, who never had a science background, is in fact hooked to Python and subsequently machine learning. “Once I started reading up about technology, I was fascinated by it. So much can be done with just programming. I started making programs of my own. Soon, I read about AI and now I am into deep learning and machine learning,” said Ashish. Shripad Tak, a second year MSc student at Symbiosis Institute of Computer Studies and Research also trawls the internet to understand the world of artificial intelligence. “Data scientists are well-paid, hence more students are getting into ML-DL,” said Tak. Shripad, who is an avid football fan, realized that AI can be used to predict the way players are exchanged among clubs, there value, their play and so on. “In any model, gathering data takes 70% of the time. This may include how many goals the footballer has scored, against which country or club, his previous transfers, the games he has played and so on. There is so much data that we need to cleanse it as per our needs. Then we make models through which we run this data and anything that gives us a result above 75% accuracy is a good model for prediction,” he said. Shripad spoke about a student he met who was using AI to predict how much revenue a film will generate once released. “For this, he had taken up elaborate data including minute details such as likes and dislikes the teaser of the film received, the views it had, the negative and positive comments and so on. The important feature is that you need to visualize everything before even attempting to write the program,” Shripad added. The students who are into ML-DL make their own projects eventually uploading them on online platforms. There are also various hackathons organized by software companies and others where the students can test their skills and these are taken seriously by the employers. “The employers nowadays want to see your work. So in an interview you can actually show the projects that you have launched on these platforms and also certificates from hackathons that you have participated. Hence, when it comes to data sciences, a degree may or may not be important. What matters are your skills and your projects,” Ashish said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ai-students-steam-ahead-powered-by-open-access-libraries-online-courses/articleshow/64725029.cms

Lt Gen Srivastava was delivering a keynote address at the second national conference on advances in armament technology (NCAAT), organised by the Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE) here. “To fight future wars, whatever weapon systems we are developing today should be equipped with AI and robotics. To achieve this, we need to have scientists with deep understanding of technology and war history and also technology-savvy soldiers,” he said. The armament cluster needs to change its traditional strategy of developing only weapons. “We can’t have a weapon which is fitted with other supporting systems. To get the desired result, we need to develop the entire weapon system with its own dedicated system. The cluster needs to work in this direction,” he said. Commenting on the quality, he said, “Whatever weapon and ammunitions are being developed by the cluster should retain the best quality and meet all types of requirement such as weather, terrain, etc.” Lt Gen Srivastava advised the armament scientists to integrate themselves with the troops of the Indian Army and urged them to visit forward line posts, including in high altitude areas. “This endeavour will certainly help the scientists to understand what type of weapon systems need to be developed for the troops,” he added. Last year, the indigenously developed Dhanush and the United States’ M- 777 ultralight howitzers faced issues during trials at Pokharan in Rajasthan. “In the past, we couldn’t pinpoint whether there were issues with the gun’s barrel system or ammunition. But this time, our team of experts fired thousand rounds of ammunition. And, they have been able to find out the exact cause of the problem,” Lt Gen Srivastava said.

2018-06-03,Artificial intelligence device to record patient heart history at KGMU,Shailvee Sharda,"Representative image LUCKNOW: Keeping in mind the high burden of heart patients, authorities at King George's Medical University are looking at installation of artificial intelligence-based patient triage technology (AIPTT) kiosks in the out-patient department. This intelligent touch-screen interface, comparable to the online check-in kiosks at airports, will help patients record the nature of problem faced by them, thereby saving about 40% of doctors' time. A team of doctors and representatives from technology companies including one from California visited KGMU on Saturday to study the needs of the institution. The system is being successfully used in some developed countries. In the cardiology department, a single doctor is expected to attend to 400-500 patients everyday. The average number of patients seen by the nine faculty members, including the HoD, is 1.2 lakh per year. ""AIPTT is a technology that works on algorithms wherein the work of taking patient history would be done by an intelligent machine. With the inputs given, the machine would analyse the information to make a suggested diagnosis and treatment protocol. This alone would save about 30% of time a doctor spends on a patient to take history. The action would be evaluated and finalised by a doctor,"" explained Amit Khare, who made a presentation on behalf of his company. Besides cardiology, such kiosks would come up at the orthopaedics department. Head of cardiology department Prof VS Narain had announced the installation of the system during the department's 41st foundation day in May. However, officials at KGMU made it clear that the university had permitted installation only on trial basis for research.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/artificial-intelligence-device-to-record-patient-heart-history-at-kgmu/articleshow/64433430.cms

2018-05-28,"Tech executives pick IoT, artificial intelligence most to upskill",Rupali Mukherjee,"MUMBAI: As job disruption intensifies due to adoption of next-gen technology, Internet of things ( IoT ) and artificial intelligence ( AI ) have emerged as the most sought-after courses for upskilling among mid-level and even senior executives. Technology professionals from all experience levels are going in for reskilling driven by digitisation, the need to stay relevant and for job security. AI and IoT are, therefore, the hottest skills to acquire for 2018, as well as the fastest growing, according to research shared exclusively with TOI by Edureka , an online learning company that offers over 100 courses in trending technologies. Even hiring data suggests new technology trends such as AI, blockchain and cyber-security will sweep the market off conventional skills. AI, which seems to be becoming a mainstay in almost every form of technology, is going to pop up in all new platforms, devices or apps more and more through 2018, with over 50% firms implementing AI in their products, says a survey by Nasscom . In an analysis of responses from a learner base of 17,000 across geographies, Edureka witnessed an increase of over 100% (in learners) for AI course in the last six months, while IoT showed an astronomical spurt of 200%. Though introduced in April, Edureka had earlier perceived a strong demand for the course’s videos on its YouTube channel. HR experts have emphasised the need for reskilling in 2018-19, but few IT employers have invested in upskilling their existing talent. However, professionals from all industries and experience levels want to stay ahead of the curve and are opting for it. Though mid-management professionals form the biggest chunk across technology categories, senior executives and CXOs are also opting to embellish their skills.More than 50% of learners have over 10 years of experience, while the IT-software industry has the biggest chunk of professionals upskilling with AI (77%) at the top. Surprisingly, banking and financial services sector is at second place (8.6%), with all other industries trailing behind, the survey said. “The way of doing everything is dramatically changing. India is right in the middle of this storm because it has the largest pool of an aspiring young force, which is trying to stay current with the change. Its mid-management is trying to reskill so that they are not left on the roadside when this change becomes a tsunami. It also has the largest consumer population, which people want to analyse, understand and target. Thus, organisations are seeking professionals who can help them get ahead of the curve,” says Vineet Nayar, former CEO of HCL Technologies. Learners look for courses that will prepare them for a career track and future-proof their career while giving them flexibility, plenty of hands-on experience and access to technology upgrades. Vineet Chaturvedi, co-founder of Edureka, which has trained over 6,00,000 learners in the last six years, says, “A combination of skills is recommended for tech professionals looking to fast-track their career growth. A core skill, which is in demand, also needs to be augmented with upgrades and upcoming skills and this is the learning trend we have observed too.” A similar trend has been witnessed across other learning platforms too. Kashyap Dalal, co-founder and chief business officer of Simplilearn, says, “Organisations are seeking employees armed with specialised tech skills in these domains (AI and machine learning) and it’s great to see IT professionals building careers where the growth is. At Simplilearn, AI and machine learning have become one of the fastest growing categories and we’ve witnessed a 300% spike each in our learner base over the last year.” Bengaluru leads in the global demand for reskilling, followed by Hyderabad and Chennai, which is also reflective of location of industries the learners belong to.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tech-execs-pick-iot-ai-most-to-upskill/articleshow/64346229.cms

2018-05-28,New AI system can identify people from their walk,PTI,"LONDON: Scientists have developed an artificial intelligence ( AI ) system that can identify people by measuring their gait or walking pattern. The technology could be used at airport security instead of fingerprinting and eye-scanning. It can successfully verify an individual simply by analysing the footstep 3D and time-based data. The AI system, developed by researchers at University of Manchester in the UK and University of Madrid in Spain , correctly identified an individual almost 100% of the time, with just a 0.7 error rate. Physical biometrics, such as fingerprints, facial recognition and retinal scans, are currently more commonly used for security purposes. “Each human has approximately 24 different factors and movements when walking, resulting in every individual person having a unique, singular walking pattern. Therefore monitoring these movements can be used, like a fingerprint or retinal scan, to recognise and clearly identify or verify an individual,” said Omar Costilla Reyes , from University of Manchester. One the key benefits of using footprint recognition is, unlike being filmed or scanned at an airport, the process is non-intrusive for the individual and resilient to noise environmental conditions.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/new-ai-system-can-identify-people-from-their-walk/articleshow/64349074.cms
2018-05-21,India now wants artificial intelligence-based weapon systems,Rajat Pandit,"NEW DELHI: Humanoid robots, armed with lethal weapons, to guard the long borders with Pakistan and China? Or, unmanned tanks, submarines and aircraft to take the battle to the enemy? Well, all this as of now may be in the realm of pure science fiction for India, which does not even have aerial combat drones. But India does not want to miss the bus in the new global arms race to develop artificial intelligence(AI)-powered weapon and surveillance systems for futuristic wars. The country's defence establishment is now working towards harnessing the expertise of the information technology industry and academia in this arena, taking a cue from countries like the US and China that are focusing on AI and MI (machine learning) to develop lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS). The critical need to be prepared for this new revolution in military affairs was even stressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the DefExpo in Chennai last month. ""New and emerging technologies like AI and Robotics will perhaps be the most important determinants of defensive and offensive capabilities for any defence force in the future. India, with its leadership in information technology domain, would strive to use this technology tilt to its advantage,"" he said. But it will take a lot of doing. The government is banking on a multi-stakeholder taskforce, which was set up in February, to formulate a concrete strategy and framework for ""employment of AI for national security and defence needs"" in the years ahead. ""The world is moving towards AI-driven warfare. India is also taking necessary steps to prepare our armed forces because AI has the potential to have a transformative impact on national security. The government has set up the AI taskforce to prepare the roadmap for it,"" said Union defence production secretary Ajay Kumar, speaking exclusively to TOI. The 17-member taskforce, which is headed by Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran and includes national cyber security coordinator Gulshan Rai, IIT and IISc professors as well as two and three-star generals and representatives from ISRO, DRDO and Atomic Energy Commission, is working on the roadmap with several goals in mind. They range from ""establishing tactical deterrence in the region and visualizing potential transformative weaponry"" to ""developing intelligent, autonomous robotic systems and bolstering cyber defence"". ""The taskforce will make recommendations on how to make India a significant power in AI, in terms of both offensive and defensive needs, especially in aviation, naval, land systems, cyber, nuclear and biological warfare arenas. Initial tenders or RFIs (requests for information) will be floated over the next two years on dual-use AI capabilities,"" said an official. Concurrently, DRDO's Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR) is also trying to develop different kinds of intelligent robots, but clearly much more needs to be done. India, of course, also needs to take cognizance of the entire ethical debate on LAWS because critics argue they could violate humanitarian principles by having the capability to autonomously select and destroy targets without human intervention.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-moves-to-develop-ai-based-military-systems/articleshow/64250232.cms
2018-05-07,Punjab National Bank relies on artificial intelligence to check frauds,TNN,"NEW DELHI: Punjab National Bank on Sunday said it plans to rely on artificial intelligence (AI) for reconciliation of accounts and incorporate analytics for improving audit systems as it seeks to clean up the process after the massive fraud involving Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi . The bank has already initiated a number of steps and now intends to firmly put behind memories of the over Rs 20,000 crore swindle by the diamond merchants by targeting an 11% growth in business during the current financial year. The bank discussed the road map, where the target is to increase total business to Rs 12 lakh crore, including a Rs 1 lakh crore or 13.7% increase in low-cost current and savings account deposits, it said in a statement. PNB managing director Sunil Mehta has maintained that the bank's business was not impacted by the scam, which was limited to the Brady House branch in Mumbai. ""The 'business remodelling' brought alive by changes at PNB is essential to ensure that the bank continues to grow and compete with its peers better,"" he said and elaborated on several steps that are in the pipeline or have already been initiated to reduce human intervention. Apart from AI and analytics, the bank said it has strengthened the process of underwriting of credit to minimize the possibility of fraudulent behaviour by splitting it into four components with different employees focusing on sourcing, appraisal, process and underwriting, documentation and disbursement, and recovery. The internal audit process is also being augmented to give higher weight to the off-site monitoring mechanism and reduce dependence on physical inspection and audit to identify risks. Further, innovative steps have been taken by the bank to accelerate NPA recovery and a stressed asset vertical has been constituted for early identification of NPAs. Recently, Mehta had told TOI that the bank is hoping to recover a quarter of its sticky assets of Rs 80,000 crore in over 12 months or so.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/punjab-national-bank-to-rely-on-artificial-intelligence-to-check-frauds/articleshow/64056289.cms
2018-05-04,3 of 4 senior IT executives say AI execution still a pain point in firms,Ranjani Ayyar,"Chennai: Even as Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) finds new applications every day, organisations continue to struggle with implementation. A survey commissioned by global data storage player Seagate amongst IT professionals from six Asia Pacific markets shows that most respondents struggle to know where and how to start their organisation’s development and implementation of AI (75%). On a positive note, 96% in APAC believe AI applications will drive productivity and business performance and an almost equal number of respondents (95%) believe further investments in their IT infrastructure are required to enable them to support their use of AI. In India, 90% respondents have implemented AI in one or more areas of their business, much higher than 74% reported in APAC. “The opportunities to reap AI are tremendous. Building robust infrastructure is key to gaining competitive advantage as AI applications are driving an explosion in storage requirement,” said BS Teh, senior vice president of global sales and sales operations, Seagate Technology. Teh adds that the explosion of data is only expanding markets for several sectors. ""We see a trend of edge devices emerging which throws open opportunities for Seagate as a storage company to offer services to this new trend,"" he said. Teh adds that with AI, the pressure on innovation and technology is higher than before. “Strategy is a challenge. The task of deploying increasing capacity within cost constraints and maintaining performance is a common thread across companies,” said Teh. Close to 97% Indian respondents said they could do more in AI if they had the right talent. P K Viswanathan, professor — analytics, Great Lakes Institute of Management, Chennai said, “While India produces a substantial engineering graduates every year, the talent focuses mainly on IT and not research, and innovation that are the bedrock of AI. To work on AI, you need people who not only have a strong technology background, but also have analytical thinking, puzzle-solving skills, and they should not be scared of numbers.” Some corporates have taken to partnering with academic institutions to drive researc hand build the ecosystem. For instance, GAVS Technologies has partnered with several academic institutitions such as IIT-M. “AI is a relatively new technology. Hence, the familiarity with languages like Python, R, etc. is low. We also need data scientists to build algorithms and that is a rare skill,” said Sumit Ganguli, CEO, GAVS Technologies.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/3-of-4-senior-it-executives-say-ai-execution-still-a-pain-point-in-firms/articleshow/63992038.cms
2018-04-29,This Indian techie is fighting sexism in artificial intelligence,Ketaki Desai,"What do you do when you’re a 14-year-old who wants a computer but doesn’t have one? Most of us would beg and plead with parents, the more industrious among us may attempt to save up money, but Kriti Sharma did what seemed obvious to her: she devoured tech tomes and built herself one. The 30-year-old is essentially a problem solver. Problem No 1 on her list right now is sexism in tech. Frustrated by the reinforcement of sexist ideas by bots, she created Pegg, a gender-neutral personal finance assistant. Most virtual assistants have female personas — Siri, Alexa, Cortana are at your beck and call for boring, mundane stuff. Compare them to AI platforms such as IBM’s Watson and Salesforce’s Einstein , which get the more complex tasks. “This reminds me of the TV show Mad Men, the idea of this female secretary who is subservient. You’re reinforcing the same behaviour,” says Sharma. As VP of artificial intelligence (AI) and ethics at Sage, a British software company, Sharma says that AI and bots are “going to be as important and prevalent in our lives as smartphones, so we need to make sure it’s done the right way”. Kids today are growing up with AI, she adds. “If they grow up in a world where they can shout orders at a female voice without saying thank you, sorry or please, that’s not right. It’s wiring them to see this stereotypical behaviour as normal.” Sharma, who grew up in Jaipur and shifted to the UK at 22 for a master’s in computer science at the University of St Andrews , cites her mother, a journalist working in Rajasthan , as her inspiration for challenging stereotypes. “I learnt a lot from the way she challenged people, did the right thing and stood up for herself.” Currently, Sharma is working on an AI system to help report domestic abuse. Given the stigma surrounding abuse, she argues that the bots’ lack of “human-ness” could actually help victims open up. AI, which is based on a machine learning model, learns from the data it is provided. If the data is sexist, the outcome will reflect that bias. “There was a recent study done where ads for jobs which pay more than $200,000 were more likely to be shown to men than to women.” Sharma explains why the system functions in that way. “The AI that is choosing who to show the ads to knows that historically, men have made more money than women and, therefore, showing these jobs to men, it’s more likely to be successful. We must change the metric of success from quickly finding a candidate to giving everyone a fair shot.” At Sage, she focuses on how to build AI more ethically. This includes diverse hiring practices, transparency in the decision-making processes of AI and using it to create more equality. This code has been made public and other tech companies are encouraged to incorporate it into their work. So when you think of the potential of AI, don’t just think of a dystopian future filled with killer robots, also think of Kriti Sharma. Think about good people using technology to do good things.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/this-indian-techie-is-fighting-sexism-in-ai/articleshow/63955055.cms

2018-04-23,Twitter co-founder invests in Delhi-based AI startup Visit,PTI,"NEW DELHI: Twitter co-founder Biz Stone has invested in his ""personal capacity"" in a Delhi-based health startup that uses an artificial intelligence-based bot in its app as he wants to contribute to a future where AI is seen as a ""positive enhancement of humanity"". Founded in 2016, 'Visit' is an on-demand healthcare service online platform which provides its users a pool of medical specialists and general physicians to choose from for consultation. Recently, it introduced an artificial intelligence-based 'chatbot' that acts as a digital assistant to provide ""smart help"" to patients in accessing consultation from doctors. Vaibhav Singh, co-founder and head of growth at the firm, claims it is country's first AI-integrated health app, and ""we had pitched to our investors highlighting this aspect only"". Stone, one of the three Silicon Valley-based investors in the startup, said Visit facilitates a ""symbiotic relationship between AI and doctors"", making a hugely positive impact for patients. ""This is why I can get so optimistic about technology amplifying the best in humanity. Investing in Visit is my small way of contributing to a future where AI is seen as a positive enhancement of humanity that really does improve lives,"" Stone told . Visit Internet Services was started by four students of BITS-Pilani, including Vaibhav, now 24, while they were in the final year of their course. The venture has already received funding from MapMyIndia, and based out of Okhla in south Delhi. ""Among Indian investors, Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal, co-founders of e-commerce firm, Snapdeal, have invested in our company. ""Other Bay Area-based (US-based) investors are BlueJeans Network co-founder Alagu Periyannan and Karthee Madasamy, a former top official of Qualcomm Ventures. All of them have invested in personal capacity,"" Vaibhav said. ""The bot learns about conditions and their associated symptoms by parsing millions of live chats on the Visit app and uses its NLP (Natural Language Processing) engine to extract information about symptoms and possible diagnoses by the doctor,"" Shashvat Tripathi, 25, head of technology at Visit Shashvat, said. The bot learns using this data and uses the information to ""reinforce its decision network"". ""It does not throw up stored responses to questions, but learns from the answers given by the user, which makes it unique,"" he said. ""We have enhanced the chatbot since its launch. It now also tracks user's activity, sleep, calories and fitness data to help them reach their goals with continuous reminders, insights and motivation,"" Vaibhav added. Visit offers paid online consultation, through video and voice channels, and seven days of free follow-up check-up over text chat. Besides, it maintains a pool of MBBS doctors, who through its 'Q' service, offer free health advice by text. The online platform, currently has a pool of 2,200 doctors which include psychologists, dietitians, dermatologists, sexologists, gynaecologists, preventive cardiology and paediatrician, besides general physicians. ""For a general physician (having an MD), the consultation fee is Rs 400, for a psychologist (Rs 800), sexologist (Rs 500), gynaecologist (Rs 400), among other verticals,"" he said. Stone while appreciating the AI aspect of the app, said its objective is ""not to replace the doctor"" but to help practitioners in an assistive way. ""The true promise of technology is to amplify the best traits in humanity. It doesn't always seem like that, and I'll admit there are legitimate concerns about the possible negative impact of the fourth industrial revolution.

The president made the remarks during his address at the 17th convocation of the Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha here. ""The tradition of Sanskrit language, literature and science has been the most effective chapter in the glorious journey of our intellectual growth. ""It is said that India's soul is reflected in Sanskrit language, which is the mother of several languages,"" he said, according to a press release. Kovind said the most important thing is that proliferation of the knowledge available in Sanskrit is very relevant for the welfare of the world. ""It is not that the works in Sanskrit are limited to spiritualism, philosophy, devotion, ritualism or literature. It is also the language of knowledge and science. Important works of scientists and mathematicians such as Aryabhatt, Varaah Mihir, Bhaskar, Charak and Sushrut were created in Sanskrit,"" he said. The president said now yoga is being discovered across the world and celebrated internationally on June 21, while Ayurveda is also gaining popularity and all this knowledge was originally available only in Sanskrit.

2018-04-14,"With eye on future, DRDO aims for AI, robotics",TNN,"CHENNAI: After successfully churning out supersonic and subsonic missiles, Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ) is planning to keep up with the technological changes in modern day weaponry and warfare. DRDO chairman S Christopher said the public sector R&D unit was planning to focus on artificial intelligence and robotics in the coming years. Speaking at a press conference at DefExpo 2018 on Friday, Christopher said the organisation was focussing on a few new projects including upgrade of existing products for which 30% of the total funds were being allocated. “Artificial intelligence would be a focus area,” he added. The organisation, however, is not working based on a request from the defence forces. “Rather we are taking a proactive approach to ensure that India should have the capability to have artificial intelligence-based systems including the command and control system for example,” said Subrata Rakshit of Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, one of the lab that belongs to DRDO. He also said AI could be used effectively by the defence forces when a complete digitisation happens. Indian Navy is working to digitise its ships, he said. DRDO displayed a few of its robots at its stall in the expo. The robots can move in different terrains and can interact with one another. An official said these robots are ideal for deployment inside buildings in urban areas and can offer a sense of the terrain to army personnel before they move in.

Christopher said future plans included a long range (1,000km) radar, self-protection suites and electro optics for submarines, variants of armoured vehicles like ambulances and other services, aerostat-based deep penetrating surveillance on a MIG plane, a lighter version of BrahMos missile that could be launched from ships, submarines, planes and others.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/with-eye-on-future-drdo-aims-for-ai-robotics/articleshow/63753707.cms
2018-04-13,"See the best of AI, 5D tech and more from IIT-Delhi",Manash Pratim Gohain,"NEW DELHI: From an “intelligent” prosthetic limb and a non-hazardous, long-lasting “flow battery” to a new type of loom and technology to convert agriculture waste into pulp that saves 40% water and energy than usual, the Indian Institute of Technology , Delhi, will showcase its innovation at its 14th Open House on April 21 . The engineering institution will also throw open its laboratories to the public, students and industry on the occasion. The day-long event will commence at 9.30am. After talks on 5D technology and Artificial Intelligence, the laboratories and an exhibition on innovative products and appliances will be opened for public viewing. The technologies and devices developed in-house include technology to produce pulp from farm waste. This will not only boost the income of the farmers, but also help curb air pollution by avoiding waste burning, a problem that has assumed an important dimension in the fight against poor air quality in Delhi. Another interesting innovation is the newly developed handloom. Different mechanical designs were finalised to aid in the ergonomic ease of using the loom while enhancing productivity. Several prototypes were made and a scale model was installed at Chirala in Andhra Pradesh, where trials are under way. A productivity hike of 9-12 times is estimated via this new design. As for the Intelligent Artificial Leg developed by IIT-D, Vipin Kumar, who uses this prosthetic limb, testified, “For four years, I had a passive artificial leg fitted. Then after I got IIT-D’s intelligent leg, I have been feeling more comfortable and now think perhaps that I will even be able to run.” Professor B K Panigrahi, convenor of the Open House, explained that the event is an occasion for both the inventions of the students to be publicised as well as allow general public and industry a peek into IIT-D’s labs. “The labs are of interest to the school kids from Class X and above, especially those from the science stream. We have, for example, the robotics labs. And then the students can also visit the chemistry lab where we will demonstrate how to make glass,” said Panigrahi. On Media Day, to be organised before the Open House, the institute will showcase around 25 products that have been patented or have their patents filed and are ready for commercial production. More products will be on display at the Open House, some of which are under research. A poster exhibition will also explicate the research work being undertaken by IIT-D’s BTech and MTech students. Apart from the school students, the annual event is a special attraction for science and technology students of higher education institutions and industry. “Last year, around 450 industrial participants and over 2,500 school students attended the Open House,” said Panigrahi.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/see-the-best-of-ai-5d-tech-and-more-from-iit-d/articleshow/63738557.cms
2018-04-11,AI research: CET ties up with IT giant,TNN,"1 2 THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The technology companies often lament about the difficulty in getting industry-ready talents. A similar complaint is levelled by academic institutions, which cite how outdated curriculums hamper the job prospects of students being trained. Now, IT firm UST Global has stepped in to do their bit to bridge the industry-academia gap. UST Global has signed a memorandum of understanding with the College of Engineering Trivandrum (CET) which will allow Infinity Labs, an innovation centre of UST Global, and CET students to jointly collaborate in cutting edge technologies like robotics and artificial intelligence ( AI ).

2018-04-01,This Russian robot may hire you for your next job,Agencies,"Forget losing your job to a bot, it might be hiring and firing you next. A Russian startup has created a realistic looking robot that’s being used to interview prospective employees at several top international companies. Called Vera, the robot uses artificial intelligence technology to narrow down applicants to the top candidates based on job requirements. Vera was developed by St Petersburg-based startup Strafory and now counts more than 300 clients, including Pepsi, Ikea and L’Oreal, according to Bloomberg. Companies are mostly using Vera to recruit employees for ‘high-turnover service and blue collar positions’ like clerks, waiters and construction workers, Bloomberg said. Vera can shave off the cost of recruiting by a third, as she’s able to interview hundreds of applicants at the same time. The firm’s founders said they often wasted valuable time calling candidates who were no longer interested in the job or that they couldn’t get in touch with. ""We felt like robots ourselves, so we figured it was better to automate the task,"" Strafory co-founder Alexander Uraksin told Bloomberg. Strafory equipped Vera with advanced speech recognition capabilities that allow her to complete complex tasks and hold conversations. Programmers trained Vera using 13 billion examples of language and speech from TV, Wikipedia and job listings. As a result, Vera is able to speak in a more conversational way and understand a variety of phrases. The firm is now teaching Vera how to recognise anger, pleasure and disappointment. The move comes as a growing number of employers have turned to AI to make hiring and firing decisions, as well as to determine how people feel about their bosses. One of the most popular kinds of workplace-focused AI software is called Xander and it can determine whether an employee feels optimistic, confused or angry, among other things. Xander analyses responses to open-ended questions, assigning attitudes or opinions to employees based on language and other data. After lapping up the data, Xander can determine whether an employee feels optimistic, confused or angry. The use of AI has increased productivity but experts warn that AI may contain biases that could lead to workplace discrimination.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/this-russian-robot-may-hire-you-for-your-next-job/articleshow/63563841.cms
2018-03-31,Kotak becomes first bank to roll out AI-run voicebot,Mayur Shetty,"Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank has launched the country’s first artificial intelligence-powered voicebot in the banking sector. The voicebot has been developed using a library of millions of phone-banking conversations over the past three years. The lender has integrated the voicebot Keya, which can understand both Hindi and English, with its phone-banking helpline. Keya uses automatic speech recognition , natural language understanding and text-to-speech technology . It is powered by Nuance , the technology behind Apple ’s Siri. However, the bank is not using voice for biometric authentication . “Of all the mediums through which customers can interact with us, voice is the most preferred,” said Puneet Kapoor, senior executive VP, Kotak Mahindra Bank. According to him, the reason behind it was that customers can get their issues resolved in a single interaction. The voicebot uses natural language understanding to navigate the customer directly to the destination where he can get his issue resolved. It saves time by bypassing the various options in an interactive voice response system (IVRS). Keya has been trained to recognise voice of customers across the country and can covert speech to text irrespective of the accent of the customer. The lender plans to keep adding to the library based on customer queries so that more responses can be automated. “Even when you look at how the global ecosystem is evolving, voice is emerging to be the preferred medium. According to one study, 50% of all searches will be voice-based by 2020. If you look at all the bots — Siri or Alexa — they started as text and evolved into voice-based commands,” said Kapoor. For the bank, which is planning to double its customer base, Keya helps in efficient agent utilisation and better deployment at the Kotak contact centre as simpler calls get automated and complex calls get routed for human assistance. If Keya is not able to address the request, the call gets seamlessly transferred to an agent who can pick up the query from where the machine left off.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/kotak-becomes-first-bank-to-roll-out-ai-run-voicebot/articleshow/63551132.cms
2018-03-28,"10 years on, plan to use AI to manage Delhi traffic takes off",Raj Shekhar,"Motorists stuck in a jam near Akshardham (File Photo) NEW DELHI: Almost a decade after it was conceived, Delhi Police ’s ambitious “intelligent traffic management system” (ITMS) — that proposes to use artificial intelligence to manage traffic and an array of sensors to detect violators — is finally expected to become a reality with the home ministry giving approval for appointment of an international consultant for the job. Following the go-ahead, Delhi Police has begun talks with several international firms and the process of appointment is likely to wind up by May, sources said, adding that the project will be implemented in three phases, with the first most likely to be completed by 2019. The new ITMS plan proposes a comprehensive traffic management system that involves setting up of traffic detecting sensors, CCTV cameras, automatic number plate recognition camera (ANPR) systems, speed violation detection at important crossings and stretches, signalised pedestrian crossings and stopline violation detection systems. In US and Canada, sensors at every 100m or so There will be lane monitoring systems to facilitate 24x7 scanning of traffic volumes apart from signal cycle phases at all strategic junctions, leading to a modern adaptive traffic control system. The consultant will prepare a detailed project report (DPR) and help police in planning and execution. The components of the project will also be installed in batches. Asked for a comment, Delhi Police chief spokesperson, special commissioner Dependra Pathak, said, “The traffic police is working on use of technology, particularly artificial intelligence and the mathematical models, to make real time dynamic decisions on traffic flows and for better public service delivery system.” The system would be backed by a robust communication backbone with state of the art IT support, officials said. Traffic data will be stored in elastic computing models or cloud based systems that will enable dynamic usage. All ITMS systems will be on a single communication network using the latest technology, such as 4G and fibre optic networks. The proposal has remained on paper for almost a decade. Though the traffic police have come up with plans to install independent systems, which can be integrated into the final system later, the overall implementation of the project has been stuck in red tape. The traffic officials have cited fund crunch and lack of trained manpower as hurdles in the way of the project. Most of the money allocated to traffic goes in maintenance of traffic signals and other infrastructure. In other countries, smart city road projects include measures to control, monitor and ensure smooth traffic flows. Countries such as the US and Canada have sensors installed every few hundred metres to monitor traffic. An electronic system monitor then sets the most suitable speed limit and accordingly adjusts signages. The operators also have access to hundreds of CCTV cameras placed along the route mainly to control speeds. Congestion is reduced by ramp metering devices where traffic signals are used strategically on slip roads so that it temporarily stores traffic. The pile-up is then released on the main road one vehicle at a time.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/10-years-on-plan-to-use-ai-to-manage-city-traffic-takes-off/articleshow/63495347.cms
2018-03-08,Google supplying AI tech for US military's drones,Agencies,"Google 's artificial intelligence technology is being used by the US Department of Defense to analyse drone footage, a rare and controversial move by a company that's actively limited its work with the military in the past. The collaboration was accidentally revealed in an internal mailing list shared last week, setting off a firestorm among the company's employees, some of whom expressed outraged at use of the company's resources for surveillance technology involved in drone operations, according to a report on tech website Gizmodo. The tie-up is part of a pilot project known as Project Maven, and most likely involves Google staffers helping the military figure out how to use TensorFlow application programming interfaces, or APIs, and other AI technologies. APIs are software-based rules that let computer programmes communicate. TensorFlow is a popular set of APIs and other tools that help build artificial intelligence capabilities like machine learning and computer vision. Google did not disclose financial terms of the contract. The feature is part of a recent Pentagon contract won by Google's cloud unit, which is trying to wrest more government spending from cloud-computing leaders Amazon and Microsoft. Alphabet's Google bids on federal contracts and supplies some equipment to the military, but it has so far been sensitive about how its technology is used. A Google spokeswoman said, ""The technology flags images for human review, and is for non-offensive uses only. Military use of machine learning naturally raises valid concerns. We're actively discussing this important topic internally and with others as we continue to develop policies and safeguards around the development and use of our machine learning technologies."" Google is trying to downplay the revelation as business as usual. The company's official statement stresses that Google has always worked with ""government agencies"". Google also insists that the contract is for ""non-offensive"" uses. But it's not clear what exactly ""non-offensive"" means. Google technology may not be part of a Skynet-like system that allows drones to automatically fire missiles when Google's AI technology detects an enemy target. But Google's AI technology will allow drones to distinguish between a school with students carrying books and a bunker with gun toting fighters. However, it will still be up to military analysts to then decide whether or not to strike a target. The collaboration appears alarming as Google has accumulated vast amounts of personal data about users' lives — from their search history, to the places they go using Google Maps. The tie-up comes as a bit of a surprise, considering in 2014, after Google bought AI specialist DeepMind, the firm set up an ethics committee to ensure the technology wasn't abused.

2018-02-27,IUCAA Pune using Artificial Intelligence to study galaxies,Snehlata Shrivastav,"NAGPUR: Scientists in Pune based Inter-University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) are using artificial intelligence (AI) to image and understand the millions of galaxies in the universe. The study is particularly identifying ‘bar’ like patterns in the galaxies. It is also trying to study collisions of galaxies. Former IUCAA director and renowned astrophysicist, Prof Ajit Kembhavi told TOI that a technique, ‘Deep learning’, is emerging as a good tool of AI which is helping scientist understand the universe. He was in city for four-day international conference “The Physical Universe’ hosted by the Central India Research Institute (CIRI) and Nagpur University. Kembhavi said deep learning was advanced stage of ‘machine learning’ and worked on AI that allows phones or computers to do face reading or finger print recognition. “How does an unmanned vehicle work? It works by reading the objects in the path using AI. Similarly, digital reading of an image helps in recognizing the smaller patterns in it. It works exactly like human brain which puts various images together, especially subtle characteristics, to make a complete image,” he said. Similarly, deep learning is used to by astronomers in distinguishing patterns in galaxies, explained Kembhavi. There are lakhs of galaxies and it is impossible to study them individually from their images. Hence AI is being used to identify characteristics of the galaxies. Results obtained so far are put in the Big Data project funded by the National Knowledge Network. Earlier, in the inaugural session of the conference the Nagpur University vice-chancellor S P Kane said that cosmology or study of universe was one of the most difficult sciences. Pune University VC Nitin Karmalkar, MLC from graduate constituency Anil Sole, CIRI director Sanjay Wagh and renowned astrophysicist Jayant Narlikar were also present. Gayoung Chon and Hans Bohringer from the Max Planck Institute of Extra terrestrial Physics garching Germany, Kembhavi and JinLin Han from National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, delivered different talks on the first day.

2018-02-26,Use AI to boost delivery of services: PM Modi,TNN,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday emphasised on participation of more and more women in building 'New India' and urged the scientific community to deliberate on how ' Artificial Intelligence ' (AI) could help the country in helping differently abled persons, tackling natural disasters, extending health services and assisting farmers . ""After all, our dream of 'New India' is the one where women are strong and empowered and are equal partners in the development of the country,"" Modi said in his monthly ' Mann Ki Baat ' radio broadcast. He said it was ""our fundamental duty"" to ensure participation of women in every field of life, be it social or economic. Referring to International Women's Day observed every year on March 8, he recalled the words of Swami Vivekananda, who had said the idea of ""perfect womanhood"" was ""perfect independence"". ""We are part of a tradition where men were identified due to women. Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan, Gandhari-Putra, these were identities of a son,"" the PM said. As India observes National Science Day on February 28, he also stressed on the importance of the ""relentless quest"" for truth. Urging the scientific community to harness 'Artificial Intelligence', he said, ""It was interesting to know about the ongoing miraculous accomplishments in the field of science. Artificial Intelligence aids in making robots and other machines meant for specific tasks. This technology can be harnessed to better the lives of the underprivileged, the marginalised and the needy."" The PM also spoke on safety ahead of National Safety Day on March 4. ""If we are not aware of safety in our daily life, if we are not able to attain a certain level, it will get extremely difficult during the time of disasters,"" he said. Modi regretted that while people read signboards on safety, they often ignored the messages. ""Leave aside natural disasters, most mishaps are a consequence of some mistake or the other on our part. If we stay alert, abide by the prescribed rules and regulations, we shall not only be able to save our own lives but we can also prevent catastrophes harming society,"" he said. While mentioning different steps being taken by civil society and people to achieve Swachhta, the PM talked about the Gobar Dhan scheme, which aims to generate bio-CNG and manure from cattle dung and other wastes.

2018-02-02,"Digital India to push AI, ML, blockchain, doubles allocation to Rs 3,073 crore",TNN,"The government’s efforts behind Digital India got a further boost as the Finance Minister doubled the funds allocated to the programme to Rs 3,073 crore. Sectors like education would likely gain as the FM stressed on bringing about efficiency with the use of deep technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, robotics and blockchain. “NITI Aayog will initiate a national programme to direct our efforts in the area of artificial intelligence, including research and development of its applications. Technology will be the biggest driver in improving the quality of education. We propose to increase the digital intensity in education and move gradually from blackboard to digital board. Technology will also be used to upgrade the skills of teachers through the recently launched digital portal Diksha,” the FM said. Startups in the AI, ML, big data, Internet of Things (IoT), 3D printing space are likely to get a leg up as a result. “I believe AI and ML can help India leapfrog across various sectors. Areas like healthcare, defence, cyber security, finance are ripe for disruption and India being such a large economy can really take advantage of AI and ML in a positive way,” said Manish Singhal, co-founder, pi Ventures, a VC fund which invests in deep technology startups. While Arun Jaitley stayed away from announcing any changes to the contentious angel tax which is presently being levied at 30%, he did mention floating a hybrid investment instrument for VC funds and startups along with launching additional measures to strengthen the environment for the growth of alternative investment funds (AIF) in India. K Ganesh, serial entrepreneur and partner, GrowthStory, said he was hopeful the government would follow this up with an action plan soon. Taxing angel investors is a retrograde step and one of the biggest irritants in the startup ecosystem today, he said. Avnish Bajaj, MD at Matrix Venture Partners, a VC fund, said, “The measures that would really help the growth of the AIFs are taxation of private company capital gains at par with listed company capital gains, ease of setting up pooling structures for foreign capital, ease of investing, redemption and buyback of investor and modification of the bankruptcy code to allow orderly and fast winding down of startups.” The FM said fintech startups will play a crucial role in the lending and financing space to help MSMEs. A group in the Ministry of Finance is examining the policy and institutional development measures needed for creating right environment for fintech companies to grow in India. ""From a fintech perspective, it will be a big boost for companies operating in the financing of small and medium enterprise sector. It is impressive to see the government focus on the ease of online facility for credit process. The use of technology will become prevalent, refinancing of these NBFCs will provide easier access to capital, and fintech companies can use alternate data to finance SMEs,"" said Jitendra Gupta , Managing Director at PayU India, an online payments firm. IT industry body Nasscom’s president R Chandrashekhar said, ""The government has zeroed in on gaming-changing technologies like AI, robotics, blockchain and 5G. Carrying out this agenda requires leveraging synergies and capabilities with government-backed research institutes, academia and private research bodies.

2018-01-23,Meet on AI-related learning at schools,TNN,"Representative Image CHENNAI: Ever thought that an investigation of a crime scene or building an interactive-friendly monster could be part of classroom learning at the school level? In an era where institutions are attempting to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics in their curriculum, learning systems too are set to undergo changes. To deliberate on different kinds of learning that institutions will have to adopt for changes in the years ahead, the Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Foundation (RAAIF) in association with Anna University, Vibha and the US consulate organised a ‘21st century education conclave’ on Monday. The foundation is attempting to bring in different modules (like the two mentioned above) at the school level involving robotics and other AI-related hands-on learning. The foundation has close to 1,000 schools in Chennai and is seeking to train teachers. “This should start at the school level so that students at college level are equipped for the future,” said RAAIF founder-chairman Kris Kumar. Several panellists who attended the conclave at Anna University also discussed the kind of approach required in teaching in educational institutions. One of these was to focus on the hands-on learning of STEM subjects Science, Technology, Engineering and Management – as it would serve as handy tools in the era of AI and robotics. However, they also said it was important to have a balance between academic and creative abilities. While logic and academics are given a lot of prominence, artistic abilities have to be actively emphasised which is missing at the college level, said Sivakumar , dean of students at IIT Madras . “The foundation for developing both abilities must be set right from the school level. It is like making one wing very strong but neglecting the other. How will a bird fly is only one side is strong,” he questioned. Lawrence Mohanraj , GM, IBM India said while the ability to communicate is another aspect constantly being scrutinised, institutions must first help its students develop clarity of thought which is key for effective communication and that language skills would follow next.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/meet-on-ai-related-learning-at-schools/articleshow/62611204.cms

""The two PMs agreed to launch a working group, which will work on cooperation between nuclear companies. Japan's intention is to start this quickly, possibly by the end of this month,"" he said. With an aggressive and expansionist China growing as a challenge to both India and Japan, the two countries are increasingly looking at the world from a similar lens. While the latest buzzword in international geopolitics, 'Indo-Pacific', might sound American, its actually Japanese in origin, having been articulated by Abe himself as far back as 2007. In 2018, Japan's is aiming for a ""free and open Indo-Pacific"", a theme Sonoura expounded on at the recent Raisina Dialogue. This, he told TOI, was a coming together of Japan's Indo-Pacific policy and India's Act East policy. ""We need to share the importance of rule of law and freedom of navigation among related countries. The next step is infrastructure development based on global standards, so that connectivity among countries is increased. The third step would be maritime law enforcement and disaster management that would ensure the stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region. Therefore, we would like to connect and combine our Indo-Pacific strategy and India's Act East policy as a one big picture. That's the synergy we seek,"" Sonoura said. This is the kind of grand strategy that incorporates a stronger bilateral relationship as well as a multilateral one, between Japan-India-US, Japan-US-Australia and the Quadrilateral , Japan-US-India-Australia, seeking to tilt the strategic balance away from China. Working with India in the quadrilateral, Sonoura said, the aims were slowly crystallising. ""Among these four countries, we have the same standards in terms of maritime strategy and basic values. So it's important to realise these values - non-proliferation, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. Its important to utilise the strengths of these countries and use it. Rather than frameworks, its important what we can do - to create concrete results which should be visible to the world,"" he said. For India, the key aims of the quadrilateral is to come together on non-proliferation and on freedom of navigation. To counter China's growing influence in India's neighbourhood, India has encouraged the presence of Japan and the US in South Asian countries, actions that might have elicited mild protests earlier. Consequently, New Delhi was remarkably quiet when Japanese foreign minister Taro Kono recently visited Pakistan, Maldives and Sri Lanka, increasing Japanese presence in these countries. Japan has already ramped up its involvement in Bangladesh and Myanmar, both countries on China's radar. Questioned on this, Sonoura said, ""Foreign minister Kono visited Maldives for the first time and Sri Lanka for the first time in 15 years. Last year I visited Mauritius, Madagascar, Kenya and Mozambique. If you place this within the rubric of Japan's Indo-Pacific strategy, you will get the larger picture."" In Islamabad, Sonoura said, the Japanese message was clear that Pakistan had to take action on terrorism and terrorists. ""With Pakistan, we have an older relationship. But in terms of counter-terrorism, our foreign minister told the Pakistanis they need to do more,"" he said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-japan-to-introduce-ai-robotics-in-defence-sector/articleshow/62597018.cms
2018-01-11,"Artificial Intelligence won’t overpower humans, says whiz kid Tanmay Bakshi",TNN,"BHOPAL: The youngest software developer and coder in the world Tanmay Bakshi , 14, a Canadian of Indian origin, on Wednesday allayed fears of Artificial Intelligence (AI) overpowering humans. Tanmay was in the city to deliver a keynote address on ‘Aritificial Intelligence (AI) and Coding’ at the Rajiv Gandhi Proudyogiki Vishwavidhyalaya (RGPV) organised jointly by e-Entrepreneurship Cell of RGPV and TEQUIP-III at the conference hall. He was accompanied by his parents and technical experts. “AI can lead to a breakthrough in medicine. We can develop such systems that can diagnose cancer, depression; help differently-abled people and those suffering from moto-neuron diseases to lead better lives,” he said adding, “AI is created by humans to amplify human skills, not to replace them. We will not be creating humanoids or machines to be proficient in everything, but for a specific purpose. Like if we talk about medical science, we wish to design devices to diagnose diseases but that would be the only purpose of that machine.” The event turned interactive when the teenage software developer replied to queries, mostly revolving around AI, of the young participants. Further speaking on AI and coding, he reiterated: “We need not worry about Artificial Intelligence. The prospect that machines and robots will overpower humans will arise when they’ll be equipped with ‘Artificial General Intelligence’ (AGI). That is a far-fetched scenario which might not even happen.” Later, a debate was held on ‘Artificial Intelligence: Boon or Bane’ in which the Tanmay’s teenage partner Parth Katara spoke in favour of the subject. Parth is from Gujarat and has scored 160 in the Mensa IQ test. Ending the seminar with an advice to budding app developers, Bakshi’s said: “Start small, start easy. Start with simple programmes first. Take your time. If you are not passionate about coding, especially AI, do not continue. AI, right now is more like art than science. Only pursue it if you are passionate about it.” “It is great to have a child prodigy among us. He is making India proud by becoming the youngest entrepreneur, coder and developer. I hope you benefit from the interaction. More such workshops need to be conducted in order to popularize coding and programming among youngsters,” said commerce and industry minister Rajendra Shukla. Hailing Tanmay, Prof Sunil K Gupta, vice-chancellor, RGPV said, “The E-enterprenureship cell has put in a lot of efforts to make this event possible. It’s a rare opportunity for the students to listen and interact with Tanmay. He is God-gifted as well as very intelligent kid who has acquired huge fame across the globe at such a young age. Even adults are asking for the teen’s advice and I hope the students also benefit from this workshop.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/ai-wont-overpower-humans-says-whiz-kid-tanmay-bakshi/articleshow/62451281.cms
2018-01-04,Artificial Intelligence: The magic wand in the hands of a salesman,Ranjani Ayyar,"Chennai: Why pay a common motor insurance premium if you’re statistically safer than the rest of the demographic? Insurance companies are aggregating customer data to gauge premiums dynamically. If you are a middle aged man with two kids and drive an SUV, your premiums will be lesser than a 25 year old youth who just got his first sedan. AI and data analytics is changing the sales game rapidly, equipping sales personnel with the right tools and data so they improve conversions and save time. The next time you go to a shop and your favourite dress is out of stock, the salesperson at the counter would take in your order and source it from the neighbouring retail store and earn brownie points. Analytics goes a long way in helping shop floor salespersons handle stocks and manage customer demand during sale seasons. “For large retail chains, analytics helps connect inventories of shops and reduce ‘out of stock’ conditions,” said Souma Das, MD, Qlik. The US-headquartered company offers visual analytics, which makes one understand customer requirement faster. Qlik has partnered with insurance companies who arm their agents with data that help them gauge demographics and sell the right policy. “More often than not, agents sell the wrong policy without knowing the economic condition of the cross section of population and the conversion rate falls. From our analytics, a data driven approach improves the productivity by 15% in the first year itself. Possibility of overselling a policy to a retired customer reduces,” said Das. Using the platform, agents on the move also get the best route to cover the maximum target customers and increase productivity. Bengaluru-based Vymo positions itself as a personal sales assistant. 4 of the top 5 banks in India have engaged with Vymo for their sales personnel. “While a bank can have upto 52 different products in its portfolio, each customer buys an avergae of 1 to 2 products. The scope for cross selling is big. Banks are aggregating customer data so that the most relevant products are pitched to the customer. For example — if you just got a raise at work, then the bank can automatically increase your credit card limit,” said Yamini Bhat, cofounder and CEO, Vymo. Bhat says while top CRM apps see an engagement rate of 30%, with Vymo, they have seen up to 80% engagement. Chennai-based PipeCandy uses data science techniques to discover the right prospects for B2B sales reps and helps them segment the prospects based on industry specific nuances. “For example, a company that sells point of sale (POS) software can discover retailers that have omni-channel presence and filter them based on number of SKUs (stock keeping units) they sell,” says Ashwin Ramaswamy, co-founder and CMO, PipeCandy. For US-based Shyp, a last mile e-commerce fulfilment company, the sales team wanted to know which e-commerce companies use Shopify platform, have traffic over 500K visitors a month and use a costly shipping option (USPS, Fedex, DHL). They also had a constraint that they could serve only those ecommerce companies that are in specific zipcodes. “This is very specific targeting and there is no database provider that classifies companies into ‘e-commerce’ bucket. They are bundled under ‘Retail’. We use data science to zero in on your prospects,” added Ramaswamy. SaaS company Zoho’s AI driven assistant Zia has the potential to tell you what is the tone of the customer - positive or negative, “ When a customer spend maximum time on the website, when are the maximum chances of your email being read is captured.Zia observes sales patterns and makes suggestions,” said Raju Vegesna, chief evangelist, Zoho.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/artificial-intelligence-the-magic-wand-in-the-hands-of-a-salesman/articleshow/62357942.cms
2017-12-26,First robot to get citizenship coming to city this weekend,TNN,"MUMBAI: Have a question for Sophia, the world’s first humanoid robot who has been granted citizenship by a country? You can tweet it to Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay’s TechFest team. Sophia will be visiting India, her maiden trip to the country, on December 30 to attend the TechFest—the institute’s annual science and technology meet. Select questions asked by Twitterati will be put in front of Sophia by a moderator when she will be on the institute’s campus. “We are starting a Twitter campaign wherein users can send questions to Sophia using the hashtag #AskSophia,” said Anirudh Poddar, manager, media and marketing, Techfest. In 2014, the Techfest had hosted BINA 48, the most advanced social robot to talk to in the world at that time. Sophia, known for her jibe at Elon Musk, CEO of electric car maker Tesla and a staunch opponent of artificial intelligence, will also interact with a select audience of engineers on the campus. The robot, who was granted citizenship by Saudi Arabia in October, will spend the entire day on the campus and will also be part of an hour-long interaction in the institute’s convocation hall. “During summer, we were listing down the most advanced artificial intelligence robots and that’s when we considered inviting Sophia. She has been granted a citizenship and hence, we thought she was an interesting choice. When the company agreed, we were ecstatic,” said Poddar. Sophia was created using breakthrough robotics and artificial intelligence technologies developed by Dr David Hanson and his team at Hanson Robotics in Hong Kong. Scheduled to be held from December 29 to 31, the TechFest will also host 14-year-old Tanmay Bakshi, the youngest IBM developer, J Satyanarayana, chairperson of UIDAI and Randy Schekman , Nobel Prize winner for physiology or medicine, among others.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/first-robot-to-get-citizenship-coming-to-city-this-weekend/articleshow/62245401.cms
2017-12-23,This 13-year-old believes AI will serve as tech-tonic for health,Paras Singh,"NEW DELHI: He’s a true prodigy — extremely mature for his age and if you talk to him you won’t realise that he’s just entered his teens. This 13-year-old ‘ Wonder Kid ’ has no time for playing cricket or worrying about completing his homework as he’s busy trying to solve the healthcare problems being faced by a disabled girl who’s unable to communicate. Tanmay Bakshi, an Indian origin kid from Toronto , calls himself a “technology explorer” and is busy programming so that artificial intelligence ( AI ) can be used in neural networks. This nerdy boy was breathless and excited while taking about complicated topics like future of artificial intelligence, self-driven cars, cancer treatment and algorithmic Darwin ecosystem. “It sounds a mouthful but essentially AI is a huge pattern recognition algorithm that we attempt to compute and think in a natural way,” Bakshi said during his interaction with other children his age at FICCI auditorium in New Delhi on Friday. Perhaps the world’s youngest developer, Bakshi has had a rather unusual life. “I started playing with technology when I was five. Even putting up my name on the computer screen seemed magical,” he said. By the time he was seven, Bakshi had learnt multiple coding languages and by Grade III he had developed an app for iOS. By the time he became 10 years old, Bakshi had multiple apps and development tutorials. A chance encounter with a documentary on IBM’s artificial intelligence platform Watson pulled him towards AI. “Currently, I am working on neural algorithms that can identify brainwaves and understand what Bu (the disabled girl) is trying to say. What we are trying to do is read massive amounts of EEG data and analyse it using a mobile device. AI has such huge potential in saving millions of lives in healthcare,” Bakshi said. People wondered whether there was something “normal” with this kid. “I love biking, playing table tennis, eating butter chicken and would love to meet Amitabh Bachchan to play KBC,” Bakshi said. He blushed even more while talking about mundane things like not having a girlfriend. Bakshi sounded extremely confident about the future of AI. “People speculate that millions of jobs will be lost due to artificial intelligence and robotics. But it will open up so many more others by lowering barriers of entry. Humans will be able to focus on what actually matters,” he added. He also spoke about how self-driven cars and AI applications would be able to tackle pollution. But what is it like being the mother of a whiz kid? Sumita Bakshi explained that normally parents like to limit the use of computers and technology for children, but they knew that their son was special right from the start. “I knew he was different and would not use (abuse) computers like other kids. But I do have to take care of his food and basic needs, which he often forgets,” she said. The tech explorer has his platter full as he will be delivering keynote addresses at IITs and several schools across India.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/this-13-yr-old-believes-ai-will-serve-as-tech-tonic-for-health/articleshow/62214766.cms

2017-12-15,20% of Indian enterprises use artificial intelligence,TNN,"BENGALURU: Indian enterprises have been quick to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) with nearly one in five organizations implementing it in some way, said an Intel India commissioned report undertaken by research firm IDC. By mid-2019, about seven in 10 firms are anticipated to deploy AI . IDC surveyed 194 Indian companies across four verticals — telecom, media & technology (TMT); retail; banking, financial services, & insurance ( BFSI ) and healthcare. The report said nearly 75 per cent of the firms surveyed anticipate benefits in business process efficiency and employee productivity with the use of AI, and 64 per cent of the respondents believe that this technology can empower them in revenue augmentation through better targeting of offers and improved sales processes. Despite a higher propensity to adopt AI, firms believe they will face a shortage of skills to unlock the opportunities through AI. “We all talk about the opportunity that India presents for AI, but often the types of industries that will embrace AI, the challenges that AI can address, and the roadblocks in implementation, are vague. This research is a small step towards comprehending this knowledge, and enabling companies such as ours, shape strategy and move ahead in the right direction,” said Prakash Mallya , managing director for sales and marketing at Intel India. The TMT industry emerges as the top early adopter of AI, with a current adoption rate of 37.5 per cent, followed by BFSI, and healthcare. At least 71 per cent of organisations are looking at increased process automation as a key benefit and an almost equal number of firms (69 per cent) are looking at increased employee productivity across several business functions, the report said. However, concerns around adoption of AI continue with high cost of solutions, acute shortage of skilled professionals, unclear return on investment, and cybersecurity emerging as the key hindrances. To bridge the talent gap, the Intel AI Academy Program that covers training on Intel’s distribution of Python (leading AI programming language), tools, libraries, frameworks and platforms for AI, is targeted at educating 15,000 scientists, developers, analysts, and engineers on key AI technologies.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/20-of-indian-enterprises-use-ai/articleshow/62077231.cms

With the demand-supply gap of skilled workforce in the cyber security sector still being a key concern, leading to a continuing dearth of security professionals in the market, experts point to automation as the way forward. “Data privacy is becoming paramount in India, and regulators are also in the process of coming out with data security and privacy regulations,” said Kartik Shahani , integrated security leader, IBM India/South Asia. “AI-based security applications can read and understand security - they analyse every incident, identify root causes, methods, trends and capable of predicting the next pattern of cyber attacks even before they occur. Infusing deep insights derived from crunching huge amounts of data into systems, using AI, can help strengthen a company’s cyber security defence and response systems,” he said. According to reports, the size and cost of data breaches were on the rise in India and elsewhere with more industries being hit by ransomware and other cyber attacks. “The state and central governments must now work towards building a network of cyber security experts and integrate their expertise with AI-driven security solutions to better predict cyber attacks,” said the security director of a vendor company specialising in anti-ransomware solutions .",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cloud-ai-driven-security-services-to-trend-in-2018/articleshow/62077467.cms

Sinha, was interacting with students of IIM Indore during a session on ‘Low Cost Funding From Japan—The Opportunities and Challenges’ organized in collaboration with The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE) Madhya Pradesh chapter. “Japan’s vision is to realise the huge untapped bilateral potential by combining abundant long term and low cost capital and environment friendly and safe technology with the growth potential and global prowess of India,” he said. Decision making process is much rigid in Japan and the country thinks of long term perspective, while India can utilize that in an efficient manner, since the decision making process here is dynamic’, Sinha said. India has growth and human resource available globally; and Japan has technology and capital which India is looking for. Also, Japanese policy makers are keen to provide funding in India as the scenario is changing; and Japanese companies are aggressively pushing more of their companies in India via funding. “We need to build a holistic framework. The Japanese would be happy to come and train our human resources but they need a platform for that purpose—in the form of institutions, firms, startups, etc.; and with institutions like IIT and IIM, that too in the same city like Indore, we can get skilled, educated and talented youth as well. “We have high interest rates and sufficient capital, so we need to collaborate with Japan where they have low rates and long term perspectives’, he said. A long term vision and a good quality of plan along with good presentation to attract the funding will be beneficial for India while working with Japan, he concluded.

2017-12-13,"Companies use AI to fine tune hiring, weed out skillset spam",Aparna Desikan,"Chennai: Often, one hears friends say, ‘just put what all you have worked in so far in your resume, might come in handy’. With algorithms now making the first round of selection from a pile of resumes, keywords of the potential employees’ skillsets determine whether the resume makes it to the shortlist. Knowing the routine, companies see inadequacies in the resumes filtered through the keyword check. Some candidates’ key in skills they are not as proficient in just to facilitate the selection. To overcome the shortcoming, companies employ AI that fetches more suited resumes by narrowing down to a smaller set of skills required for the role. They have a role-based mapping of candidates rather than sifting through resumes with the keywords. Job search platforms such as Naukri use a keyword based approach to roll out job vacancies. Recruitment startup Cutshort.io uses an internal screening process that looks tracks the candidate on professional social network platforms such as Github or Dribble and fetches recommendations that are confidential from ex bosses or professors. The company has 500 companies as paying customers. “The keyword based approach will not work. In a resume, one might input Java or Photoshop just to make the cut even if they are not updated. Knowing fully well that the algorithms detect keywords and professional networks like LinkedIn give room for unlimited skillsets or even open recommendations, there are more irrelevant applications. With options to input just 8 crucial skillsets and using machine learning, we have been able to significantly the number of redundant profiles. Candidates take care to input the skills they are proficient in,” said Nikunj Verma, CEO, Cutshort. Companies use these for a variety of tech and non-tech roles, while they admit that the screening becomes easier for tech roles. Veekshith Rai, co-founder, Finly.io — a fintech startup has hired for tech roles using a platform — Cutshort. “The system has complete details of the candidate right from his professional footprint. Another advantage over going through a resume is the test that the platform offers that ascertains a candidate’s capability better. If one adds Java in the list of skillsets, a certification from Cutshort makes our effort easier,” he said. HR startup Belong has a framework of the kind of roles the companies have already hired and looks to match the potential candidates with them. “We screen over a range of social networks and data bases, match the company’s history and requirement to candidate’s profiles on the platform.

Dr Suneet Tuli, dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences , said the varsity is already in touch with an Indian handset company to explore ways of indigenising mobile phones. “This super computer is different from older iterations, because it is more graphics-based. It thus processes graphical information very fast,” he said. With focus on deep learning — a type of machine-learning method — the collaboration will also help design a specialised curriculum for the subject. Joint workshops in AI, deep learning techniques and problem-solving for students will be held, and tech talks will be conducted at the varsity campus. Explaining how the super computer would help students realise their ideas, Vishal Dhupar, managing director, NVIDIA, South Asia, said “The magic of deep learning is that here, the system continues to learn. It is not like traditional software. It keeps on adding features that anybody might be learning and wanting to add. Along with this, we are bringing to the students academic courses tailored specifically to Indian requirements, but with a complete framework, from teaching to evaluation. We’ll also bring to the table a chance for engineering students to take models and make them applicable to businesses.” For the learning part, the pre-requisite is a basic learning in fields of linear algebra, calculus, probability, statistics, programming and a computer language, said Tuli, adding that programmes will be rolled out for other disciplines at a later stage.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/bennett-university-gets-artificial-intelligence-boost-with-super-computer/articleshow/61871667.cms

2017-10-28,10-year plan: AI to help cops stay ahead of criminal minds,Raj Shekhar,"NEW DELHI: Delhi Police is looking at making a complete switch to technology-aided policing by 2027. A 10-year action plan prepared by the department was reviewed by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Friday. Police commissioner Amulya Patnaik also briefed the LG on the roadmap for the next three years during which the department will be working on use of data analytics-based predictive policing, connected multi-jurisdictional records, centralised database for remote suspect verification and single platform for seamless delivery of services. Senior officers said soon there will be a centralised monitoring system from where they will be able to launch advanced surveillance and investigation tools, like facial recognition programme linked to CCTVs across the city. This will help in identification of suspects. The presentation prepared by joint commissioner M M Oberoi included implementation of smart policing, integration of technology and artificial intelligence in day-to-day policing. Police also aim to introduce a cyber-fusion centre and a security operations centre as part of the plan. Baijal was also told about the long-pending surveillance projects — open source intelligence solution (OSINT) and enterprise information integration solution (EIIS). TOI had first reported about Delhi Police’s plans of induction of OSINT on June 22, 2013. OSINT will help cops extract and analyse material available on numerous public domains on the internet. This technology will focus on gathering “actionable intelligence” and will also perform “sentiment analysis”, the psychological analysis of communications to pre-empt a crime by collecting and analysing data from online sources. EIIIS will help integrate databases like Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems (CCTNS), Crime Criminal Information System (CCIS), Online Criminal Dossier, Zonal Integrated Police Network (ZIPNET) and e-beat books. Police are focusing on developing an e-beat book to improve the beat policing system in the capital and expand the ambit of crime mapping. Plans of integrating the 14 mobile forensic vans in the districts, simulation-based training in cyber investigation, firing and driving, upgraded digital wireless system, emergency response system (112), Safe City and intelligence traffic management system and command and control vehicles were also discussed at the meeting. The plan will also include 3D printing, block chain and crypto currencies, connectivity and convergence in the ambit of investigation. There will be focus on self-learning systems, aggregators and brick and clicks. It is learnt that the LG is keen on expediting the implementation of technology in policing. “Delhi Police will be partnering with academic institutions and enhancing its human resource capability to enable use of technology effectively and efficiently. The action plan for various proposals needs to be prioritised and taken up in a phased manner,” Baijal said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/10-year-plan-ai-to-help-cops-stay-ahead-of-criminal-minds/articleshow/61280632.cms

2017-10-05,"Now, AI that can help you shop, order food and hire a cab",John Sarkar,"NEW DELHI: The battle between virtual assistants is set to escalate with Amazon launching its Alexa voice assistant in India. India is the fourth market after US, UK and Germany where Amazon has launched the Alexapowered Echo , its smart speaker. Japan is next in line. The e-commerce giant is hoping Echo will help it get a firm foothold into Indian households much before other tech giants, including Apple and Google — both have developed similar smart speakers with proprietary voice assistants built in but are yet to launch them in India. By talking to Echo, Amazon’s senior VP for devices and services, David Limp said, “You can do many things from hailing a cab and listening to Salman Khan’s new chartbuster to ordering food and shopping from Amazon.” In India, Alexa will deliver a customized Indian experience, which includes a female voice with a heavily Indianised accent. “In terms of technology, we have tried to make sure we have optimized the service to work in a more-limited broadband environment,” said Limp. “As we hear from customers, they will be able to tell us what to add and we can do it very quickly.” When asked about the other digital assistants already present in the Indian market such as Apple’s Siri and Microsoft ’s Cortana, Limp said, “We are trying to do something different than those two. Both Cortana and Siri grew out of mobile ecosystems. We are centered on an experience that’s less one-on-one because a phone is very personal device. We think of Echo and Alexa as a more communal device. It has to respond to everybody in the house from across the room.”",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/now-ai-that-can-help-you-shop-order-food-and-hire-a-cab/articleshow/60947159.cms
2017-10-03,An AI-based system to assess students with a personal touch,Vinayashree J,"CHENNAI: Can there be multiple correct answers to a single question in an exam? The ‘correct’ answer may not necessarily be in the notes dictated to a student but in the way the question is perceived. Based on this line of thinking, HLC International School has come up with a personalised online learning assessment solution called ‘ Kognify ’. The platform, that uses artificial intelligence to understand the parameters of a question, looks at how performance of individual students can be assessed by the way each child understands and approaches a problem. The school has tied up with professors from Chennai Mathematical Institute to help write algorithms to identify the most important parameters that help students answer correctly or incorrectly. Kognify will help teachers redesign tasks in a classroom by ascertaining the learner’s knowledge and skill levels. Following this, individualised worksheets are designed for every learner to work out deliberately and continuously. The approach, which involves artificial intelligence, cognitive and educational psychology, and data science, is aimed at identifying learning gaps and their correlations so that suitable recommendations can be made to the learner. Naveen Mahesh , director of HLC International School, said while most children are told that they lacked competency in a topic, there was not enough assessment to understand whether the child was struggling with a particular part of the topic or was labelled as poor because he did not answer in a manner similar to the rest of the class. Competencies are interdisciplinary and not restricted to a subject, Mahesh said. ""We have been able to improve performance by personalising the work students do, especially through deliberate practice,"" Mahesh said. ""Teachers in classrooms may give a generic homework, but they cannot give different types of questions to all students because of time constraints. But in this case [Kognify], questions and answers are chosen by the platform,"" he said. Fifty schools are signing up for a three-month-long pilot project starting from October. Currently, the focus is on Cambridge schools. Institutions can add their own questions and personalised homework. Omega International, Vael’s Billabong International School and Crescent International are some of the schools from Tamil Nadu which will try out the assessment system. Every day for three months, these schools will try to identify the biggest parameters in learning. R Visalakshi, president of Private Schools Association, said such a platform can help children go through the actual process of learning and application rather than focussing on accumulation of knowledge. ""Children have become used to memorising. This may be the next step required in learning. But this will take time,"" she said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/an-ai-based-system-to-assess-students-with-a-personal-touch/articleshow/60916959.cms
2017-09-30,IDFC MF plans India’s first AI-driven fund,TNN,"Mumbai: IDFC Mutual Fund will launch for its rich clients an equity fund that will extensively use artificial intelligence (AI) to select stocks for its portfolio, manage the same and also indicate exit opportunities. Although in advanced markets the use of AI in the financial space is growing at a fast clip, IDFC MF’s initiative is the first of its kind in the Indian fund management space. According to IDFC MF CEO Vishal Kapoor, the fund — IDFC Neo Equity Portfolio — was launched about four months ago on a pilot basis, and the results have been encouraging. However, he added that there is a fund manager who has the discretion to override the AI-driven signals and take the final call. “It’s not a pure quant- (quantitative method) driven portfolio management offering,” Kapoor said. A research and advisory firm that works in the AI space, along with an R&D team from a reputed European university also in the same space, are advising IDFC MF on this fund. If this fund — aimed at rich investors with a minimum investment ticket size of Rs 1 crore — succeeds, IDFC MF may plan a similar scheme for retail investors as well and take that to the industry regulator Sebi for approval, Kapoor said.TNN",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/idfc-mf-plans-indias-first-ai-driven-fund/articleshow/60888443.cms
2017-09-30,James Cameron pessimistic about artificial intelligence,PTI,"James Cameron , who is all set to reboot the 'Terminator' franchise, believes artificial intelligence will probably be bad for the human race. In an interview Cameron reflected upon 'Terminator' and the advances in artificial intelligence. 'Terminator' revolves around a cyborg assassin who is sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 to kill the woman whose son will one day become a Saviour against machines in a post- apocalyptic future. Cameron has collaborated with ' Deadpool ' director Tim Miller to carry forward the franchise. The director said he is often asked the question about man versus machines, a theme that is recurrent in his films. ""Technology has always scared me, and it's always seduced me. People ask me, 'Will the machines ever win against humanity?' I say, 'Look at people on their phones. The machines have already won'. It's just (that) they've won in a different way,"" the director, best known for blockbusters such as 'Titanic' and ' Avatar ', said. The filmmaker said while technology and humans were co- evolving, there might come a time when artificial intelligence will become too advanced for the human race. ""One of the scientists we met with recently, she said: 'I used to be really, really optimistic, but now I'm just scared.' Her position on it is probably that we can't control this. It has more to do with human nature."" ""... At the very least, they will reflect our best and worst nature because we make them and we programme them. But it's going to take a lot of money. So who's got the money to do it and the will to do it? It could be business, so the Googles and the other big tech companies,"" he said. Cameron said that like other previous inventions, artificial intelligence could be weaponised. ""And if you're doing it for business, you're doing it to improve your market share or whatever your business goals are. So you're essentially taking a machine smarter than a human and teaching it greed. Or it's for defense, in which case you're taking a machine smarter than a human and teaching it to kill. Neither one of those has a good outcome in my mind,"" he said.

2017-09-26,SBI deploys AI-based financial solution SIA,Mayur Shetty,"MUMBAI: State Bank of India has deployed SIA , an artificial intelligence-powered software that has the capability to respond to 850 million queries a day , making it the largest-financial sector AI solution in the world. The AI banking platform has been provided by Payjo -a company based out of Silicon Valley in US and Bengaluru. SIA or SBI Intelligent Assistant is a multilingual chatbot which can respond in 14 languages in speech or text. In the initial three months, it will provide responses to standard queries like information on products and services and responding to frequently asked questions like ATM locations and IFSC codes. Speaking to TOI, Srinivas Njay , Payjo founder and CEO, said that in two to three months it will evolve to answering transactional statements like `What is my balance?', `Pay my telephone bill' or `Send money to mom'.“In the third phase it will be proactive in telling you that you are leaving money idle and will remind you of bills that are coming up for payments,“ said Njay . “India leapfrogged into the mobile revolution with many people adopting internet for the first time through mobile. The idea is, can we give all these people a simpler new way of interacting with the bank?“ said Njay . According to Njay , Payjo won the bid for SBI over other giants in the reckoning -IBM and other AI providers such as Nuance and [24]7. He added that this is the largest deployment of the AI platform after Google and Amazon. According to SBI chief technology officer Shiv Kumar Bhasin , SIA is the firstof-its-kind banking application in AI and conversational banking. “It will enhance customer service several notches above. Payjo's expertise in the conversational banking domain helped us build SIA as a superior chatbot in the global banking space,“ said Bhasin. According to Njay , India's banking infrastructure is ahead of the IT systems in the western world. “SBI has built an application programming interface (API) layer over its banking solution. We use the same layer to gather data,“ he added.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-deploys-ai-based-financial-solution-sia/articleshow/60835330.cms
2017-09-23,‘IBM reintroduced artificial intelligence to the world’,Ranjani Ayyar,"Chennai: Despite the recent criticism that IBM Watson has received, Sriram Raghavan, director, IBM Research India defends its applicability across sectors including healthcare, retail and financial services. Raghavan talks to TOI about how the field of research is changing rapidly with co-innovation, multidisciplinary application and blockchain. Exceprts: There has been a lot of discussion on whether Watson has delivered on its promise especially in healthcare . What is your view? I am not sure where the criticism is coming from. We reintroduced AI (artificial intelligence) to the world, we continue to lead in core technologies. Watson has been successfully applied in healthcare, financial service, retail, customer services, to name a few. Every technology takes time to mature till we can identify the best way to deployed it. But there is no reason to doubt the success of the technology. Hospitals in India and Thailand, banks in America, oncologists in Australia are using Watson. AI is still nascent and is emerging. We continue to learn that there are going to be more dimensions to AI like ethics and data security. The good news is that technology can be used to navigate such non-tech areas too. Do you think researchers are taken more seriously today? Yes, absolutely. While I can’t speak for other companies, in IBM, there is no part of the company that has not valued the work of researchers. We are empowered to innovate and disrupt. We are also asked to make recommendations to teams and the company has made bets on these recommendations too. Blockchain is an example of a suggestion made by IBM research. We educated the company and told the management that here is an opportunity and they have backed us. Blockchain is a major focus area for IBM. Tell us where Blockchain would be best applicable and IBM’s work in the area. Business networks where controlled sharing of sensitive information will benefit the overall ecosystem and partners – this is an example of where blockchain can be used. Take the example of supply chain finance where there is a financier, supplier and an original equipment manufacturer. If you bring these parties onto a blockchain platform, efficiencies from a time and cost perspective can benefit all parties. The beauty of blockchain is that it can bring partners, competitors and the regulator on a platform to share information that is mutually beneficial yet control what is shared. We recently announced a collaboration with 12 major food suppliers including Walmart, Tyson Foods and Nestle to identify new areas that can benefit through blockchain. For example, food safety is a major issue across the globe and all these companies know they can’t truly solve it on their own. If there is an issue with a product, the consumer will probably blame Walmart because they stocked the product. The fault could lie with the retailer, the distributor or the farmer. Micro- information through blockchain can help here. We are working with 7 European banks to build a blockchain platform for trade finance. IBM is also engaging with various regulators and governments. We recently worked with the tech arm of the RBI on a white paper related to blockchain. In Singapore, we have set up the IBM centre for blockchain innovation along with the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Economic Development Board. They see this as a transformational technology and we working them to realise this mission. We work with the smart Dubai office in their vision to become the first blockchain powered government.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ibm-reintroduced-artificial-intelligence-to-the-world/articleshow/60800702.cms
2017-09-08,AI makes voice recognition expand horizons,Ranjani Ayyar,"Chennai: Amy Lesner, a doctor, records her voice for medical transcription and converts them into text. “It helps with live audio input, as well as pre-recorded audio files and it saves a great deal of time,” said Lesner, who uses Brainasoft’s app. With voice recognition and speech to text conversion capabilities for over a 100 languages and accents, Brainasoft’s app is used by medical and legal professionals for multiple purposes including patient history transcription, drafting of documents amongst others. Initially adopted by the financial services sector, the technology is now finding applicability across the spectrum. “With accuracy picking up owing to artificial intelligence, voice recognition is finding varied applications. We have partnered with over 1,000 doctors and lawyers. In the last three years, we have grown 40% year on year,” said Akash Shastri, CTO, Brainasoft. For any consumer facing industry that has a call centre or customer support system in place, voice recognition is helping them derive insights into the calls coming in. “For an automobile major that gets hundreds of calls on its customer care number every day, speech to text capabilities helped them identify that the second largest reason for these calls were related to issues with the AC vent and mileage. For an airline company, Mondays saw an upsurge in calls coming in for issues related to refunds and cancellations which was deciphered through speech to text,"" said Umesh Sachdev, cofounder and CEO, Uniphore Besides the analytics, voice recognition is helping in improving the customer experience when they call a call centre. “Typically, you call and then have to press 1 for English, 2 for Hindi and so on. With voice recognition, when you call, the system can automatically speak to you in the language of your choice,” said Subodh Kumar, cofounder, Liv.ai. The company has signed contracts with companies in the banking, insurance space besides original equipment manufacturers (OEMS) and robotics companies to deploy their solutions. “We are working on a solution with warehouse automation such that one has to merely speak to the robot. Even simple commands like picking up and object and placing it in the right spot, if voice driven can save effort,” Kumar added. What players are betting on is the analytics behind voice to text. “Speech to text has the inherent ability to derive brand level insights. For instance, with a customer care centre, all the data can be broken down demographically or geographically to understand which age group or which area draws the most complaints,” said Sachdev. Speech recognition is also used in the e-commerce sector, with companies making calls to cash on delivery customers to confirm the order. “We have partnered with e-commerce companies, the sector being one of the latest adapters to the technology,”said Jyotirmoy Chakraborty, co-founder, Ubona.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ai-makes-voice-recognition-expand-horizons/articleshow/60414884.cms

How will machine learning change companies and how we manage them? AI will transform all the large tech companies and I think it’s surprisingly straight path for other companies outside tech too. A lot of CEOs have a certain idea of how to use AI to change their business but they might just not have AI talent to do the work they need. The challenge is how to find the ten or hundred AI professionals they need. Ideally, they would like to train their own employees in AI skills and technology but it was difficult till now. Deep learning is one extreme example of a technology that has risen very rapidly and a lot of companies are looking for ways to train up their people. More use of AI will lead to displacement of workers. How far are we from the first big wave of displacement due to AI? Right now, AI is at a nascent stage.

Though AI — that has been slowly redefining computer science research along with cloud computing — is a part of the existing academic courses, it lacks facilities for dedicated and stand-alone researches. Institute director P P Chakrabarti said, “We need Rs 20 crore to get started with the core infrastructure but later, it will also be linked with facilities such as supercomputing and cloud computing. Furthermore, we want to explore good projects in climate change, healthcare and AI that will require augmented funds.” “We have already started researching for AI. We are working on its framework and building the big as well as small aspects of the research that will consist several new programmes,” Chakrabarti said. According to sources, the institute has been exploring AI algorithms and machine learning to help deal with planning issues and complex data. The centre is expected to provide a boost to such researches. The director also indicated that the institute is planning to give more impetus to research in science and heritage as part of its Sandhi (science-culture) initiative. “Through the Sandhi centre, we intend to document, promote, disseminate and modernise classical and folk art and music.

The college entrance , lit up in green and blue, welcomed performers and students alike to the fest themed “Upside Down”. Day one had a lineup of renowned speakers on subjects as varied as stocks and cinema, and ended with musical performances. It began with the keynote speech of Ashish Kumar Chauhan, MD and CEO of the Bombay Stock Exchange, who spoke on the evolution of technology and artificial Intelligence. Soon after it was the turn of Viren Rasquinha, ex-captain of the Indian hockey team and CEO of Olympic Gold Quest, to narrate his experiences. The afternoon was for two panel discussions; the first on artificial intelligence and the second on cinema and theatre featuring the likes of veteran actress Shabana Azmi and director Homi Adjania. The evening brought the chamber ensemble of the Symphony Orchestra of India, led by Evgeny Bushkov. It was a performance that actively engaged the audience, which was encouraged to bleat collectively like goats to a piece on the animal. The performance later received a standing ovation from the crowd. Siddharth Basrur, composer and backup singer in films like ‘MS Dhoni: The Untold Story,’ followed on the guitar singing his composition “Stay” which he used to woo his wife and “Bad Words” from his current project “Runt”. The day drew to a close with enthralling performances by Uday Benegal of Indus Creed singing the band’s iconic piece “Fireflies” and by Vivian Fernandez, who will also play on Sunday. “Everything went smoothly on day one,” said Behram Kapadia a member of Malhar’s administrative team. The annual event brought with it the human barricade chains and color coded t-shirts as Xavierites sat around helping visitors get around. The next two days are likely to see an influx of participants from various colleges at the festival.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/artificial-intelligence-reel-real-life-stories-start-malhar/articleshow/60040561.cms
2017-08-02,The rise of AI: Exciting or scary?,Mohammed Waseem,"In the past couple of weeks, a lot has been written and spoken about AI Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fascinating field not just for the immense potential it holds, but also for the ultimate ego boost it can give humans — enabling us to play god and create something that can think for itself. In the past couple of weeks, a lot has been written and spoken about AI — right from billionaire inventor Elon Musk ’s suggestion that governments need to start regulating AI right right now because if left unaddressed, they can pose a ‘fundamental risk to the existence of civilization’, and Internet entrepreneur Mark Zuckerberg ’s response to that, to tech giants developing self-learning softwares as well as AI engines that started communicating with each other in their own ‘secret’ language. As an industry, AI is on high-growth mode — analysts predict that the global AI market will be close to $23 billion (Rs 1.48 lakh crore) by 2025. While many across the world are excited about how it can revolutionize and automate the way we do things and our very lives, there are also a number of naysayers for the tech. Take, for example, the recent exchanges between Elon and Mark, both pioneers in the field of technology and innovation. At the National Governors Association meeting in USA few weeks ago, Elon, who has in the past compared work on AI to ‘summoning the demon,’ spoke about being exposed to cutting-edge AI that people should be really concerned about and that regulation of AI need to be proactive, and not reactive, because of its unique nature. This evoked a response from Mark Zuckerberg, who, in one of his live videos, said, “I think that people who are naysayers and try to drum up these doomsday scenarios… I don’t understand it. It’s really negative, and, in some ways, I actually think it’s pretty irresponsible.” Mark’s argument is simple — any technology can be used for good or bad and that it’s up to inventors to innovate with caution. And that’s where Elon doesn’t see eye-to-eye with him, as is evident from the tweet he later posted, claiming he’s spoken to Mark about this and that the latter’s understanding of the subject is limited. The thing about AI is that it is exciting and scary in equal parts — exciting because of the possibilities it could offer, and scary because of the limited understanding most of us have of it. There have been recent developments that support both feelings. On one hand, a tech giant’s AI, DeepMind , taught itself from scratch how to walk and run in virtual spaces, using reinforcement learning — incentivizing the agent to move from point A to point B using a set number of sensors and abilities. No specific instructions, such as using its legs or arms, were given to travel across the obstacle-riddled surface, so the AI taught itself complex behaviours of running and navigating around them. Although the technique it employed was unique (and hilarious), it showed what it was capable of. On the other ‘scary’ hand, there have been reports of a company shutting down one of its AI engines after developers discovered that it had created its own unique language that humans couldn’t understand. The intention of the programmers was for two robots with different goals to negotiate with each other in English over a trade, and it seemed to fail when they started communicating in gibberish. But soon, programmers found out that the ‘secret’ language had its own rules and that some of the negotiations even were concluded successful in the new language! While these examples might be extreme, and Elon’s comments a bit too apocalyptic, what it has done is draw some attention to an under-examined, but crucial topic. Given how young the field of AI is, people in the scientific community doubt if there will ever come a time when an artificial, conscious, super-intelligent entity will take over our world, especially in any of our lifetimes. But that’s not to say it can never happen. As famous English author PG Wodehouse wrote in one of his books, “Comrade Spiller, never confuse the unusual with the impossible.” Is it unusual that humans might let another (artificial) race take over them? Yes. But it is impossible? Definitely not!",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/the-rise-of-ai-exciting-or-scary/articleshow/59865278.cms
2017-07-19,"Number crunchers in demand as data, AI startups see potential",Ranjani Ayyar&Aparna Desikan,"CHENNAI: With a PhD in mathematics, Bharat Ramakrishna was preparing content for school children when suddenly he found a well-paying job in the machine learning & data sciences space. No longer is a mathematics background purely academic. Maths majors are now in demand for a job in artificial intelligence and data sciences. “After graduating from the University of Utah , I was into preparing question banks for students. Now, concepts such as matrices, linear algebra and calculus are being used in artificial intelligence and it is easier for a mathematics graduate to learn coding than vice versa,” said Ramakrishna, data scientist at Skillenza. Ramakrishna, who has seen a 20% increase in the remuneration from his earlier job, says that the current job also offers a better learning curve and application of concepts learnt. A background in mathematics helps the engineers understand algorithms, which form an essential part of artificial intelligence in machine learning. Graduates in statistics and computing are also seeing jobs in data sciences. “Today, every other company wants a math-oriented student. We see a lot of demand from financial services where companies are looking for someone who comes with math and finance integrated background,” said Rajeeva L Karandikar, director, Chennai Mathematical Institute. As demand exceeds supply, Karandikar says traditional math programs are not equipped to prepare students in taking up industry positions. “Areas like data science , big data, analytics are on the lookout for math students. However, a big shift in the curriculum is required,” he said. “A math graduate doesn’t have too many options besides research and academics. With the support of the industry, universities can do much more to prepare these students,” he said. Retail tech company Capillary Technolgies is on the lookout for maths graduates and currently has interns from students pursuing post-graduation in mathematics and computing at IIT Kharagpur. “We have made pre-placement offers to them and these interns who know maths and programming do well. They will join us once they finish their course,” said Subrat Panda , principal data scientist, Capillary. Realising the need for understanding in math and computing, engineers take up short-term courses to have a basic understanding on statistics and coding. “About 70-80% of the applicants are engineers and we have seen a high demand since we launched the course on data analytics that has statistics and coding in its syllabus. They are generally strong in coding, but they are generally weak in basics of computation,” said Mayank Kumar, co-founder, Upgrad. Another area that has employers scouting for math talent is blockchain. “Blockchain involves a lot of prime number theory and other math concepts. There is a big need for number theorists in this space,” said Karthik Iyer, founder, Blockchainmonk.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/number-crunchers-in-demand-as-data-ai-startups-see-potential/articleshow/59656524.cms
2017-07-06,Dearth of AI talent make cos scout for candidates abroad,Aparna Desikan,"Chennai: Amid IT layoffs, techies with conventional skills are being handed pink slips. Artificial and Machine Learning jobs, on the other hand, are in demand, which go largely unfulfilled and some companies are looking at hiring freelancers for higher pay or importing talent from the west as the skill gap is huge. Chatbot startup Niki.ai has hired three non-resident Indians or foreign nationals from China, UK and the USA in their team. “We have a lean team already, with fewer members who can provide the required skill needed. Since ML is a newly-evolving field, the universities here do not have the syllabus in place yet. It would be a couple of years before we get good talent pool in AI & ML,” said Nitin Babel, co-founder, Niki.ai, who adds that the quality is improving. Venturesity, a community hiring startup that recruits through hacking sessions finds the need for deserving talent growing. ""Companies have been asking to hold AI and ML based hackathons every month, but only close to 30% of the positions are filled with deserving candidates “said Subhendu Panigrahi, co-founder, Venturesity. Panigrahi adds that the company has conducted 5 hackathons so far and a lot of the candidates lack aptitude in mathematics and statistics, which is essential for expertise like this. Industry sources say that, the entry-level talent is better, whereas only 1 in 20 applicants are up to the mark among the experienced candidates. Multilingual AI-based startup Vernacular.ai also finds better talent among fresh graduates, who have been sensitised to the future of AI. “For those spots requiring experienced talent, we compromise by hiring software developers who are not as competent and train them,” said Sourabh Gupta, co-founder, Vernacular.ai Subrat Panda, principal architect at Capillary Technologies, finds fresh graduates from tier 1 colleges -- the IITs and NITs ---competent enough to solve low-level problems, but for vacancies for candidates with an experience of 3 years or higher, for every 20 applications received, 1 fits the bill. “To build talent pool in AI, communities such as Indian Deep Learning Initiative have been helping interested engineers build their capability in machine learning and deep learning. Talks from industry experts and useful links help the community grow, “he added.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dearth-of-ai-talent-make-cos-scout-for-candidates-abroad/articleshow/59462359.cms
2017-06-29,Nagpurbot: An artificial intelligence based app to guide newcomers in city,Abha Goradia,"Nagpur: For any newcomer in the city, navigating through various needs is now going to seem easier. With the help of Nagpurbot application on Facebook messenger app, which functions based on the concept of artificial intelligence, the user will find several features aggregated for their convenience. Users will be able to book metro train tickets, or instantly book a hotel room or pizza. They will also get Nagpur’s weather updates and will be guided about its tourist places, shopping venues, hospitals, movie screens and its emergency control rooms. All of this, without downloading further apps. The user will be directed to the websites through links which will direct the user to websites such as Weather.com, bookmyshow, Uber, ola, Dominos, YouTube, Wikipedia and so on. The method is simple: Search Nagpurbot on Facebook messenger, and type ‘get started’. Then, click on ‘features’ to see various options. This application has been created by 18-year-old medical aspirant from Chandrapur Harshawardhan Ramteke, along with five others — Chinmay Naik, Shashank Phatkure, Karan Chikate, Apurva Ramteke and Karan Tiple — who belong to the same age group. “As of now, we have only received the alignment map from the Metro officials. We are further coordinating with them in order to be able to book metro tickets through our app. Our app is a support to the smart city project,” he says. Work on the app was started on 1st November last year, and on November 20, he made the app’s base model. In a unique move, the app will bring together all roadside eateries who are well-known for what they serve. “When I came to Nagpur, I didn’t know where I could go to eat. So I ordered a pizza from a famous outlet. I later found a street seller offering Manchurian for Rs50. My app will guide all newcomers about chowpatty areas around the city, what to eat, and from where,” says Ramteke. Above all this, a female assistant named as ‘Natasha’ has also been developed to allow users to have a friendly chat. Users will also be able to join others through various chat rooms. The app will run based on funds from advertising. Ramteke, who turned a Facebook developer out of sheer interest, plans to get volunteers by integrating e-cells of engineering colleges in order to boost the ecosystem. Ramteke says he hasn’t so far invested in the app, and targets users in the age of 18-45 years. The latest features were added on May 22, and the app will now be updated every month. Only 25 per cent of the app has been developed so far. “We want the users to try the app, and based on their queries, we’ll add more features to it. Artificial intelligence cannot be self-developed. As more minds engage with the app, we will be able to transform it, the way Google has been functioning since 2005. In Nagpur, most people don’t know what Facebook can do. 1,000 minds can together make Nagpur an excellent city,” Ramteke adds.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpurbot-an-artificial-intelligence-based-app-to-guide-newcomers-in-city/articleshow/59359848.cms
2017-06-28,"IBM to engage with developers on AI, machine learning",PTI,"New Delhi, Jun 26 () Tech giant IBM is looking at engaging with developers in India in areas like artificial intelligence, machine learning and Internet of Things (IoT) to help them hone their skills for new technology trends. As part of its efforts, IBM is conducting roadshows in three cities of Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad from June 28 to July 1. ""We are working with developers all over the world. From India's perspective, we think it is the right time for developers to work on technology areas like AI, ML, data science and we want to help them in their journey,"" IBM India/SA Country Leader Developer Ecosystem and Startups Seema Kumar told . She added that apart from relevant tools, developers are also provided with mentorship and guidance for their projects. ""Through the roadshow, we hope to reach out to hundreds of developers in these cities,"" she said. Kumar said other interesting areas where IBM sees potential are IoT and hybrid cloud. Using IBM technology, say for example Watson , developers can come out with solutions that can help solve problems in not just their community but also in others, she said. IBM's Watson is a cognitive artificial intelligence platform that can analyse huge amounts of data. It understands natural language and can help businesses take decisions. Watson shot to fame after winning television game show 'Jeopardy' in 2011. It is now being used across sectors, including assisting in treatment of cancer. ""Using the best of cognitive and cloud technologies, we want to empower these developers to innovate and build next- gen startups and enterprises,"" Kumar said. According to industry reports, India will have the world's largest developer base by 2020. With three million programmers in the country, India alone is expected to develop 10 per cent of all apps by the end of 2017.

2017-06-23,"Dress codes to mood swings, startups say AI",Shubhra Pant,"Gurgaon : Imagine you saw the latest Bollywood chart-topper have fallen in love with the outfit worn by the lead actor. You want the dress, but don’t know where to buy it. Fret no more. Thanks to artificial intelligence (AI), you can now use an app or software to find that dress online within seconds. Gurgaon-based start-up Staqu has developed a solution that helps customers buy anything they see in a picture or video with the help of AI. Once the user feeds the video (or still) to the app, the AI engine breaks it down into frames, then uses face recognition algorithm to identify the celeb. It then spots the most appropriate frame with maximum visibility for the apparel, then uses localisation to find where in the frame it appears, and finally searches for it online. “From the around 1,800 frames in a 5-minute video, the engine takes seconds to pick up the right frame, run the algorithms and throw up results. The input is data, which is converted into algorithms to fetch results,” said Atul Rai, co-founder of Staqu. He added results would improve based on data fed into the engine. Every AI engine runs on similar algorithms, but use of the technology would vary according to data fed to the programmes. For instance, Neuron, another Gurgaon startup , is using AI to do sentiment analysis. To put it in simple words, their AI engine can find out the user’s mood using text or voice. “The technology uses the text or voice (which first gets converted into text) to analyse a user’s sentiment,” said Veer Sharma, co-founder & CEO. The team is in touch with leading chatbot (robotics-based chat applications) companies, which could use the technology to augment their personal assistant to play a certain statement, depending on the user’s mood. Neuron is working with big names in the finance and banking sectors. Their product is being used by many e-commerce firms to analyse feedback for a product. The programme does that by analysing thousands of user comments and finding out how many people had positive feedback and how many reviewed it negatively. Even though e-commerce happens to be the favourite experimental field for AI startups, it has crept into offline retail as well. Corseco, founded by Arush Kakkar, Vivek Singh and Aditya, is an AI engine that analyses video content to help brands assess customer behaviour, such as their loitering time in a store, their gaze matrix and a heat-map analysis of their most visited area in the store. Their team is working with some of India’s leading retail brands. “The software reads CCTV footage and uses the data to throw results about customer behaviour. It could include things like a customer’s most favourite section in a store, or how long they gaze at a product,” said Singh, COO and co-founder. As applicability of AI increases, many city-based start-ups are now experimenting with new uses of the technology, venturing into new sectors like healthcare and fintech. However, their applicability is restricted because of the risk factor involved. Even though Gurgaon still lags behind the likes of Bangalore in the number of AI startups, the city’s ecosystem is fast warming up to the new technology. In 2016, 13 AI start-ups came up in Gurgaon, with total funding received by them around Rs 1.6 crore.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/dress-codes-to-mood-swings-startups-say-ai/articleshow/59124648.cms

The open platform called ‘ Rygbee ’, which is a start-up developed by a research team at Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT), Gandhinagar, acts as a notebook where one needs to draft or just key in their research ideas in whichever order or form and the AI algorithm immediately picks up relevant phrases and tries to understand their context. The platform can also suggest you a list of peers or academics who may be pursuing the same research interest. Today, Rygbee has more than 7,500 active users every month and has presence in 103 countries. Assistant professor at DAIICT, Sourish Dasgupta , said, “Rygbee has a unique embedded algorithm that learns human thought and keenly records the researcher’s thought evolve in the process. The platform is quite personal. The AI in Rygbee analyzes the interactions of the researcher with the search results. Rygbee pulls up for the researcher and then hones its future search based on the feedback given to it once the researcher starts selecting materials from the search results.” Dasgupta and his team are improving the Rygbee’s algorithm which in future can even predict what directions a research idea will take in future. The Rygbee platform integrates peer groups, provides the researcher with light reads on subjects and searches extensively on Wikipedia. The software also can collect video lectures and also suggest books or an upcoming event nearby pertaining to your research nearby",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/now-researchers-have-a-guide-powered-by-artificial-intelligence/articleshow/59209676.cms
2017-06-18,"'AI can help doctors fight cancer, but it’s not meant to replace them'","Updated: Jun 18, 2017, 13:19 IST","From mining medical records and designing treatment plans to developing precision medicines, artificial intelligence (AI) is playing a bigger role in healthcare. Shobita Dhar spoke to Rob Merkel , general manager of oncology and genomics, IBM Watson Health , about how the cognitive computing system is working with clinicians, researchers, businesses and governments worldwide, and in India, to solve healthcare challenges that range from cancer to diabetes. How can AI help the doctor? There is an overwhelming amount of information available to physicians today. In oncology alone, there are more than 160,000 studies published each year. Yet there are few tools to help doctors draw meaning from this knowledge. With training, AI technologies like Watson are assisting physicians to summarise patient records and synthesise the vast body of medical data — from clinical records to medical literature to genomics and even data from wearable devices like the Apple Watch — so that they can deliver personalised, evidence-based treatment options to their patients. Can over-dependence on machines make doctors complacent and lazy? The responsibility for medical decisions ultimately lies with the doctor. Just as physicians have relied on textbooks in the past, a technology like Watson can help doctors make more informed, data-driven decisions, but it is not intended to supersede their expert judgments. Manipal Hospitals in Bengaluru has been using Watson and a recent study showed that the supercomputer suggested the same treatment options as the hospital’s oncologists in 96.4% of 362 cancer cases analysed. This is quite a high accuracy. How was this achieved? After winning the TV quiz show Jeopardy! in 2011, Watson began training at Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) Cancer Center in New York , one of the world’s leading cancer institutes. The resulting platform, Watson for Oncology, went through rigorous training and testing with MSK before it was released for any given cancer type. (It is currently available to support breast, lung, colorectal, gastric, ovarian, cervical and prostate cancers.) So it’s not surprising that these MSK-level opinions frequently matched Manipal Hospital’s multi-disciplinary tumour board. How well are oncologists responding and adapting to AI? Watson for Oncology is already in use in 13 countries. Oncologists are sceptical of almost any new technology, but when they experience Watson directly, they are impressed. A University of North Carolina oncologist who used Watson for Genomics has said it can analyse genomic data and surface an accurate list of targeted treatment options in mere seconds — a task that generally requires hours of time from a molecular tumour board. An oncologist from the Mayo clinic shared that the amount of time to screen a patient for clinical trials was reduced from 30 minutes to 8 minutes. What are the limits of AI in medical care and what can go wrong? Doctors should always be at the centre of patient care decisions. AI can go wrong when an underlying assumption is made that it can replace human judgment. Watson is a valuable tool for clinicians — not a replacement for clinicians. We provide insights to oncologists in a very transparent manner so that they can directly access relevant patient information or medical literature which supports these insights. Will technologies like Watson mean a need for fewer doctors and nurses thereby reducing healthcare costs? It is physically impossible for doctors and nurses to read the amount of information to stay current in their profession — there are not enough hours in the day. Watson provides an opportunity to partner with doctors and nurses to assist in analysing this information so that they can spend more time with their patients. It is also our hope that Watson can help doctors and nurses deliver efficient and effective care to their patients during the increasingly short period of time available for patient visits. This is especially important in markets like India where there is only one oncologist for every 1,600 patients.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/ai-can-help-doctors-fight-cancer-but-its-not-meant-to-replace-them/articleshow/59196056.cms
2017-06-11,Indian IT needs to reinvent itself for the age of automation and AI,TOI Contributor,"By Vivek Wadhwa “Carnage in Indian IT,” read a headline about retrenchments in its outsourcing industry as markets stagnate and US visa restrictions erode profits. The Indian IT industry generates $150 billion in revenue but is facing an existential crisis largely of its own making because it became complacent and overconfident even as technologies and markets changed. It can survive only if it exits the business that brought it success and reinvents itself. India’s outsourcing boomed during the Y2K crisis of the late ’90s because there was an urgency in repairing corporate IT systems. Once chief information officers (CIOs) became comfortable with having their systems maintained across the globe, they started outsourcing large-scale projects to Indian companies, and billion-dollar contracts were announced almost every week. But with the advent of tablets and smartphones and their applications in the 2010s, users gained access to better technology than the companies’ IT departments could provide. They could download cheap, elegant and powerful apps on their tablets that made their corporate systems look primitive. Via cloud computing, companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google began to take over the functions of data centres. So CIOs lost power, and the importance of outsourcers declined. The billion-dollar outsourcing contracts evaporated. Modern-day applications also don’t require large teams of software engineers. They are user-customisable and can be built by anyone with basic programming skills. To offer more value, outsourcers worked to reduce costs by improving backend processes. They offered low-cost offshore development and cheap labour in the US, and this fomented a backlash by displaced workers. The same tech advances that decimated the Indian advantage offer a new opportunity that could allow Indian IT to reinvent itself and even gain the support of Americans who have been rallying against it: to help the US modernise its aging infrastructure and bring manufacturing back from China. Technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence and sensors enable development of smart cities and automated factories and a wholesale upgrading of national infrastructure. Robots, for example, have advanced so far that they can now do the work of humans in manufacturing. With computing advances and dramatic price drops of hardware components, robots have acquired the dexterity to assemble circuit boards and build cars. They now cost less to operate than the wages of workers in China. And connected devices and sensors in the Industrial Internet of Things enable monitoring of every aspect of a manufacturing plant’s operations. China is well aware of the threat and is taking the lead in building zero-labour manufacturing plants, with robots doing practically all the work. But its robots have no advantage over American robots; all work equally hard and consume nothing more than energy. Manufacturing can now return to US shores without raising costs. However, American businesses aren’t geared to take advantage of manufacturing robots because they simply don’t have the know-how. This is where India’s outsourcers could help. They could master the new technologies and help American firms design new factory floors and program and install robots. They could provide management consulting in optimising supply chains and inventory management. And they could manage manufacturing plant operations remotely. This is a higher-margin business than the old IT services. And Americans would cheer India for bringing manufacturing back to their shores rather than protest its taking their jobs away. No, there won’t be as many jobs in each manufacturing plant as there were before. But many new high-paying jobs would be created to build and manage factories. It is also possible to build smart cities, where sensors monitor every aspect of a city’s functioning. Their design and installation require managerial and analytical skills; their monitoring functions are no different from those of managing data centres. And then there are opportunities to create applications that can revolutionise fields such as healthcare and education and to build technologies for the underprivileged — something that Silicon Valley ’s entrepreneurs don’t focus on because they don’t understand the dire needs. These are all things that Indian IT firms can do. It is not that Indian companies don’t realise the threat. Tech Mahindra ’s chief executive C P Gurnani told my class at Carnegie Mellon’s College of Engineering on May 1 that he was working hard to change the focus of his company from services to technology products and to solve problems outside IT. He talked about rapidly changing markets and the urgent need for his company to build offerings in areas such as healthcare, manufacturing, retail and managed services. Will India’s IT sector finally wake up and smell the opportunity? It remains to be seen. One thing is for sure: the backlash will build if it doesn’t — and Indian IT will accelerate its decline into oblivion.

While lay-offs in the IT (information technology) industry have been the talk of the town, he sees opportunities here too. Dupuis talks to TOI about his new role, the India market and sectors that are hiring in large numbers. Excerpts: Why are you positive about India? There are a lot of factors that are working in favour of India right now. The working age population is huge. To give you context, Japan, has an ageing society and low GDP (gross domestic product) growth. India, on the other hand, is recording solid GDP growth, a rising middle class and emerging sectors. Another fact that is hard to measure in numbers is the ambition and hunger I see in the youngsters in this country. Lately, the IT sector has been taking about layoffs and downsizing. What are your clients saying? I am meeting with CXOs everyday and the sense I get is that everyone is anxious. Many see opportunities too. When one sector sees a correction, which the IT sector is going through right now, it creates opportunities for another. The good thing for IT professionals is that they are agile and adaptive by nature. This will hold them in good stead. Our clients are telling us – give me someone trainable, well-rounded and professionals who are 360- degree thinkers. Corporates want professionals who have skill sets that are transferable. Where are the new jobs being created? A lot of sectors are generating new jobs in India, not just from Indian businesses but MNCs who see opportunity. For example, Ikea has huge plans for India, not just with setting up outlets but sourcing too. Another area that is drawing interest is clean energy. Digitisation and e-payment is a standalone industry now and is offering tremendous scope. Jobs are being created across the spectrum from point of sale level to the backend infrastructure and hardware level. A lot of startups in the HR space are employing new age tech like artificial intelligence (AI). Do you feel threatened? We welcome more players. When LinkedIn launched several years back, people asked if we were concerned. Today, we have a global partnership with LinkedIn and we work very closely. Not only has it created more jobs within Randstad, it has also helped with the front end of the funnel, to long list candidates etc. We are in the people business. Bots, AI cannot replace human touch. All these technologies enable our people to give better service to our clients. We take active interest in these technologies and companies that employ them. Through Randstad Innovation Fund, we have invested in over 10 companies, several of them in the area of new age tech.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bots-artificial-intelligence-cannot-replace-human-touch-says-randstad-india-head/articleshow/58917472.cms
2017-05-29,Infy's AI platform Mana became Nia due to SAP,Shilpa Phadnis,"BENGALURU: In San Francisco last April, Infosys pulled the wrappers off a new artificial intelligence platform, which it called Mana , amid much fanfare. The platform enabled repetitive tasks to be automated and glean insights from data. But the fanfare was short-lived. German software behemoth SAP, where Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka previously worked as chief technology officer (CTO), came down heavily on Infosys, saying Mana sounded similar to SAP's in-memory database platform Hana, and described it as a trademark violation. SAP is said to have taken serious objections to Infosys selling Mana in Europe in particular, saying the brand name similarity was causing confusion in the minds of key customers. Hana also provides, among other things, real-time analytics. SAP gave Infosys time till April to address the issue. And hence Mana became Nia last month, and Infosys presented it as a new upgraded system. Both SAP and Infosys confirmed that trademark-related concerns had been raised. ""SAP and Infosys are pleased that the companies have been able to mutually resolve all concerns regarding the use of their respective trademarks. Following the announcement of Infosys Mana, SAP raised concerns about the similarity of the name to SAP Hana. In the interest of the larger partnership with SAP, Infosys has agreed to discontinue the use of Mana over a period of time. SAP and Infosys believe this will help strengthen the organisations' strategic partnership, while maintaining focus on delivering business value for their clients,"" the two companies said in a statement. Some people who spoke to TOI also said there were architecture similarities between Hana and Mana that SAP took exception to. But the companies declined to provide any statement on that. For Infosys, the stakes were high as it has one of the largest SAP practices among the Indian IT services companies, estimated at over $1 billion. Mana was an AI platform that pulled information locked inside source codes, maintenance logs, applications and tickets, and was clubbed with machine learning capabilities. The early adopters of Mana included Johnson Controls, and Syngenta. Within six months of its launch, Infosys said that client adoption of Mana had risen rapidly and it was being used to detect fraud and risk management. Mana had also found new customers in Kraft Heinz and AMD . Mana has now been rechristened as Nia. Nia, the company said, ""is its next generation AI platform that converges the big data/analytics, machine learning, knowledge management, and cognitive automation capabilities of Mana; end-to-end RPA (robotic process automation) capabilities of AssistEdge; advanced, high-performance and scalable machine learning capabilities of Skytree (Infosys acquired this California-based machine learning firm); and optical character recognition (OCR), natural language processing capabilities and infrastructure management services."" Earlier this month, in an interview to TOI, Sikka said Nia has more than 50 productive engagements (deployments). He said it was deployed recently in a bank in Asia ""where we replaced the work of some of the lawyers."" US-based Everest Research, which recently evaluated different AI platforms including Mana from an infrastructure services lens, said Infosys needs to build a more sophisticated value proposition for Mana, focusing more on the strength of the business value it delivers to the client rather than just productivity and cost-effectiveness.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/infys-ai-platform-mana-became-nia-due-to-sap/articleshow/58887605.cms
2017-05-24,When robots get ‘personality’ to boost insurance sales,Rachel Chitra,"Chennai: Insurance sales and retention has always been about personality. And insurance companies today are investing more in artificial intelligence (AI) to ensure their robots have it in them to hook customers. Insurance companies are investing big-time in artificial intelligence. From VR humanoids like Kushi — PNB Metlife’s insurance personal assistant to HDFC Life’s launch of an email bot ‘SPOK’ — insurers are leveraging the power of AI, chat bots, robotics, natural language processing. Imbued with ‘personality’, HDFC Life’s SPOK can read, understand, categorise, prioritise and respond to customer emails within milliseconds — something that the insurer hopes will help in reducing costs and improving customer experience. HDFC Life with startup Senseforth aims at getting SPOK to help it identify deeper insight on customer needs and identify trends and patterns based on interactions. Something that usually pays off rich dividends like in the case of insurance aggregator EasyPolicy.com. At EasyPolicy.com. bots its co-founder Neeraj Aggarwala says have helped site traffic and navigation enormously. “Today, the customer gets fazed at times by information overload. And it is not just customers, but our own staff as well. To expect customer service personnel to know every single deal, discounts, add-ons, additional riders, benefits on every single policy would be near impossible and also quite tiresome. With a bot — there is no question of training 200 plus call centre executives. It is a one-time effort with multiple dividend — as the bots can handle hundreds and maybe even thousands of customers — while customer care representatives can deal with only one customer at one time,” says Aggarwala. And it is an improve customer experience that players like HDFC Life are looking at with their email bot. “SPOK will help us increase our operational efficiency and we are excited to see how these interactions with our customers provide us inputs to enrich their future experience with us,” says Subrat Mohanty, senior EVP, HDFC Life. A question with bots is will they offer advice or information in clipped, metallic tones or can the conversation be pleasant and informal. HDFC Life says, “SPOK is designed to mimic human cognitive abilities in reading, comprehending, interpreting, and conversing. One of the key proficiency is gauging customer emotions,” added Mohanty. Another key reason why insurance companies and aggregators have started looking to bots is the high attrition rates faced by the industry. With attrition rates on average between 30-35%, chat bots, VR assistant would prove a key differentiator in terms of cutting costs, reducing manpower and improving efficiency; given the infinite amount of data the bot can process, say experts.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/when-robots-get-personality-to-boost-insurance-sales/articleshow/58813833.cms
2017-05-24,"Analytics, AI drive personalisation in CRM, says Genesys CTO",Ranjani Ayyar,"Chennai: Powering over 25 billion customer interactions ever year, US-based Genesys’s technology offers omnichannel customer experience to over 10,000 customers across 100 countries. Slava Zhakov, CTO, Genesys talks to TOI about new age technologies that the company is deploying to ease customer interactions. How is analytics and AI is changing customer experience? Analytics and AI gives us the ability to create more personalisation. Say you are browsing your bank website late night looking for options to transfer money to a recipient in another country. There are two options but you don’t know which one to pick. When you call the bank next morning, the Genesys software identifies who you are and predicts what you could be calling for. An automated voice guides you to someone who is proficient with the area where you need help. The agent is simultaneously sent information on what you could be calling for and is able to guide you. Say the call disconnects. You immediately get a call from the agent and the conversation continues. It’s a pleasant and shortest possible resolution for the consumer, and it saves cost for the enterprise. These technologies also facilitate better connect between consumer and resource. We have a product that offers predictive matching, taking parameters of the consumer and the agent to drive better experience and business outcome. For example in the case of a banking customer, we consider past interaction duration, no of calls, balance in the bank account etc. Say, in a span of 3 months, there were atleast 5 calls every week on a particular issue, we could use that intelligence to help the next customer. Tell us about your speech and text analytics tool. If you are talking to the bank representative and are progressively getting angrier, we can escalate it to the next level. The senior can then silently move in and coach the agent. Our tool will transfer the call if the threshold of excitement goes above a particular level. If the customer says something like - I am going to close my account – the call will be escalated. Our technology can not only identify cue words but analyse phrases and context of the conversation. For example, if a customer says, “I was so frustrated when I called you but I am satisfied now. Thank you so much.” Most systems will detect the word ‘frustrated’ and escalate the conversation. Our technology will analyse the phrase and identify that the customer is actually happy. We are also able to train agents and define good and bad habits using the millions of conversations that we facilitate every day. A supervisor can easily select two similar conversations by an agent and help him understand which he handled better. The tech helps in assessing the agent based on historical data and real time. If an agent is routinely capable of addressing a particular issue, the next time a query comes up, we can route it to them. There a lot of CRM players like Zendesk , Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics. How is your business different from theirs? We provide infrastructure and intelligence to connect consumers and enterprise. When consumers make a phone call or chat or send an email, Genesys understands who the customer is, the context of the conversation and connects the call to the most appropriate resource. CRM provides records and a database of customers and their details. We provide the communication and intelligence. We frequently integrate with CRM systems on the customer side. For example, we are partnering with Salesforce, Microsoft CRM, Zendesk, SAP and Oracle CRM.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/analytics-ai-drive-personalisation-in-crm-says-genesys-tech-cto/articleshow/58813764.cms
2017-05-22,Why startups think AI is antidote to poor diagnosis,Anand J,"Radiologists, technicians and doctors are hard to find in small towns, so entrepreneurs are using machine learning and artificial intelligence to bridge the gap BENGALURU: As a researcher at Xerox Research Centre in Bengaluru, healthcare researcher Geetha Manjunath always wondered why thermal images weren’t used to detect breast cancer. “I thought it would be a non-invasive, non-radiation and non-intrusive method,” she says, adding that some women are reluctant to have regular mammograms. She spent three years doing her research and analysis and in 2016, co-founded Niramai, an artificial intelligence-based healthcare startup which uses thermal imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) to screen for breast cancer. Niramai has signed up a couple of hospitals for its subscription model. More than a billion diagnostic tests are done in India every year in thousands of small labs and centres, many without the right equipment. A shortage of radiologists, pathologists, technicians and doctors, especially in small towns, means the results are rarely read accurately or explained to the patients. And that’s where entrepreneurs are stepping in, using machine learning and artificial intelligence to bridge this gap. Nirmai founders Geeta Manjunath and Nidhi Mathur Prashant Warier, founder of Qure.AI, a healthcare startup building deep-learning solutions to help physicians with routine diagnosis and treatment, says technology can improve efficiency and productivity of the healthcare system. More than 100 companies are applying machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics to reduce drug discovery times, provide virtual assistance to patients, and diagnose ailments, according to data from CB Insights. Deals in healthcare-focused AI startups rose from less than 20 in 2012 to nearly 70 in 2016, it says. In India, research consultancy Zinnov says 169 startups are working in the AI space. Venture capitalists have invested $36 million in the sector, it says. “People are waking up to AI and hospitals and doctors are ready to experiment. AI in healthcare also reduces the cost for patients,” says Warier. Qure.AI algorithms can simultaneously look for and diagnose 15 diseases. “Every time we make a correction in the system after intervention, it learns from it, just like humans study and correct themselves,” says Warier. While doctors and radiologists might take up to an hour to make a diagnosis, the algorithms can do it in under a minute. Most startups are in the diagnostic space. “For India, it is the most relevant space and an easy first step for an AI company. Treatment comes later. There is a lack of good diagnosis options in smaller towns,” Warier says. Bengaluru-based SigTuple is building intelligent screening solutions to aid diagnosis through AI-powered analysis of visual medical data. It is focussing on five major high-volume, screening processes of the healthcare industry — analysis of peripheral blood smears, urine microscopy, semen, scans and x-rays. Founders Rohit Pandey, Tathagato Rai Dastidar and Apurv Anand spent two years on research and learning before they were ready for a commercial launch. “The initial thought was to use intelligent data for social impact, and healthcare was a big sector. Most of our initial research was on publicly available data to identify abnormalities,” says Pandey. SigTuple partnered with local diagnostic centres that were willing to share samples. “The machine was given as much data as possible to reach 100% accuracy in predicting abnormalities,” says Pandey. The company’s board comprises healthcare experts, doctors, ethics and legal experts, and pathologists to corroborate the machine’s learnings and results. Investors do have reservations about the scalability of such businesses and the time taken for such products to gain wide acceptability. “These startups will take five to seven years before they can meaningfully scale,” says Manish Singhal, co-founder of Pi Ventures, a fund focused on supporting AI startups. He says the companies will be ready for sizeable funding in a couple of years. “While developing AI software in itself is not capital and human intensive, the deployment or operations are often cash burning,” says Singhal.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/startups/trend-tracking/startups-health-ai/articleshow/58765763.cms
2017-05-03,GlobalLogic eyes buyouts in cloud and AI space,TNN,"Hyderabad: US-based product design and engineering services provider GlobalLogic, that has offices in India including three in Hyderabad, is looking at snapping up companies in the area of cloud and artificial intelligence, GlobalLogic India managing director Sumit Sood said. GlobalLogic has acquired seven companies since its inception. “We have not made a single acquisition for revenues. It has been to acquire skills or expand/enter markets. Cloud is a big area as we have a lot of work with clients, right from helping them build cloud platforms to helping a lot of products become cloud compliant … we are very aggressively looking at that space. Artificial intelligence and machine learning too are a big part..,” Sood said. In the area of cloud, he said the amount of work that needs to be done globally is massive as there is demand for solutions around data privacy, security and risks, among others. Speaking about the new sectors, where the company is seeing a lot of traction, Sood pointed to retail, CPG (consumer packaged goods) and F&B (food and beverages) that are increasingly trying to leverage technology to engage with millennials to offer personalised services. “In the marketplace of billions, address the market of one -- this is the problem statement that a lot of the clients are coming to us with,” he said. While retail, CPG and F&B segments are growing for the company, GlobalLogic has been mainly focussed on three areas -- communication & automotive, medical equipment & healthcare and media. The company has a global headcount of 11,000, of which over 6,000 are in India. Hyderabad accounts for over 2,800 employees. The company has around 200 clients.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/globallogic-eyes-buyouts-in-cloud-and-ai-space/articleshow/58503939.cms
2017-04-30,'Devise backup minimum income schemes for those losing jobs due to automation',Jaideep Shenoy,"MANGALURU: With the Indian IT and other industries facing some of the daunting challenges from protectionism in the US and Artificial Intelligence (AI), an ASSOCHAM-PwC study has made out a strong case for government –industry schemes which ensure a minimum income to those displaced , along with basic health facilities for the families in stress. It said there are concerns in a number of industries related to loss of jobs , arising out AI and robotics and the solution lies in facing the issue upfront and skilling up the country’s human resource. “In light of technology advances, certain sectors are expected to experience shrinkage of employment demand as robotic systems and algorithms take up several tasks. It can be expected that IT, manufacturing, agriculture, forestry etc will experience such a demand shift,” the study noted. Quoting Oxford University researchers Carl Frety and Michael Osborne, based on 702 occupational groupings, workers in tele-marketing, hand sewers, mathematical technicians, insurance underwriters, watch repairers, cargo agents, tax preparers have a very high probability of being replaced by automation. The ASSOCHAM-PwC Paper suggested that even though the churn arising out of automation would throw new opportunities, certain basic cushion must be given to those who may get affected by the AI and robotics and other automation technologies. The paper made a strong case for universal benefits outside employment structures. “If a large number of people end up unemployed for extended periods of time, there needs to be a way to provide healthcare, disability and pension benefits outside employment”. It also sought a minimum income to sustain households. “In the event of continuous unemployment or underemployment, government schemes to provide a minimum level of income to each citizen to guarantee basic needs are necessary to keep them out of destitution. Proposals must be structured in a way so as to maintain a balance between benefits and incentives for engagement – for example by involving the unemployed in social and community initiatives”. The ASSOCHAM–PwC Paper said the traditional academic curriculum is not well equipped to cater to technological advancements. “The sequential system of education and work is outdated in an economic environment that is heavy on automation and deskilling of jobs and where skills gain and lose value within a few years. What is required is a continuous skill improvement system that does not depend on the sequence of the skills imparted to young minds”. It sought creation of separate funds by the companies for skill re-training of employees. “Companies can contribute a set amount to an individual’s fund which can then be transferred as the individual switches jobs. The goal of such an initiative will be to incentivize lifelong education and upskilling”.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/devise-backup-minimum-income-schemes-for-those-losing-jobs-due-to-automation/articleshow/58441061.cms
2017-04-05,"No job losses due to chatbots, AI: Banks",Mayur Shetty,"Mumbai: The financial sector in India is driving investments into chatbots and artificial intelligence (AI) to augment customer service, but bankers are convinced that there would not be job losses as these new tools will only complement staff. When it comes to AI it is not upstarts but big guns of banking with resources, which are driving investments. State Bank of India (SBI) is working with IBM to make use of Watson — an answering computer software to assist staff and employees. HDFC Bank has tied up with artificial intelligence firm Niki (funded by Ratan Tata and Ronnie Screwvala) to bring in conversational banking. Last week, Yes Bank partnered Payjo to launch AI-led digital initiatives. Among other things, the bank is looking at AI solutions based on speech recognition. The bank has also launched Yes Tag—a chatbot-based app to seamlessly engage in chat banking on five messaging platforms: Facebook Messenger, Twitter, Skype, Telegram and WeChat. SBI is also looking at using artificial intelligence to address some of the standard requests at call centres. “We find that chatbots are useful for employees. For instance, if an employee has entered a particular screen and does not know how to proceed, the software will sense inactivity and a bot will pop-up offering assistance,” said Mrutyunjay Mahapatra, deputy MD and chief information officer, SBI. According to Nitin Chugh, digital banking head HDFC Bank, the website chatbot has seen one lakh conversations in one week, with the bot concurrently running 700-750 conversations. Chugh, however, points out that bots are not there to replace customer executives but to complement them and to provide customers with a richer experience. “In any case the routine queries are moving to the self-service mode. Most of the calls now pertain to when the caller is worried about a transaction and wants to speak to a human,” said Chugh. ICICI Bank has found success in using chatbots for answering queries on remittance to India. “In remittances using Swift we have noticed that customers are always concerned on whether the money has reached the beneficiaries banks account. The queries are standard,” said B Madhivanan, chief technology and digital officer of ICICI Bank. The bank is also using artificial intelligence to replace “dumb search” on its website with something that is more intuitive. Madhivanan said, “We are still at level one when it comes to the stage of maturity. The next level would be the equivalent of Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa.” According to Ritesh Pai of Yes Bank, the future capacity addition at call centres might taper off as standard queries can get addressed by bots. The advantage of using technology to answer customer queries is that there is a high degree of standardisation in responses, he adds. Insurance companies, too, are catching up. Earlier this month, HDFC Life launched the first life insurance chatbot in collaboration with Haptik — a conversational commerce platform powered by chatbots. The company said that the bot would recommend best suited plans after quizzing the user for 60 seconds. Couple of days later, Birla Sun Life launched a chatbot, which it claims, was much faster than any other customer touchpoint and can instantly generate a quote, register a claim, and can engage in a natural conversation with the customer to help them understand coverage details better. Another insurer PNB MetLife Insurance launched Dr Jeevan — an AI-powered interactive chatbot solution on Facebook messenger that provides information on health. In the NBFC space, Fullerton became the first to launch a loan acquisition and fulfilment chatbot — Asha.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-job-losses-due-to-chatbots-ai-banks/articleshow/58017753.cms

Latest data collected by the Indian wing of the Silicon Valley-based edu-tech startup, Udacity, Hyderabad, shows a rise in terms of the demand for specialised online tech courses.Artificial intelligence, deep learning, android development, machine learning, data analyst, full stack developer are some of the courses people in the city are now taking up. “This increased interest in learning specialised skills is a result of changes happening in the IT industry now and the slow recruitment and appraisal season across the sector this year,“ said Ishan Gupta, managing director, India, Udacity . Data collected by the online course provider shows how Hy derabad stands fourth in the country, after Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai, in terms of the demand for these courses. “Companies are hiring employees for specific projects and periods, after which they can be benched or let go. Presently, in Hyderabad, there are instances of many employees being benched for months altogether, after completing a particular project. An employee's chances of landing internal vacancies within the same company depends on whether or not they are ready to expand their skills and learn specific technologies to fit any profiles the company has on offer. Eve ry resource the company hires should be ready to undergo cross-training or multi-skilling,“ said Pallavi S, who is in charge of talent management at several IT firms in the city. According to Vijay Ranganeni , chief executive officer of Tech Mahindra BPO , introduction of specialised courses in engineering college curricula will help. “There is enough demand for professionals with a new skill set in fields such as cloud computing and data analytics. Training people in these niche areas must be at the college level itself, by introducing specialised courses in the curriculum,“ said Ranganeni.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cheer-fizzles-out-silicon-valley-staff-beef-up-cv-with-tech-courses-artificial-intelligence-big-hit/articleshow/57834812.cms
2017-03-08,Zoho venturesmoves into AI with ‘Zia’,Ranjani Ayyar,"Chennai: For the last three years, the brightest minds at Zoho Corp have been at work on a stealth project. Experimenting with a bunch of ideas surrounding machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), the Sridhar Vembu-led company last week announced Zia, an AI powered sales assistant. COO Mani Vembu talks to TOI about their work, what to expect from Zia and its application. Excerpts: When did you start work on Zia. Why has it taken you so long to launch an AI tool. About 2-3 years ago, we started toying with AI. We wanted a compelling reason to use AI and give value to the customer. In its formative years, CRM was just a contact database. When integrated with email, CRM evolved into communication. In July 2016, we launched a multichannel CRM tool to cover all aspects of communication be it email, social media or telephony. Now, with Zia, we are empowering the sales person by giving them actionable intelligence. How does Zia work? It is still not easy for sales teams to manage leads and customers. With Zia, the CRM database is used to identify anomalies and predict best time to call. We track the customer’s online movement and know what time would have the highest probability of the customer responding. For example, we can see what time of the day a customer typically raises a support query. If the marketing team sends a survey or an email, we can tell which is the most probable time that the customer responds. You would think that their action is random, but there is a pattern to it. Zia suggests 5 best time slots for a sales person to contact a customer. If a customer is using a product at a particular time, there is high probability that they will be open to connecting with the sales person. So does Zia mimic a sales person? Will it reduce workload? Sales person have routine, repeated actions which consume time and effort. Zia will suggest actions based on prior data, personalised to each employee. For example, if a customer does not receive a call and it goes into voice message, Zia will suggest that an email be sent. For team leads, Zia will give updates on the performance of a sales personnel. The idea is to leave the predictable portion to the machine and increase productivity. Will we see AI proliferate into other Zoho products? How is the business doing? We want to have AI across the board soon. We are beta testing internally and an AI tool for all Aoho products should be out after a year or so. Majority of the work is being developed in Chennai with a small team from Tenkasi. We are looking at new products in the area of payroll while expanding our communication suite. Our strongest sell point is that our company and its 4,500 people run entirely on Zoho products. This is testament to our products being a complete suite for all business needs.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/zoho-venturesmoves-into-ai-with-zia/articleshow/57525176.cms
2017-03-05,'Flippant use of tech terms makes investors cautious',"Mar 5, 2017, 04:15 IST","In this column, young entrepreneurs ask questions about issues they have encountered while building their ventures, and we get them answered by seasoned entrepreneurs and investors. You too can tweet your questions to @TOIStartups Question from Tanay Dixit, co-founder, Talespin, AI-based image service for retail sector While investors are generally excited about AI, deep learning and chatbots, many remain cautious. How do you separate the hype from the fundamentals? How does a pitch help differentiate this? Answer by Girish Shivani, co-founder, executive director and fund manager, YourNest India VC Fund The problem arises from the fact that most startups use these terms very loosely. There is a perception that a few buzzwords like AI, blockchain, machine learning and chatbots are sexy and brighten the chances of funding if these are included in pitch decks. However, most active investors are fairly conversant with what these technologies are, and their use case or application in a particular domain. This flippant use of terminology is the primary reason why investors are cautious when it comes to evaluating and investing in this space. The other is the lack of access to large enough datasets to actually build an AI solution for a particular use case. Typically, such solutions are co-created with end users and are iterative in nature, hence time consuming. The only practical way to separate the grain from the chaff is to deep dive into the use case and understand what AI elements or components have been deployed in the technology solution. Some commonly used AI components include NLP, knowledge extraction, image processing and statistical techniques like deep neural networks to make the system self-learning. The other litmus test is the presence or absence of data scientist(s) as part of the core team. Without seriously qualified resources, it is really difficult to build and scale up an AI solution.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/startups/people/doubtfire-ai-investors-startups/articleshow/57466935.cms

2017-02-11,Ford to Invest $1 billion in Artificial Intelligence Startup,AdAge,"Ford Motor Co. is investing $1 billion over the next five years in artificial intelligence startup Argo AI to help build the brains of its robot cars. The Pittsburgh company, founded last year, specializes in robotics and virtual driver systems. It will compliment Ford's autonomous vehicle team that's preparing to market a fully self-driving car in 2021. Argo was founded by Bryan Salesky, formerly of Google , and Peter Rander, formerly of Uber. Both are alumni of the Carnegie Mellon National Robotics Engineering Center and left their respective companies late last year to form Argo AI. ""When talent like that comes up, you don't ignore that availability,"" said Raj Nair, Ford's product chief and chief technical officer. ""This really increases the robustness of our ability to deliver this vehicle in 2021."" As part of the investment, Ford will become a majority stakeholder in Argo. Mr. Nair and John Casesa, Ford's group vice president of global strategy, will sit on Argo's five-person board. By the end of this year, Argo will have offices in southeastern Michigan and California, according to Ford, along with its Pittsburgh headquarters. It will employ more than 200 workers at the three sites. A yet-to-be-determined amount of Ford employees will transition to working for Argo, executives said. Related Stories Ford's Super Bowl Ad Is About a Lot More Than Car Sales Ford's Futurist Foreshadows Consumer Trends to Watch in 2017 Ford says the software it develops with Argo could potentially be licensed to other companies. During a conference call with analysts and reporters on Friday, CEO Mark Fields noted the investment could also include an IPO. ""There's potential to create significant value in the company,"" Mr. Fields said. The investment in Argo is the latest in a string of moves by Ford to offer transportation alternatives to the traditional car and truck -- a mainstay of the company since its founding. Last March, the automaker created a Smart Mobility subsidiary to invest in emerging mobility opportunities as it targets more services outside traditional car and truck ownership. Later in 2016 the subsidiary purchased Chariot, a San Francisco-based on-demand shuttle service that has since expanded to Austin, Texas. Ford recently said Chariot would expand to eight cities by the end of 2017, including a city outside the U.S. Ford has also invested in LiDAR-maker Velodyne; 3D-maps-maker Civil Maps; machine vision company Nirenberg Neuroscience and computer vision and machine learning company SAIPS. Ford has not released the financial results of Ford Smart Mobility, although a financial category labeled ""all other"" -- which includes Ford Smart Mobility and its Central Treasury Operations -- lost $867 million last year, up by $71 million compared to 2015, according to a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ford says interest expense accounts for the majority of the unit's losses in 2015 and 2016. Ford expects 2017 pretax profits to be less than the $10.2 billion it earned in 2016 because of increased investments in mobility services. Mr. Nair said Argo will strengthen the company's virtual driver assistance team already in place. Ford has been working on autonomous vehicles for a decade before last year disclosing plans to develop a fully driverless car -- without a steering wheel or gas and brake pedals -- for commercial use in 2021. Mr. Nair said Friday that Ford was ""beyond the research phase"" in developing the car, but noted there's much more advanced engineering that needs to take place. Ford is testing autonomous cars on public roads in Michigan, California and Arizona.

2017-01-20,"Infosys 'releases' 9,000 employees due to automation",Avik Das,"BENGALURU: Infosys has “released“ 8,000-9,000 employees in the past one year because of automation of lower-end jobs, the company's human resources head Krishnamurthy Shankar said. He said these employees are now working on more advanced projects. ""We have been releasing about 2,000 people every quarter and also training them in special courses that will help them in their new assignments,"" Shankar said on the sidelines of an event organised by the Bengaluru chapter of Global Shapers, a body backed by the World Economic Forum . Shankar, who joined from Philips in 2015, added that with automation set to increase in intensity , the number of people it hires will come down over time. It's actually coming down already , though all of it may not be a reflection of automation and is likely also to be the result of the company not doing as well this fiscal as it expected. Infosys added 5,700 people in the first nine months of this fiscal, compared to about 17,000 in the same period last year. In the December quarter, Infosys' total employee strength actually declined -an extremely rare occurrence for India's No. 2 IT services company . The total strength fell by 66 to 1,99,763. Most big IT services companies are investing heavily in automation of processes in their traditional businesses like BPO, application management and infrastructure management. Wipro has an automation platform called Holmes. The company's global HR head Saurabh Govil said in November that some 3,200 people were released through automation to do more innovative work. The target is to take that figure to 4,500 this fiscal. Such initiatives are helping companies improve their operating margins. Shankar said Infosys has trained about 490 people in a first batch of machine learning and the use of artificial intelligence (AI). Machine learning and AI previously required expensive computing machines, but costs have now come down dramatically.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/infosys-releases-9000-employees-due-to-automation/articleshow/56678827.cms
2016-12-28,"HDFC Bank, Niki.ai tie up for chatbot banking",Mayur Shetty,"MUMBAI: HDFC Bank has tied up with Niki.ai , the artificial intelligence firm funded by Ratan Tata & Ronnie Screwvala, to bring in ‘conversational banking’ — chatbots that facilitate commerce and banking transactions without getting out of the chat window. The chatbot is presently available on Facebook messenger where it can be used for e-commerce transactions like booking a cab, ordering food or paying bill. Speaking to TOI, Nitin Chugh, HDFC Bank’s digital banking head, said that the chatbot was designed to work as a virtual concierge service. The HDFC Bank on-chat app is available to anyone and not just those with HDFC Bank accounts. “The chat opens a payment gateway through which transactions can be made using any bank account,” said Chugh. “In social media, the chatbot will facilitate e-commerce transactions. For instance, if you ask it to book a cab, the bot will get your location and look for cabs available with different aggregators,” said Chugh. He added that a similar chatbot will be available within the bank’s log-in page and facilitate ‘assisted net banking’ transactions without having to navigate deep into the website. “With over 71% of our transaction taking place on digital platforms, we no longer call this as an alternate banking channel. Internet and mobile are now our core channels,” said Chugh. He added that while some other banks are talking about how demonetization is kick-starting digital banking, for HDFC Bank it was a booster shot to an already growing channel.In May this year, Ratan Tata and Roni Screwvala’s Unilazer Ventures picked up stake in Niki.ai. The start-up had raised funds to increase its merchant base. The company was founded a year earlier by four IIT-Kharagpur alumni. HDFC Bank is not the first to use a chatbot for conversational banking. Earlier, DBS had introduced a virtual assistant to help customers use their app-only bank account Digibank. The Singapore-based bank has tied up with US firm Kasisto, which is hived off from SRI International — creator of Apple’s voice bot Siri.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-bank-niki-ai-tie-up-for-chatbot-banking/articleshow/56209605.cms
2016-12-24,KMC to deploy artificial intelligence system for cancer detection,TNN,"MANGALURU: To provide continued access to world-class treatment to the people of Mangaluru, KMC Hospital announced the launch of a new block at Dr B R Ambedkar Circle. The new block, which is equipped with state-of-the-art multidisciplinary facility to cater to people with all types of ailments, will be inaugurated by defence minister Manohar Parrikar on Sunday. Dr Krishna Prasad, medical oncologist at KMC Hospital Mangaluru, said, “On the occasion, the IBM Watsons for oncology will be inaugurated at the hospital. “The supercomputer uses artificial intelligence as a tool for diagnosis and treatment of cancer,” said Dr Prasad. Manipal Hospitals is only the second hospital chain in the world to deploy the technology, the first being Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre , New York,” he claimed. The supercomputer ranks the treatment options available and provides links to supporting evidence for each of them. ""It can process the patient’s genomics data and case history and come out with tailor-made recommendations in 60 seconds ,"" added the oncologist. “One can even find out the success rate of a treatment option, the possible side effects and toxicities of drugs, with the help of Watson Oncology. We formulate our treatment plan based on this feedback,"" he noted. Dr Prashantha B, adult hemato oncologist at KMC Hospital, said other cancer centres in the country may also start using Watson oncology soon. “They can access it online and take an opinion. Patients are the ones who are going to benefit the most from this,'' he said. Dr Sourjya Bannerjee, radiation oncologist at KMC Hospital, said cancer is enormously complicated. “Breast cancer, for instance, has some 64 treatment protocols. Which protocol to follow depends on a range of factors including the patients’ age, fitness level, state of body functions, genetic profile, stage and type of cancer,'' he said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/kmc-to-deploy-artificial-intelligence-system-for-cancer-detection/articleshow/56145620.cms

2016-11-18,"WOW: Artificial intelligence is coming soon, to a device near you",Vikas Singh,"Las Vegas : Marvin is just a few inches tall, but he has a big mouth. “What do you think of that, human?” he sneers as he ties the scores 1-1. “Is that the best you can do?” he jeers as he takes a 2-1 lead. Moments later, his tone switches to pleading. “Oh no, IBM will fire me if I lose,” he says, as the score is tied 2-2. The decisive move comes up, and Marvin is beaten. “My robot mind is officially blown,” he intones, making a fizzing sound as the audience laughs and claps. The game the cute little robot was playing — Rock, Paper, Scissors — has been played by children for generations. But when this seemingly simple game is played hundreds of times, it throws up a wealth of data that can be crunched to come up with complex strategies. Marvin has played it over 600 times with human rivals already, and every time he plays, he learns. “You won’t beat me again,” he tells one of the humans who is walking away triumphantly. It’s meant as a joke, but one suspects that there may be an element of truth to it. Marvin is one of several devices, including Pepper, a robotic concierge, Olli, an interactive, self-driving minibus made of 3D printed parts, and Rita, an intuitive whiteboard that provides transcripts of meetings taking place in the room, and also offers translations on request, that were on display at IBM World of Watson ( WOW ). The three-day conference, attended by over 17,000 people, was essentially a showcase for Watson, IBM’s ambitious, multi-billion dollar bet on artificial intelligence, the new frontier that every major tech giant — from Amazon to Google to Microsoft — is racing to explore. IBM, though, insists that Watson is more than just AI, and prefers to use the term ‘cognitive’ when referring to Watson’s capabilities. Unlike conventional computers, which have to be programmed, Watson understands the world in the way that humans do: through senses, learning and experience, but at a speed no human can match – it can read more than 800 million pages per second. Unsurprisingly, India plays a key part in IBM’s plans, both as potential market and talent pool. “The biggest developer conference that happened (for the company) this year was in Bengaluru. We’re planning another one there soon. There is just amazing talent that we see, so I am very excited about it (India),” said IBM Watson GM David Kenny. “We see a lot of innovation coming out of India... There isn’t much legacy that needs to be adopted, so people are immediately deciding cognitive systems,” he added. Watson first shot to fame in 2011 when it beat two human champions in the quiz show, Jeopardy. More recently, it assisted Grammy-winning music producer Alex Da Kid in creating a song called “It’s Not Easy”, which was released last month. During a discussion with IBM CEO Ginni Rometty at the conference, Da Kid revealed that the song had already gone to No.1 on Spotify. He declined to perform it live, quipping that he was “very expensive”, but said he planned to collaborate on at least three more songs with Watson. But while the fun and games — and song and dance — get the headlines, Watson has become a significant presence in healthcare, particularly in the treatment of cancer. John Kelly III, senior vice-president of Cognitive Solutions and IBM Research, predicted, “In three to five years, every single medical professional is going to want to consult Watson.” Rometty went further in her keynote address, saying that Watson had “already achieved critical mass”. Stressing that Watson is not so much about artificial intelligence as “augmenting intelligence” (of the human kind), she said Watson already touches the lives of 200 million consumers, and this figure is expected to touch 1 billion by the end of 2017. One of the drivers of this growth is expected to be IBM’s tie-up with General Motors to provide OnStar Go, an interactive system with Watson embedded in it, which will learn from the driver’s behaviour to offer personalised suggestions and experiences. These could include avoiding traffic when you’re low on fuel, then activating a fuel pump and paying from the dashboard; while ordering a cup of coffee on the go. The announcement was made jointly by Rometty and GM CEO Mary Barra in a power moment that featured two of the world’s top businesswomen together on stage. “Smartphones are such an essential part of our lives. Imagine having the same level of connectivity, but from your vehicle,” said Barra. “People spend so much time in cars. Just imagine if you could utilise that time in a safe but productive way.” Rometty was quick to add that OnStar Go will be available in some new GM models from 2017 itself. She ended her keynote address by declaring, “We are at a critical inflection point, not just in technology but in history. I believe that Watson will help to change the world.” Sceptics will dismiss that as hyperbole; a CEO pushing a product on which her company has placed a huge bet. Given the pace of tech transformation, we should know soon enough whether Watson, and other artificial intelligence platforms, succeed in living up to their promise. But if they do, then stuff that is today still science fiction could be everyday reality within three-five years. To borrow a line from Marvin, “What do you think of that, human?” (The writer was at the World of Watson conference at the invitation of IBM)",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/wow-artificial-intelligence-is-coming-soon-to-a-device-near-you/articleshow/55484896.cms
2016-11-11,"Lakshmi, country’s first banking robot, makes debut in Chennai",Rachel Chitra,"CHENNAI: Endearing, interactive and superfast with data, India's first banking robot Lakshmi made her debut on Thursday in the city. Launched by the Kumbakonam-based City Union Bank , the artificial intelligence powered robot will be the first on-site bank helper . Top private lender HDFC Bank, which is also experimenting with robots to answer customer queries, is testing its humanoid at its innovation lab. Lakshmi, which took more than six months to develop, can answer intelligently on more than 125 subjects. Want to know your account balance? Interest rates on home loans? Deferred payments or possible charges to be incurred on fixed deposit closure? Lakshmi can answer it all. “Apart from answering generic questions, we have also programmed it to connect to the core banking solution. If a customer wants to know his bank account details or transaction history, the robot can flash the answer on its display,” said N Kamakodi, MD and CEO, City Union Bank. Sensitive financial information like account details are displayed discreetly on the robot’s screen and not voiced. “Lakshmi only talks out loud on generic subjects. If you visited our branch with your girlfriend, she won’t embarrass you by showing your low account balance,” joked its CEO. Lakshmi, who currently speaks in English, gestures, turns around and engages in a very life-like manner in conversations. Unlike most robots her speech is not formal, but more relaxed and casual. ""Since its artificial intelligence, the robot is constantly learning from customers - the more interactions it has with customers the better it gets,"" said a bank executive. And what if a question stumps Lakshmi? ""She then asks you to get in touch with the branch manager. But at the back-end, we will be collecting all the questions she was unable to answer and equip her with better data sets, so she can service customers. Today she can give real time updates of foreign exchange movement, current interest rates at banks for different asset classes like personal, educational, two-wheeler and home loans, possible charges on withdrawals or deposits. But going forward, she might be able to more than that,"" said its assembler Vijay V Shah of Coimbatore-based Vishnu Engineering. In the next few months, City Union will aim at programming the humanoid to greet customers in Tamil. ""We are also looking at enabling it so that it can service visually challenged individuals. Worldwide very few banks employ robots at branches and we want to bring a whole new experience to India,"" said CEO Kamakodi. Currently, the bank has readied only one version of Lakshmi and has plans for 25-30 robots deployed at key branches by the end of the year if Lakshmi proves a hit with customers. The bank was planning on Lakshmi's debut on Thursday at its T.Nagar branch. But given the rush due to the demonetization drive and customers thronging the branches for exchanging withdrawn notes, Lakshmi might go public only on Monday.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/lakshmi-countrys-first-banking-robot-makes-debut-in-city/articleshow/55361225.cms
2016-09-04,Bhubaneswar Development Authority to set up 5 more open-ai r fitness centres in parks,TNN,"BHUBANESWAR: At a time when lifestyle diseases are taking a toll on people, the Bhubaneswar Development Authority (BDA) is taking steps to create open-air fitness centres in parks. People can avail themselves of the facility free of cost. The BDA will set up five more open-air gyms at five parks. It had set up such facilities in 10 parks earlier. ""Apart from the five gyms, we will have indoor multi-gyms at Madhusudan Das park, Pokhariput, Kharvel park, Khandagiri and Buddha Jayanti Park and Niladri Vihar,"" said BDA vice chairman Krishan Kumar. The new outdoor fitness centres will be different from conventional gyms as they will have a wide variety of exercise equipment for the elderly, children and youths, Kumar added. People visiting these parks will be able to use them easily as they have been installed at strategic locations like the walking track and rest shed. "" We also have plans to open two skating rings in the city parks, one at Madhu Sudan Das Park and another at Buddha Jayanti Park. Currently, we are developing parks at Nayapalli N-3 and N-5 and K-6 at Kalinga Nagar, Sailashree Vihar Phase III, Gayatri Vihar and Ananta Vihar,"" said a BDA official The Smart City Project will also have components like Satyanagar Institutional Core Redevelopment Project, Integrated Comprehensive Mobility Plan and upgradation of traffic signal system i and a lot of progress has been made in this regard , the official said. The BDA had recently set up a high-end gym at Indira Gandhi park, which is spread over 3,000 sq ft. ""We have spent Rs 40 lakh on constructing the building for the gym. It is fully air-conditioned and has a number of hydraulic equipment for different exercises. We have kept trained personnel to guide the people coming for exercise,"" said another BDA official. The IG park sees a footfall of more than 2,000 people every day. Fitness freaks have welcomed the move of the BDA.

2016-08-29,"Soon, robot to greet you at HDFC Bank",Sidhartha,"NEW DELHI: Over the next few weeks, you may encounter a robot at a branch of HDFC Bank as the country’s second largest private sector lender tries to match Japanese players that have launched humanoids. Taking a cue from Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which launched a robot named Nao last year, and Mizuho Bank’s Pepper, HDFC Bank has launched ‘Project AI ’ ( artificial intelligence ) where the first product is now ready for deployment. Sources said the plan is to introduce the robot, whose name is being finalised, in one of HDFC Bank’s branches and, based on the experience, the project may be scaled up. So, where will it debut? The plan is to deploy it in one of the branches in Mumbai first, certainly one that does not deal with too many senior citizens who need personalised service. Unlike Pepper, which analyses customer behaviour and provides a variety of services, HDFC Bank’s first robot will only perform a limited role, acting largely as a receptionist. Sources said that it will greet a person entering the branch with options such as cash withdrawal or deposit, forex, fixed deposits and demat services displaying on the screen. Once the customer punches in the selection, a layout of the branch will appear on the screen with a “Take me there” option. While the initial plan may look a little basic, the bank plans to expand the menu to include voice recognition and facial recognition technologies and link it to consumer behaviour pattern. “If someone has enquired about a home loan through the website, the robot will generate the information when he visits the branch the next time and provide options,” said a source. The source added that the robot will be the first AI product from the stable, while recognising that globally too it plays a small role and in no way replaces crucial banking functions. So, if you thought that the relationship manager may be a thing of the past, the bank clearly doesn’t think so.

2016-08-27,Banks use artificial intelligence to prevent frauds,Rachel Chitra,"CHENNAI: Buying on Amazon, Flipkart or Snapdeal always comes with the prompt ‘Do you want to save your card details?’ A question that poses a lot of risks — at the merchant gateway, bank and customer end — irrespective of whether it is a large retailer or your neighbourhood florist and confectioners. For banks, customers using e-commerce sites poses the debate of convenience versus security. With convenience comes lesser steps and faster buying, but higher security would mean multiple authentications and more time — so to strike a fine balance between the two — Indian banks are now looking at software products like FSS' Access Control, geo-fencing of accounts and rule-based access. “What it means is, if you use your card at an ATM in Chennai and in the next 5 minutes your husband tries to buy a product online from an e-commerce site from Delhi — the card could get blocked or ask for further authentication. With artificial intelligence, the system could sense this is an unusual transaction because the same card is being used within 5 minutes at locations more than 1,000 kilometres apart,” says Suresh Rajagopalan, president products, FSS. Banks now have the capability to set rules to ensure that any unusual transaction gets blocked or requires multiple authenticators. At National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), a fraud management solution is being developed for all banks to bring in rule-based and risk -based analytics. The idea is to study customers' buying patterns and trigger alerts in the system if there are unusual transactions. Real time decline (RTD) is not yet a reality in the Indian banking ecosystem, but banks have already taken the first steps towards this to ensure consumer protection. “With real-time decline, what will happen is suspicious and unusual transactions will not be allowed to go through. But currently what we have in place is rule-based, risk-based access,” says Puneet Kapoor, executive vice president at Kotak Mahindra Bank. One of the peculiarities that banks have noted about fraudsters is that they attack around midnight, when banks reset the debit card limits of customers. “Say there are two transactions occurring between 11.50 pm and 11.55 pm, and a third transaction is attempted it will get blocked. Then our customer care executives will try to contact the customer to check. Banks have different limits for different cards schemes like gold, platinum, silver — and fraudsters try to benefit from the nightly re-setting of limits that happens,” says Kotak Mahindra's Kapoor. Another check that banks are trying to bring in via products like FSS' Access Control is device fingerprinting. “Your device (mobile/laptop) history and data has as many unique qualities about it as your fingerprint - it is unique and original to you. With the support of hardware security module (HSM) based data encryption, a digital signature is generated. So when someone tries to withdraw money from a device that is unfamiliar to the system it can throw up a warning,” says FSS' Rajagopalan.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/banks-use-artificial-intelligence-to-prevent-frauds/articleshow/53881247.cms
2016-08-16,"AI will be the most defining technology for banking industry: Ravi Narayanan, HDFC Bank",Sneha Jha,"With the emergence of a host of digital technologies, the banking industry is facing a series of Uber moments. In an interview with ETCIO.COM, Country Head -Branch Banking & Retail Trade FX Business, HDFC Bank explains how technology is revolutionizing the banking industry. Q. How do you create a culture for positive digital innovation within the bank? HDFC Bank has 80,000 employees. This is like a microcosm of the country. Our staff is the test bed for all the digital initiatives that we roll out. We have been testing out a lot these digital solutions on our employees- some with a great deal of success and some with not so much success. Chillr, PayZapp, missed call recharge are some of the offerings that saw a great response from our test bed. In fact, all the digital initiatives rolled out so far have been testbed super successes. Q. ‘Chat’ is the new black. Chris Messina, inventor of hashtag called 2016 the ‘Year of Conversational Commerce’. How is HDFC Bank planning to move to ‘Conversational Banking’-the digital equivalent of visiting a bank branch and talking to the banker? Chat bot is an evolving stream. There’s a lot of talk of AI but we still need more clarity of how does one use it for the benefit of the consumer. I can create a fancy chat-based interface but if it's doesn’t get consumer acceptance then it serves no purpose. It is very important for any organization to create confidence in what they are putting out to the customer. I can create AI based chatbots into the system but if you ask the bot what is the locker timing in the branch X and it is unable to give a cogent answer or it gives a generic answer to the customer query then the experiment falls flat. We do recognize that conversation-based engagements/platforms are very crucial and we are moving towards that. Our in-house chatbot Eva needed more work. It was not being able to mine the data or information in such a way to create a user experience which will be a moment of truth for the customer. We are now having domain experts helping us in this field. We organized the Digital Innovation Summit in March where we invited a couple of fin tech companies and start-ups to collaborate with us in areas of emerging technology. As a part of the program, we have collaborated with an AI based start-up Senseforth to help us develop our conversation- based platform. I am sure in the next six month you will be able to see a more enhanced chat related services being offered by HDFC Bank. Q. How do you see mobile wallets evolving as a payment mechanism? Anything that aids and abets convenience for a customer saves administrative cost- direct or indirect, is good enough to be excited about. Wallets created some buzz but it has not sustained because maybe the customer is still not able to capture that convenience. He is not able to catch that hook. Maybe something else is required for wallets to gain consumer acceptance. Some buffing or polishing is required on that front. Digital wallets have not mushroomed or blossomed into something that it was felt to do. If you have a debit card and you can use it at the POS machine to pay, then why would you use a wallet where you have to first put money into a wallet, use your phone to do that and if you realise that there is no money in the wallet then you need to fund it. The customer experience has to be seamless. That’s how PayZapp is different. It directly draws from your card and it's a one-click payment. You don’t have to create a virtual wallet and fund it from time to time. I am not deriding wallets but its time has not yet come because of the way it has been constructed. Its construct doesn’t seem to be sustaining customer interest whereas sheer common sense will tell you that as I move out of a petrol pump if I tap and pay and go, it’s exciting. That’s probably something that’ll have an emotive appeal to a consumer. Q. Which are some of the evolving technology trends that you are excited about? Technology by itself cannot to anything. The customer has to accept it and then sustain a change in consumer behavior. So the technology has to be so overwhelming that both these things happen. I am most excited about AI. It is the most defining technology that’ll impact business. Unfortunately, in our country, the inherent database of consumers is very poor but programs like Aadhar and the regulator’s push on creating credit bureaus, there is now a repository of information and this will aid AI. AI is all about playing around with data which a malleable and can be dipped into for information. This will create a change in the way technology can be used. AI will give salience to my decision making. We are very gung ho about conversation-based chat bots. Eventually, they will be an inalienable part of financial intermediation business and e-commerce where it will intelligently suggest what people should purchase. But currently, none of the organizations are able to create an ‘aha’ moment. AI will evolve as we go along. Any such technology has a development cycle.Near Field Communication or tap- and- pay kind of elements will gain prominence. They have not yet blossomed into an acceptable norm primarily because our merchants seem to be a little cagey in terms of acceptance.Going forward, the consumer’s acceptability of new technology will get sharper and sharper. Their ability to discriminate between good technology and not- so- great technology will get better. Banking will be supported by clean data. And when all of this will be put together, the consumer will have the best of times in terms of his ability to take a decision on a financial need.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/startups/people/ai-will-be-the-most-defining-technology-for-banking-industry-ravi-narayanan-hdfc-bank/articleshow/53725021.cms
2016-02-09,New energy-friendly chip to better perform AI tasks,Agencies,"Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has built an energy friendly chip that can perform powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tasks, enabling future mobile devices to implement ""neural networks"" modelled on the human brain . It is ten times as efficient as a mobile GPU (graphics processing unit) so it could enable mobile devices to run powerful AI algorithms locally rather than uploading data to the internet. Modern smartphones are equipped with advanced embedded chipsets. GPUs are an essential part of those chipsets and as mobile games are pushing the boundaries of their capabilities. Neural nets were widely studied in the early days of AI research, but by the 1970s, they had fallen out of favour. They have come back in the past decade under the name ""deep learning."" ""Deep learning is useful for many applications such as object recognition, speech and face detection,"" said Vivienne Sze, assistant professor at MIT. The new chip, which the researchers dubbed 'Eyeriss,' can also help usher in the 'Internet of things' ­ the idea that vehicles, appliances and civil-engineering structures, would have sensors that report information directly to networked servers, aiding with maintenance and task coordination. With powerful AI algorithms on board, networked devices could make important decisions locally. The MIT researchers used Eyeriss to implement a neural network that performs an image recognition task.

2016-01-29,"AI defeats humans at 2,500-year-old board game",PTI,"LONDON: For the first time, a Google computer programme has beaten a human champion of the 2,500-year-old complex Chinese game of Go, in an event seen as a milestone for artificial intelligence . Google DeepMind's AlphaGo beat the reigning three-time European Go champion Fan Hui - who has devoted his life to the game since the age of 12 - five games to nil in October last year in London. The first game mastered by a computer was noughts and crosses (also known as tic-tac-toe) in 1952. In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue computer famously beat Garry Kasparov at chess. But to date, Go has thwarted artificial intelligence (AI) researchers; computers still only play Go as well as amateurs. The game involves players taking turns to place black or white stones on a board, trying to capture the opponent's stones or surround empty space to make points of territory. However, as simple as the rules are, Go is a game of profound complexity. Invented in China over 2,500 years ago, Go is played by more than 40 million people worldwide. The number of possible positions in the games are more than the number of atoms in the universe. This complexity makes Go hard for computers to play, and therefore offers a challenge to AI researchers, who use games as a testing ground to invent smart, flexible algorithms that can tackle problems, sometimes in ways similar to humans. Traditional AI methods - which construct a search tree over all possible positions - do not have a chance in Go. ""So when we set out to crack Go, we took a different approach. We built a system, AlphaGo, that combines an advanced tree search with deep neural networks,"" Demis Hassabis, the chief executive of Google DeepMind wrote in a blog post. These neural networks take a description of the Go board as an input and process it through 12 different network layers containing millions of neuron-like connections. ""We trained the neural networks on 30 million moves from games played by human experts, until it could predict the human move 57 per cent of the time (the previous record before AlphaGo was 44 per cent),"" Hassabis said. ""But our goal is to beat the best human players, not just mimic them,"" he said. To do this, AlphaGo learned to discover new strategies for itself, by playing thousands of games between its neural networks, and adjusting the connections using a trial-and-error process known as reinforcement learning. ""After all that training it was time to put AlphaGo to the test. First, we held a tournament between AlphaGo and the other top programmes at the forefront of computer Go,"" said David Silver of Google DeepMind, the lead author of the study. AlphaGo won all but one of its 500 games against these programmes. The researchers then invited Hui for closed-doors match, where AlphaGo won by five games to nil. In March this year, AlphaGo will face a five-game challenge match in Seoul against the legendary Lee Sedol - the top Go player in the world over the past decade.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/ai-defeats-humans-at-2500-year-old-board-game/articleshow/50765368.cms
2015-12-25,"Chinese TV channel hires robot as reporter, anchors worried",PTI,"BEIJING: For the first time, a Chinese news channel has employed an artificial intelligence robot as a weather reporter on its live breakfast show, raising concerns among the country’s journalists as it could threaten their jobs. “I’m happy to start my new work on the winter solstice,” robot XiaoIce said during her debut on Tuesday morning. Xiao-Ice is actually a piece of software developed by Microsoft using smart cloud and big data. In the first two days of her work, XiaoIce impressed many with her cute voice. She also comments on big news events on Shanghai Dragon TV. According to Microsoft, breakthroughs in text-to-speech artificial intelligence (AI) have helped Xiao-Ice score high points for linguistic naturalness, with hers being closer to the human voice than other speech synthesisers. Through unique emotional technology, she can make comments instantly based on weather data. After her successful debut, people are worried that XiaoIce could cause traditional TV anchors and weather reporters to lose their jobs. Song Jiongming, director of TV news for the Shanghai Media Group, pointed out that human anchors will not be completely replaced by XiaoIce in the near term, but the robot will supplement humans with big data analysis capability. Robot reporters could easily replace a lot of Chinese reporters like this nationwide, a Chinese journalist said. “I’ve heard about robot reporters for a long time, but thought they only operated in the United States and Europe,” Li Wei said, adding that “I’m not ready to compete with them yet.” In September this year, Chinese social and gaming giant Tencent published its first business report written by a robot this, stroking fears among journalists. The “flawless” 916 -word article, completed in just one minute by Dream writer, was released via the company’s online portal.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/chinese-tv-channel-hires-robot-as-reporter-anchors-worried/articleshow/50318013.cms

2015-08-02,‘Students pursuing robotics have good job prospects’,Vaibhav Ganjapure,"Nagpur: Blockbuster ‘Robot’ starring superstar Rajinikant and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan had enthralled all with its lighting speed and acrobatics. Though it was just a movie, such robots are very much a possibility, perhaps as early as the next decade. Senior faculty from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology ( VNIT ) Pramod Padole and lecturer Shital Chiddarwar , experts in ‘Robotics’ field, believe that robots with artificial intelligence (AI), as shown in the movie are possible only due to robotics , a fast emerging field. AI is extensively used in the space technology. VNIT own students are already working on a robot which can be operated through a remote and perform small tasks like bringing milk packets or newspapers. With city taking a big leap in robotics education and research with the proposed ‘Oberoi centre for excellence’ at Nagpur University and Asea Brown Boveri’s (ABB) research centre at VNIT, robots with artificial intelligence can probably be manufactured in the city. In an interview with TOI, the two experts spoke at length on this fast-emerging but relatively unknown sector. Excerpts … Q. What is robotics all about? A. It’s a multidisciplinary field comprising three core branches of engineering – mechanical, electronics and computer science. Primarily, it’s a part of mechanical branch or, you can say, an extension of mechanisms. The actual body of a robot involves, mechanical engineering, making of its centralized circuit requires electronics engineering, while programming its movements needs computer science. Broadly, robotics is divided into — industrial and mobile. Q. What are possibilities of robots with artificial intelligence? A. Humanoid robots with artificial intelligence are very much possible. At VNIT we’re trying to such robots which can replicate our movements by recognizing our faces and gestures. Our students have created snake robots and a unique one called ‘Butler Bot' which is fitted with a camera and an arm. It could be operated from a laptop, Wi-Fi and even Bluetooth, and can bring a pen from other rooms on your instructions. It’s surely of the help of old persons, who find it difficult to move and also useful in hotels. We’re yet to file any patent, as we want to further improve its working and make it all-terrain robot. Q. What kind of students could pursue this field? A. Basically, they need an engineering degree in mechanical, electronics or computer science, as these three majorly contributes to it. Those from other background would find it tough to learn the subject. However, only those having good grasp over mathematics can excel in robotics, as they need to do thousands of calculations to reach accuracy. Q. How robotics applications are used in industrial products? A. In several ways. Our students have developed an application for spray painting that can ensure uniform thickness. It can also be used in assembly operation in manufacturing units. The robotics applications can be effectively used in hazardous and repetitive work where there is a threat to humans. Q. What about job prospects? A. Very promising and students can land job even in city. Manufacturing units recruit students with specialization in robotics. Such students are in huge demand all over. Robots are increasingly being used for performing complicated medical surgeries sciences. But many students from VNIT prefer to complete their post graduation from abroad where they can land decent jobs with multinational automobile makers. They are also in demand in research and automation fields. Q. Has VNIT been working in this field since a long time? A. The first robotics group was constituted in 1995 after which small robots are procured for studies. But the actual work began 2012 where we bought new equipment and also procured a new robot from ABB for research lab. About 25-30 BTech students are studying this elective subject while 5-10 MTech students have opted for it. A couple of students have made it as topic for their PhD. We’re working on several research projects related to the field, including that of CAD/CAM. In last three years, we’ve filed two patents and presented several papers. Our students run an ‘innovation lab’ at Mechanical Department which is being funded by the VNIT alumni and is open for all. Q. What courses are you planning in the new robotics centre? A. We’re soon inking a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with ABB where postgraduate courses like MTech would be offered. We will ask ABB, which has a vast expertise and experience in this field, to allow our students and faculties to work on live projects. We will also like to work on big industrial projects through this research centre. We will approach companies for their projects that will be completed at the centre. Q. How many colleges in the country offer specialized courses in robotics? A. Perhaps not a single one. All robotics programmes are offered in combination with other subjects like CAD/CAM. IITs and Indian Institute of Science are pioneers in this field in the country. Q. Why has India lagged behind? A. It’s still at nascent stage and requires huge push from the school and college levels to actually get awareness. It’s a technology of future, but funding is a real problem in our country. The countries like the US and Japan are at forefront in using this technology due to their small population and shortage of manpower. But here, there is excess manpower. We are funded by Department of Science and technology (DST), but this area needs lot of funds for research activities. Q. What is the difference between the robotics centres in NU and VNIT? A. At VNIT, research on application of robotics will be carried out. This will be only for MTech and PhD students. At the NU centre, students can pursue various diploma courses in robotics. On completion, they can pursed advanced studies at VNIT. The NU centre will act like a stepping stone for students to do higher studies or research in VNIT.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/students-pursuing-robotics-have-good-job-prospects/articleshow/48312229.cms
2015-07-29,Tech experts warn against 'AI arms race',Kounteya Sinha,"LONDON: Over a 1,000 stalwarts from the world of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) including icons like Stephen Hawking, technologist Elon Musk, philosopher Noam Chomsky and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak have signed a letter calling for a blanket ban on killer robots . “We believe that AI has great potential to benefit humanity in many ways, and that the goal of the field should be to do so. Starting a military AI arms race is a bad idea, and should be prevented by a ban on offensive autonomous weapons beyond meaningful human control,“ the letter says. According to the experts, killer robots select and engage targets without human intervention. They might include, for example, armed quadcopters that can search for and eliminate people meeting certain predefined criteria, but do not include cruise missiles or remotely piloted drones for which humans make all targeting decisions. They say that AI technology has reached a point where the deployment of such systems is -practically if not legally -feasible within years, not decades, and the stakes are high -autonomous weapons have been described as the third revolution in warfare, after gunpowder and nuclear arms. It adds: “The key question for humanity today is whether to start a global AI arms race or to prevent it from starting. If any major military power pushes ahead with AI weapon development, a global arms race is virtually inevitable, and the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious: autonomous weapons will become the Kalashnikovs of tomorrow.“",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/tech-experts-warn-against-ai-arms-race/articleshow/48260506.cms
2014-11-03,Wipro to set up digital pods to push automation,Shilpa Phadnis,"BANGALORE: Wipro ’s new initiatives in automation and artificial intelligence will involve establishment of what it calls digital pods. And there will be four of them — one each Bangalore, London, in the San Francisco Bay Area, and another elsewhere in Asia. The digital pod will be like an innovation lab with giant digital screens simulating applications in a live-use case scenario. The four pods are part of India’s third-largest IT company’s newly-carved division Wipro Digital that offers customers digital capabilities through strategy, design and technology. “The idea behind a digital pod is that we can sit together with our customers and demonstrate to them what can be achieved by throwing in some artificial intelligence tools into their business processes. In many cases, we would also be working with them to fine-tune the tools to make the processes more automated and efficient,” Wipro CEO T K Kurien said. He added it would be possible to simulate the end-to-end experience on the interactive screen. Currently, the digital pod in Bangalore has 35 people and employs a mix of strategists, creative directors, digital marketers and designers. Kurien said the pod would reduce the development cycle time significantly, so that customers can go to market in a short time. Wipro focuses on the execution of digital transformation agendas at scale, starting from the customer touch point to the entire back-office process. Most large IT and technology firms are carving out separate digital units, deploying automation and artificial intelligence tools. Accenture recently launched the Accenture Digital Services. “Wipro’s big focus is investing in open-source computing, digital transformation services, artificial intelligence and advanced technologies consulting and managed services. There is direct interest from the CEO downwards (for cognitive computing and automation) and have specific investments in this space, but they have been shy to launch anything officially,” said Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based research and consultancy firm HfS Research, who has been following the company closely.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/wipro-to-set-up-digital-pods-to-push-automation/articleshow/45017463.cms
2014-08-20,IITians develop robot capable of climbing stairs,Abhinav Malhotra,"KANPUR: A team of four BTech students were successful in developing a robot named 'Transformer', capable of changing its height. This is the most unique feature of the robot. It can perform a number of tasks, which other robots cannot. Another uniqueness of it is that the chassis has been made of ply coated with fibre glass for making it light and durable. It can climb stairs, which normally other robots are not able to do. The four students involved in the project are Ayush Poddar, Yogesh Kumar, Harshit Lathi and Anirban Manna. The robot can change its orientation according to environment such as traversing through narrow passage, crawling on a rough surface and climbing a slope. Ayush said that the project was completed during the summer camp this year. ""The robot can crawl if needed. In future, it can be developed further. More algorithms can be fed and its functions can be increased,"" he said. The team was planning to install sensors on ‘Transformer’ so that it becomes more automatic and plan its actions. ""Installation of sensors will provide artificial intelligence. The team will work on it in the next stage. For the first time, ply coated with fibre glass was used for making chassis of the robot. The robot has four legs and each leg consists of four servos and one DC motor. Each leg has four degrees of freedom, making it capable of transforming. The robot is controlled via Arduino Mega (CPU) and it is driven by using a bluetooth module. It can also lift load and carry it to the designated place. The camera installed on it can help to see the visuals around it. The robot can be used for spying. It can be used on different terrain like desert and jungle.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/iitians-develop-robot-capable-of-climbing-stairs/articleshow/40435670.cms
2014-05-26,CERN offers prizes to develop algorithms to study Higgs boson,PTI,"LONDON: Researchers at CERN , and several other organizations, are offering cash prizes to citizen scientists who can develop machine-learning techniques to improve analysis of Higgs boson data . The Higgs boson machine learning challenge will reward the winners with up to $7,000 in cash. The discovery of the Higgs boson, which is responsible for giving all particles their mass, was confirmed on July 4, 2012. But for physicists, the discovery of a new particle is just the beginning of a long and difficult quest to meticulously measure its characteristics and determine if it fits their model of matter, said CERN, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, in a statement. A key property of any particle is how often it decays into other particles. The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN searches for new particles and processes using head-on collisions of protons of extraordinarily high energy. The ATLAS experiment has recently observed a signal of the Higgs boson decaying into two tau particles, but this decay is a small signal buried in background noise. The goal of the Higgs boson machine-learning challenge is to explore the potential of advanced machine-learning methods to improve the analysis of data produced by the experiment. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence in which computers are trained to recognise patterns in data. The machines learn to recognise elements of data sets and can then apply this to new, unseen data. For the challenge, no knowledge of particle physics is required. Using simulated data with features characterising events detected by ATLAS, the task is to classify events into ""tau tau decay of a Higgs boson"" versus ""background."" The contest will end in September and successful participants will receive cash prizes. The first place prize is $7,000, second place is $4,000, and third place is $2,000, according to wired.com. The winning method may eventually be applied to real data and the winners may be invited to CERN to discuss their results with high-energy physicists. Organizations involved in the challenge include Google, The Center for Data Science of Paris-Saclay, and INRIA, a French research institute of computer science, among others.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/cern-offers-prizes-to-develop-algorithms-to-study-higgs-boson/articleshow/35613501.cms
2014-03-08,Movie robots are not about robotics: Expert,Subhro Niyogi,"KOLKATA: Robots at home may sound fantastic but what if someone told you that most middle-class homes in Kolkata already have these intelligent machines that can perform tasks? ""Washing machines and dish washers are robots as they are equipped with sensors and programmed with artificial intelligence and they perform household chores,"" said robotics expert James McLurkin, debunking the common perception of humanoids perpetuated by Hollywood movies like 'Terminator'. The research scientist at iRobot and assistant professor at Rice University, US, who built his first robot Rover in 1988 when he was a teenager and quickly followed it with many other designs such as LEGO bricks, said unlike the fantastic robots in movies that left viewers spell-bound and even terrified by the possibility of the machines taking over man, robots in reality are machines that can carry out tasks that are dangerous, dirty and dull. While washing machines and intelligent vacuum cleaners do the dull and dirty tasks, machines used to snoop into caves like the US army did in Afghanistan or by security personnel to check and defuse bombs perform tasks that outright dangerous. ""Movie robots are not quite about robotics as they are about animatronics and mechatronics. I enjoy seeing them as well but that is it. It is unlikely that robots will ever become exterminators,"" said McLurkin who was recognized by 'Time' magazine as one of America's top-five engineers in the 'Rise of the Machines' feature and by 'Black Enterprise' magazine as the Best and Brightest Under 40. He is in the city to interact with students ranging from those in junior school to those at IIT Kharagpur. Using nature as a model, McLurkin's core research has centered on developing distributed algorithms for multi-robot systems which is the software that produces complex group behaviors from the interactions of many simple individuals. ""These ideas are not new: ants, bees, wasps, and termites have been running this type of software for 120 million years. If we can use a large number of robots that can communicate and coordinate with each other to perform a task, they can be deployed in numbers to fight forest fire, explore in vast areas like the sea, fight in battlefields and even bring shelves to customers instead of the other way round in departmental store,"" he said. McLurkin believes we are at a point where we are barely becoming comfortable with robots and expects them to emerge from factories, farms and research laboratories in the years ahead to become mainstream. ""I see self-driving cars and more applications in healthcare. While robotics is used in laparoscopic surgery, they will be used in more surgeries and rehabilitation. Robots in conjunction with humans can do much better, particularly in physical therapy. While doctors will diagnose and prescribe therapy, robots will take over the task of monitoring and recording the therapy. Also, expect robots to be on the forefront of entertainment,"" he said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/movie-robots-are-not-about-robotics-expert/articleshow/31634150.cms
2013-12-09,'Artificial intelligence is the future',Parth Shastri,"AHMEDABAD: He is just 25 but has already two successful companies to his credit. Besides being the recipient of numerous national and international awards, Nirmit Parikh has been instrumental in bringing Intel 's first office in the state in Ahmedabad. Now shuttling between US and India, he dreams of making Ahmedabad the new Silicon Valley of India. Nirmit has just launched UnMuted, a smart phone-based application for giving voice to the citizens to solve civic issues. He talks about the future of mankind intertwined with technology and innovation in Gujarat. His tryst with entrepreneurship started in 2009 when he set up Incone Technologies, an artificial intelligence (AI) based flood management system at dams with hydropower projects. The successful venture has clientele in both India and abroad including Gujarat's Sardar Sarovar dam project. His second project was Cruxbot where he pioneered web-based summarization tools through CruxLight technology. The AI-based project that imitates brain's neural network to make complex connections was much-talked about and appreciated after which it was acquired by US-based edutech firm Kno.com in March this year. Kno.com in turn was acquired by Intel in November and Nirmit became young director of the company. As a byproduct, the city also got Intel office. Today CruxLight is available as free add-on with most of the internet browsers. ""AI is everywhere - from IBM 's supercomputer Watson to self-driving cars that promise accident-free drives. Emerging power of machines is critical primary stage for next generation of computer and robotics. Alan Turing , the computer visionary, had predicted the AI where machines would imitate human cognitive process. I guess we are witnessing it happen right now in projects like Amazon's drone delivery system,"" he says. When questioned about the environment for innovation and emergence of technology in India, Nirmit says that today it is not enough to equip engineering students with only technical skills. ""They must acquire knowledge in interdisciplinary terms - how to iterate designs rapidly, how to manufacture sustainably, how to address global market while fusing art and science. Today ever-hungry students however have option to go out of age-old mould and explore options like MOOCs (Massive open online courses) like Coursera, Udacity, Edx, etc,"" he says. He also talks about need-based innovations that solve problems of the world. ""We have seen innovations like Facebook and Pinterest but the new generation of researchers is finding innovative ways to harness power of technology from finding lost children in Africa to use smart phones to fight corruption. The technological capacity has outwitted our knowledge how to use and thus we are trying to find new ways to correlate social change and innovations,"" says Nirmit. He does not forget the 'small screen.' His UnMuted in collaboration with World Economic Forum 's Global Shapers Community tries to address the issue of reporting civic issues and seeking its answers with use of smart phones. ""With rising mobile landscape and hundreds of usages, mobile phones have made it possible to have contextual experience with location and sensor-based services never possible on desktops. With innovations like Google Glass, the world will again shrink for users,"" he says. His most important lessons come from the ventures he dreamed of floating. He remembers how once he was asked to send 'somebody up in the hierarchy' to seal the deal. ""All of today's multi-billion Internet companies have been startups by young. Our social fabric in India has still not encouraged the young enough. Hopefully it will change soon,"" says Nirmit.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/artificial-intelligence-is-the-future/articleshow/27099968.cms
2013-10-07,Terminator-like cube robots can self-assemble,PTI,"WASHINGTON: Scientists have developed new Terminator-style cube-shaped robots that can leap through the air, jump on top of each other and assemble together to form arbitrary shapes. A more refined version of the robots could temporarily repair bridges or buildings during emergencies, or assemble into different types of furniture or heavy equipment as needed, researchers say. Developed by scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the robots, known as M-Blocks , are cubes with no external moving parts. They are able to climb over and around one another, roll across the ground, and even move while suspended upside down from metallic surfaces, researchers said. Inside each robot is a flywheel that can reach speeds of 20,000 revolutions per minute; when the flywheel is braked, it imparts its angular momentum to the cube. On each edge of an M-Block , and on every face, are cleverly arranged permanent magnets that allow any two cubes to attach to each other. “It’s one of these things that the (modular-robotics ) community has been trying to do for a long time,” said Daniela Rus, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science and director of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory ( CSAIL ). “We just needed a creative insight and somebody who was passionate enough to keep coming at it — despite being discouraged,” she said. As with any modular-robot system, the hope is that the modules can be miniaturized— the ultimate aim of most such research is hordes of swarming ‘microbots’ that can self-assemble , like the “liquid steel” androids in the movie ‘Terminator II’ . MIT researchers are now building an army of 100 cubes, each of which can move in any direction, and designing algorithms to guide them. “We want hundreds of cubes, scattered randomly across the floor, to be able to identify each other, coalesce, and autonomously transform into a chair, or a ladder, or a desk, on demand ,” said John Romanishin of CSAIL.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/terminator-like-cube-robots-can-self-assemble/articleshow/23622268.cms
2013-04-30,Infosys partners with IPsoft for automation,Sujit John,"BANGALORE: In a move that signals a significant step towards automation in the IT services outsourcing business, Infosys has struck a partnership with IPsoft, the New York-based company founded by Indian American Chetan Dube that provides tools that free engineers from mundane, repetitive tasks. The most fascinating and influential aspect of IPsoft’s technology is that it includes the element of machine learning — or artificial intelligence as some call it — so that companies don’t have to employ an army of people to write the complicated scripts that traditional automation tools require. The system learns from doing, thus making the process of automation itself automated. These elements have helped build 220 customers for IPsoft worldwide, including Cisco, Canon, Pepsico, British Telecom, Gap, ING, Autodesk and Pfizer. Infosys will use the technology to automate parts of its infrastructure management and network management services — the areas that IPsoft’s platform is particularly strong in. It will also work with IPsoft to adapt the technology to application maintenance and business process outsourcing services and, over time, look at adapting it to automate even parts of its application development business. “What robotics did for the auto assembly line, we are now doing for the IT engineering line,” said Chandrashekar Kakal , global head of Infosys’s business IT services, the segment that constituted 63% of the company’s $7.4-billion revenues last year. He said customers to whom the technology had been demonstrated were excited. Kakal will establish a centre of excellence at Infosys’s Mysore campus to do R&D, establish proofs of concepts and train engineers on IPsoft’s platform. Initially, some 200 employees will be trained a. Speaking to TOI on the phone from New York, Chetan Dube too referred to the automotive example and said, “History repeats itself.” He said the IT industry was on the precipice of a transformation unlike any before. He said complexities in networks and applications had grown so much that traditional systems were unable to handle them. “Chief information officers are under increasing pressure from business units to ensure availability of IT resources, and ensure consistency of business outcomes, without any variance. Human processes have variance built into their DNA. Our automated systems ensure absolute consistency, and are selfhealing and self-governing ,” he said. He said IPsoft was in talks with some of the other leading Indian IT companies for similar partnerships but declined to name them. However, indications are that the others include Wipro and Cognizant. Automation possibilities are very high — up to 80-90 % — in what are called Level 0 and Level 1 tasks, like password resets , database failures. If a database goes down because it’s full, the manual process would involve a human being expanding the capacity or purging some data to create space. IPsoft’s platform will automatically do these tasks, it will also figure out why the failure happened, and prevent future failures by, say, automatically purging data that it understands to be least relevant.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/infosys-partners-with-ipsoft-for-automation/articleshow/19793835.cms
2013-01-17,"Now, a robot nurse to monitor ICU patients",Pushpa Narayan,"CHENNAI: In the quite intensive care unit of Sri Ramachandra University , a sleek robot named Chitti will soon pull up by the bedside, observe patients and run some tests. In case of an emergency, Chitti would send a message to a doctor. Doctors can connect with their patient through a videoconferencing facility built within the robot, from any part of the world. Chitti - the name superstar Rajinikanth gave to his robot character in the movie 'Enthiran' - will help doctors at Ramachandra do this. ""It's an amazing device that can be programmed to monitor any number of patients,"" says Dr K Selvakumar, head of neurosurgery, who also chairs the telemedicine department in the hospital. The robot, which helps overcome manpower shortage, is also patient friendly. Using robots in healthcare is not new. Doctors have used robotic arms to do surgeries of the heart, bones and to remove cancerous tumours. Now, doctors across the world prefer mobile robots that work as the eyes, ears and voices of healthcare workers. ""It does not replace a doctor or a nurse. But it allows healthcare workers to communicate more easily even when they aren't at work,"" says Dr Selvakumar. Former President A P J Abdul Kalam will formally switch on Chitti on Saturday. Many hospitals abroad use mobile robots to do menial jobs such as guiding patients and visitors to various places, carrying data, and documents of samples from bedside to labs for testing. Though most of these robots called tele-robots are just mechanical devices, research is on to make ones with better artificial intelligence to do things like giving a CPR in case of a patient suffering heart failure. Many surgeons in Chennai use robotic arms to assist them in surgeries of the heart, abdomen and bones. One of the latest streams where specialists are finding robots more efficient is in cancer surgeries. Doctors say such surgeries are precise as they offer 3D high definition vision, enhanced dexterity and accuracy along with comfort to surgeons, who are seated a few metres away from the patient. Apollo Hospitals will launch an 'OncoRobotic Surgery' initiative to commemorate World Cancer Day on February 4. The hospital has invited Korean surgeons Dr Woong Youn Chung of Yonsei University School of medicine, Seoul, Korea and Dr Byung Soh Min of Yonsei University, Seoul, who would conduct workshops and perform onco-robotic surgeries along with a team of Apollo Hospitals surgeons on 25 patients. The team will operate urologic, gynaecologic, colo-rectal and head-and-neck cancers during this period, said robotic surgeon Dr Venkatasalam. After initial difficulty, surgeons have now been able to convince patients to undergo robotic surgery, but doctors are not sure about the mobile robotic nurses because of the impersonal feel. ""It may take a while for patients to get used to them,"" said Dr Venkatasalam.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/now-a-robot-nurse-to-monitor-icu-patients/articleshow/18054969.cms

The robot can fly in a cluttered environment and if a sudden collision with an obstacle happens, it will resume its original position and can also control its speed like an insect. According to the inventors, it is still under development and can be used for rescue operations during earthquakes. It currently has sensors for detecting light, and can be modified to have gas sensors too. It can be used in hostage situations too with certain modifications, claim the innovators. 2)SOINN-based HIRO robot from Tokyo: This robot can think, learn and act by itself using artificial intelligence. This robot remembers basic knowledge and it can apply that knowledge to its immediate situation. The technology also allows the robot to connect to the internet and other robots for information. 3)NAO robot: It is capable of expressing anger, fear, sadness, happiness, excitement and pride. The robot, an invention from France, is currently performing on the Gangnam style at the campus for the visitors. The robot is capable of dispalying any emotions. 4)Xachikoma robot: Also from France, is an SUV-sized mobile robot from France. The design is largely inspired by jumping spiders and they are quick on roads as well as on uneven terrains. The robot can dance and even write if it is given a pen. It can also change its direction if it meets an obstacle. 5)NETRA, created in MIT's Media Lab, is a device that attaches itself onto cell phones in order to diagnose eye power in developing countries. It can be fixed in your cell phone and is compact and portable too and cost effective. Techfest also saw the presence of around six eminent personalities. Jocelyn Goldfein, director of engineering, Facebook, who was present, spoke on the evolution of news feed. She spoke at length about how Facebook will not be afraid to try out new features even when they are running a successful product. ""Newsfeed is the emotional core of Facebook and means different things to different people. It is the single most popular website feature that has existed. It takes a certain hubris or arrogance to contemplate changing that,"" she said at the lecture. She added that the only thing constant at Facebook is change and it will change again. ""We are not afraid of trying something new even when we are enjoying a terrific product,"" she added. She reinforced that changes in Facebook are based on the Zukerberg's Law which states ""that people will share twice as much information as they shared this year and next year, they will be sharing twice as much as they did the year before..."" ""In developing news feed, three fundamental tensions have to be negotiated-determinism v/s magic, freshness v/s staleness and consumption v/s interaction,"" said Goldfein.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/robot-power-steals-the-show-at-techfest/articleshow/17878365.cms
2012-12-29,"Soon, a robot helper to do daily chores at home",PTI,"LONDON: Scientists are designing a new ambitious robotic humanoid helper with artificial muscles to help people with everyday tasks. Engineers at the University of Zurich 's Artificial Intelligence Lab hope that 1.2 metre tall Roboy, designed to look like a child, will help the sick and elderly by acting as a mechanical helper. The research team is developing radical artificial 'tendons' to help the robot move, the 'Daily Mail' reported. They have already signed up 15 project partners and over 40 engineers, and hope to fund the project using a combination of commercial partners and crowd-funding. Researchers hope Roboy will become a blueprint for 'service robots ' that work alongside humans. ""Service robots are machines that are, to a certain extent, able to execute services independently for the convenience of human beings. Since they share their 'living space' with people, user-friendliness and safety are of great importance,"" researchers said. The project will use artificial tendons to develop Roboy within nine months. Roboy will be unveiled in March 2013 at the Robots on Tour event in Zurich.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/soon-a-robot-helper-to-do-daily-chores-at-home/articleshow/17802784.cms
2012-09-20,This robot can work with us in factories,PTI,"LONDON: A humanoid robot with 'common sense', designed to work safely alongside its human co-workers on factory production lines, has been unveiled in the US. Baxter, the robot is priced at $22,000 and will go on sale in October. It could apply common sense, adapt to its environment and be trained in less than 30 minutes to complete specific tasks, by workers without robotic expertise, its makers say . Currently factory robots tend to work separately to humans, often in cages, the ' BBC News ' reported. Rodney Brooks, Rethink Robotics founder and former director of the MIT Computer and Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, said that Baxter represented a ""new concept in manufacturing"". ""Roboticists have been successful in designing robots capable of superhuman speed,"" he said. ""What's proven difficult is inventing robots that can act as we do - in other words, that are able to inherently understand and adapt to their environment,"" he said. To teach Baxter a job, a human guides its arms to simulate the task, and presses a button to programme in the pattern, the report said.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/this-robot-can-work-with-us-in-factories/articleshow/16470224.cms
2012-04-29,Future of war: flying robots that can spy and kill too,Manmohan Bahadur,"Imagine being at the receiving end of a missile that is targeting ‘bad guys’ lazing in the sun in the AfPak region, or a ride in a vehicle in Yemen ending in annihilation, courtesy a missile from a Predator drone. It sounds like retribution from the heavens, except that it is a purely human endeavour. The west is determinedly moving towards this type of warfare built around, what the Americans call, remote split operations. It’s in our interest that we assimilate the implications of this trend in war fighting, which looks like the use of the mythical weapon Vajra by Indra. Remote split operations are unique — an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) could be flying anywhere in the globe while being controlled by a pilot sitting in an air-conditioned room in America. After assuming controls of the UAV, he could be firing a missile to kill a terrorist as part of his task for the day. Once his shift ends, the UAV pilot would return home and maybe, take his family out for dinner! This is not science fiction but an act being played out daily. ‘UAV' is a household word; the Americans fielded 5000 UAVs of all types in Iraq and Afghanistan (up from 200 in the 1991 Gulf War). And the plans are grandiose. US Air Force’s vision document ‘Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) flight plan 2009-2047 ’ charges it ‘to harness increasingly automated, modular, globally connected and sustainable multi-mission unmanned systems resulting in a leaner more adaptable and efficient air force.’ The attributes of persistence, endurance, efficiency and connectivity , which are inherent in a drone and are potent force multipliers, will be used to overcome human limitations and revolutionize war fighting. The UAS developmental plan involves harnessing net centricity that the West has perfected, and having unmanned aircraft available worldwide, ready to be directed to a conflict zone by pilots sitting at home bases. With evolutionary progress in harnessing artificial intelligence, the UASs would be infused with the power to take combat decisions. They would engage in combat to support other manned aircraft or carry weapons to increase fire power availability. The final step would be the use of this technological asymmetry to put the adversary off-balance and, as the UAS flight plan document says, bring about a “… revolution in the roles of humans in air warfare.” Where does that place the notion of sovereignty of a state? In Libya last year, Security Council Resolution 1973 mandated protection of civilians, “… while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form…” — implying no foreign troops on ground. However, Apache helicopters fired their missiles from not more than five to eight km from Muammar Gaddafi’s troops. Does it imply that, just because they were not actually touching the ground, the sanctity of the UN mandate was upheld? And say, the same scenario repeats itself two decades from now — would the utilization, then, of UASs with offensive capabilities not be in violation of a non-interference resolution of the Security Council a la the Libyan UNSCR 1973, just because there would be no humans on board? Possibly , a ‘human’ would need to be redefined! High casualty sensitivity in the western society is driving the robotisation of machines of war. Besides UAS, we would have unmanned ground vehicles capable of kinetic actions on the battlefield. This robotisation has brought in questions of the moral and ethical kind, as such asymmetry in technological progress, where one's own troops are absolutely safe while engaged in mortal combat, would bring in arrogance of power. The asymmetry would be a critical handicap for the less technologically endowed states, making them vulnerable to unilateralism and violation of their sovereignty. While India is no pushover, it is imperative that one acknowledges the existence and repercussions of this asymmetry and works to a plan which would demand accelerated indigenous military technological research and development and close integration of all elements of national power, especially diplomatic and economic.

2012-01-02,Bangalore integrates 250 robots every year,TNN,"BANGALORE: We don’t know if life will turn out like in the Will Smith starrer, I,Robot, where robots even think and emote on their own, but certainly we’re on the way to robots doing a good deal of work for us. This is already happening at our doorstep – Bangalore is not only churning out 250 robots every year for the city and rest of the country, top companies here are deploying industrial robots to make cars, buses and other heavy vehicles apart from electronic gadgets. Already good at IT services, how good is Bangalore in robotics? Ajay Gopalswamy , CEO of Difacto Robotics and Automation, one of the few robotics companies in Bangalore, explains that robotics is doing fairly well in the city. “Bangalore is a top centre when it comes to robot integration and distribution. Around six companies do the integration work in Bangalore,” he says. “Bangalore is home to three top robot importers – Fanuc, ABB and Yaskawa __and the headquarters of the first two are right here. The city integrates robots imported by these companies. While we haven’t yet acquired expertise in manufacturing the robots ourselves, things are set to change from next year. A private company is focused on manufacture and we should be seeing an indigenous robot coming out of Bangalore mid -2012,” says Gopalswamy. Bangalore has an academic profile too in robotics. Prof Ashitava Ghosal of IISc puts it in perspective: “Every year 25 to 30 students choose the course. It is an inter-disciplinary subject and we invite students from electrical, electronics, computer science and mechanical engineering. VTU and many colleges in the city offer industrial robotics as an elective. There is no degree in robotics, but people specialize in robotics and acquire a mechanical engineering PhD.’’ Then there is significant research and application work being undertaken by the DRDO lab, Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ( CAIR ). “CAIR has developed and provided a number of technological solutions/products for the civilian sector like its system for the automatic processing of handwritten application forms, intelligent wheelchair for the physically challenged and laparoscopic surgery trainer,” says a DRDO official. On the medical front too robots have come into Bangalore. Many hospitals offer robotic surgeries for cancer and other serious ailments.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bangalore-integrates-250-robots-every-year/articleshow/11333293.cms
2011-11-25,Now hands-on lessons on robotics,,"MANGALORE: Engineering students in ‘Namma Bengaluru’ and ‘Amgele Kudla’, who are looking out to iron out the creases in niche engineering areas like robotics, computer science and artificial intelligence (AI), can now look forward to the Center for Robotics and Embedded Systems Excellence ( CRESE ). A tie up of iCarnegie of Carnegie Mellon University , USA, global leaders in above areas, with Technophilia Systems Pvt Ltd has seen the launch of CRESE. Reva Institute of Technology and Management, and BNM Institute of Technology, Bangalore and St Joseph Engineering College, Mangalore are among the 25 engineering institutes across India that have signed up for CRESE. Indian engineering students through CRESE will get practical exposure that matches international standards. This is phase I of the launch of CRESE for Indian engineering universities and colleges. CRESE was launched identifying core need to offer practical trials that supplements theoretical approach, with the objective to offer live experiments, real time projects, extensive research and training in the above said areas of engineering. This would give students a glimpse of real life challenges that engineers face in the industry when an idea is implemented to an application. Set up as a training and research lab across Indian universities in CRESE, students will get an exposure on taking up unique projects based on latest robotic applications rarely seen in India. Some of the projects to be developed by students and that could benefit Indian core sectors are: Rubik's cube solving robot - a robotic system which can solve Rubik's Cube in less than two minutes. Plans have made for an exo-skeleton robot or a robotic suit which can be worn by a human for lifting extremely heavy weights which they cannot usually lift, haptic science based robots , a robot which follows human body movements, satellite-GPS controlled robot - arobot which can be controlled from anywhere in the world using GPS satellite and a robots that can be controlled by speech commands. The association aims at tying up with 75 more institutions to complete its target of reaching 100 CRESE partner colleges by July 2012. CRESE is designed by the research engineers at Technophilia and certified by iCarnegie and powered by Carnegie Mellon experts to ensure course effectiveness and quality standards for Indian students. CRESE, according to its promoters, will instigate the concept of research driven engineering education that is popular in foreign varsities.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/now-hands-on-lessons-on-robotics/articleshow/10863997.cms
2011-01-05,AI may soon become reality: Penrose,Prithvijit Mitra,"KOLKATA: It is possible that computers of the future will not merely carry out instructions but act on their own, taking logical decisions based on reason and guided by situations which has so far been the preserve of humans. They will compute, assess and act discerningly without interference to a large extent. While this may sound a bit like science fiction, computers could soon reach such a stage, predicted legendary mathematical physicist Roger Penrose, now in the city to attend science meets. While there was still ""quite a long way to go"" before that stage is reached, significant steps have been taken towards the goal, added Penrose. ""There are many things in physics which are yet unknown. Unless we unravel them, we can't think of creating real artificial intelligence. It can't be achieved through the present system of computing which is based on mathematical algorithm. We need to be able to replicate human consciousness which, I believe, is possible through physics. It could be done by exploring the bordering areas of classical physics and quantum mechanics. The good news is that recent experiments indicate that it's possible,"" explained Penrose, an Emeritus Rouse Ball professor of mathematics at the Mathematical Institute , University of Oxford . Winner of several awards, including the Wolf Prize for physics in 1988, the 79-year-old mathematician stressed that the known laws of physics can't replicate consciousness. Penrose delivered the second Rabindranath Tagore lecture at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics on Tuesday. His argument, which Penrose had put forward in his controversial book ""The Emperor's New Mind"", has been countered by physicists. But Penrose has maintained that ""a system can be deterministic without being algorithmic"". He has even used the Turing's halting theorem to demonstrate that it is possible to replicate consciousness. ""I am not saying that it's easy. To begin with, we don't have a theory for this and a lot of things, as I mentioned, remain unknown. But we are fast reaching a stage from where we can take a shot at it,"" predicted Penrose. He calls it the ""correct quantum gravity"", which argues that the rational processes of the mind are completely algorithmic and can be duplicated by a sufficiently complex computing system. In his lecture, the stalwart spoke about the inter-relations of truth, beauty and morality and how they could be co-related in science. He also spoke at length on the geometric interpretations of time and space. Penrose dwelled on his theory of cyclic conformal cosmology as well, which seeks to establish that the universe existed before the Big Bang. ""It is likely to have existed in some form. It could continue to survive even after the present universe ceases to exist. This is a cyclic process,"" he said. Switching back to his views on artificial intelligence (AI), the veteran researcher said it could lead to an ethical dilemma. ""A few years back, scientists at Nasa had contemplated sending intelligent robots to space and sought my inputs. Even though we are still unable to create some device with genuine feelings and understanding, the question remains a disturbing one. Is it ethical to leave a machine which has consciousness in some faraway planet or in space? Honestly, we haven't reached that stage yet. Having said that, I must add that it may not be too far away, either. It is certainly a possibility.""",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ai-may-soon-become-reality-penrose/articleshow/7219700.cms

2009-07-06,"Now, a robot rat unveiled!",PTI,"LONDON: British scientists have developed a robot rat which they claim can seek out and identify objects using its whiskers. A team from the Bristol Robotics Laboratory and the University of Sheffield has unveiled the 'SCRATCHbot' robot as part of a project to develop biologically inspired artificial intelligence systems. According to the scientists, the robot will help in understanding how the human brain controls the movement of the sensory systems and this technology relies on sophisticated touch technology, enabling the robot to function in spaces such as smoke-filled rooms, where vision cannot be used. The new technology has the potential for a number of further applications from using robots underground, under the sea, or in extremely dusty conditions, where vision is often seriously compromised, they said. The new technology has been inspired by the use of touch in the animal kingdom. In nocturnal creatures, or those that inhabit poorly-lit places, this physical sense is widely preferred to vision as a primary means of discovering world. Rats are especially effective at exploring their environments using their whiskers. They are able to accurately determine the position, shape and texture of objects using precise rhythmic sweeping movements of their whiskers, make rapid accurate decisions about objects, and then use the information to build environmental maps, the scientists said. Team member Dr Tony Pipe said: ""For a long time, vision has been the biological sensory modality most studied by scientists. But active touch sensing is a key focus for those of us looking at biological systems which have implications for robotics research. ""Sensory systems such as rats' whiskers have some particular advantages in this area. In humans, for example, where sensors are at the fingertips, they are more vulnerable to damage and injury than whiskers."" According to the scientists, rats have the ability to operate with damaged whiskers and in theory broken whiskers on robots could be easily replaced, without affecting the whole robot and its expensive engineering. ""Future applications for this technology could include using robots underground, under the sea, or in extremely dusty conditions, where vision is often a seriously compromised sensory modality. Here, whisker technology could be used to sense objects and manoeuvre in a difficult environment. ""In a smoke filled room for example, a robot like this could help with a rescue operation by locating survivors of a fire.

A team of researchers led by Christopher MacLeod at the Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, UK, created the robot that adapts to such changes by mimicking biological evolution. Macleod's robot's software ""brain"" assigns new clusters of ""neurons"" to adapt to new additions to its body, according to a report in the New Scientist magazine. The artificial intelligence engineer said the team ran tests in which the whole ""brain"" was able to re-evolve, but the system became too complex and simply grounded to a halt. The scientist is now taking his idea a step further, with a simulated robot that not only evolves its own way of moving, but also decides how many legs and sensors it needs to carry out a given task most effectively, the report said. The humanoid is controlled by a neural network - software that mimics the brain's learning process. This comprises a set of interconnected processing nodes which can be trained to produce desired actions, the report said. MacLeod's team took this idea a step further and developed an incremental evolutionary algorithm (IEA) capable of adding new parts to its robot brain over time. The robot can also adapt to newly acquired vision, and learn how to avoid or seek light when given a camera. ""This is just like the way the brain evolved, building up in layers,"" Macleod was quoted as saying in the report. However, some scientists remain unconvinced. Just adding more neurons to the brain as things change is not enough, said Kevin Warwick, head of cybernetics at the University of Reading in the UK. The entire neural structure must also adapt.",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/robot-mimics-biological-evolution/articleshow/4081487.cms
